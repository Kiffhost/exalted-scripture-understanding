*Where the Infernal goes, space itself shifts to accommodate her will, revealing paths long forgotten even to the Yozis themselves.*

The Infernal and up to (Essence x2) companions double the speed at which they travel and can always travel at least ten miles a day no matter how harsh the terrain. At times, they stumble through the deserts of Cecelyne for a few minutes before returning far from where they started at the end of a trail of silver sand.

The trail of sand adds three non-Charm dice on rolls to track the Infernal. A character following close behind her can roll (Intelligence + Occult) or (Wits + Survival) to exploit the rifts into Cecelyne before they fully close, gaining this Charm’s benefits. However, if they fail, they’re stranded in the Endless Desert. They can return with a five day journey, though (Wits + Survival) rolls may be needed to navigate the shifting sands.
