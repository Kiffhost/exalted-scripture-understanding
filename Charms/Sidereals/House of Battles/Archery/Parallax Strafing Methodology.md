Space bends together with the Sidereal’s bowstring, opening impossible angles of attack. The Sidereal makes a withering or decisive attack as though she were attacking from a point up (Essence/2, rounded up) range bands in any direction from her, including for her weapon’s range, determining a withering attack’s [[Accuracy]] bonus, whether she needs to aim, the applicability of cover, etc.
