### Prerequisite
[[Extra Limbs]] The mutant has a horselike lower body or similar anatomy. She always enjoys the attack and [[Defense]] bonuses for fighting mounted, and can make impaling attacks with [[Lance|lances]] (Exalted, p. 203). If ridden by another character, she provides a +2 Speed Bonus.

### Drawback
The characterâ€™s [[Extra Limbs]] only benefit move actions.
