After successfully completing a superior project for which the Solar earned gold points, the Solar may consume the entire gold point bonus to experience a surge of new potential. Using this Charm voids the Solar’s gold point bonus, but reduces the goal number of the next superior project by (Essence + 5), while adding an additional interval to the roll’s terminus (for extended rolls, see p. 188). Using this Charm also increases the gold point bonus calculation for finishing the project from Artifact Rating * 2 * remaining terminus to Artifact Rating * 3 * remaining terminus. White points gained through superior projects are unaffected by use of this Charm. This Charm only applies to projects of an identical Artifact rating: if the Exalt voided the bonus from a two dot Artifact, this Charm only applies to the next two dot Artifact she attempts. The Exalt may void subsequent bonuses gained with this Charm to increase the Artifact Rating multiplier by one each time (* 3, *4, *5, etc.), reducing the goal number by the current Essence rating (Essence + Essence + 5), and adding an additional terminus (two added instead of one the first time the bonus is voided, three the second time, and so on).
