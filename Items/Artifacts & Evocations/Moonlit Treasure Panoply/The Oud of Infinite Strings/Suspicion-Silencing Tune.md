*Anything sounds plausible when set to the oud’s accompaniment.*
As long as the musician plays, any of her listeners’ [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that would give them reason to disbelieve or suspect her or her allies are treated as one step lower, suppressing Minor [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] entirely. This doesn’t affect Ties of suspicion to specific individuals.
When the musician or one of her allies makes an influence roll against such characters, any penalties for making implausible claims are halved, rounded down.
The musician can take other actions while performing by flurrying them, either with a miscellaneous action to continue playing or a [[Performance]]-based influence roll.
## Resonant
The musician converts the oud’s equipment bonus to a non-Charm success.
