The wielder cuts open twin gateways, spiritual mirrors of the Waymakers. The wielder creates a portal at her location and another at a point within medium range. Characters can use move actions to cross between portals or make attacks. Characters can also make attacks through the portal. The distance between the portals doesn’t count against the attack’s range, and they can potentially bypass cover. Environmental effects like a spreading bonfire can also pass through the portals. On the wielder’s turn, she can use her movement action to reflexively move one of the portals one range band in any direction. 

## Special activation rules

This Charm can be flurried with a disengage roll to enter the portal or a rush roll after entering it with a reflexive move action. 

## Resonant

When an enemy attempts to move through the portals, he must roll (Dexterity + Athletics) against the wielder’s (Wits + Martial Arts) to do so. The wielder may likewise roll to oppose attack rolls or other hostile effects made through a portal, or against a difficulty set by the Storyteller for unrolled effects and environmental effects.
