*The Lunar is wise to her enemies’ ways, rarely caught off guard by even the most silken-tongued schemer.*
This Charm can be used after the Lunar discerns a motive she opposes by successfully reading a character’s intentions or profiling him. Every two extra successes on her roll grant +1 [[Resolve]] against any social influence the character employs that scene to advance that motive, maximum ([[Perception]] − 1).
