One who has this gift holds a piece of bread in his hands and tears it perfectly in half, then turns and tears the resulting ends, and continues turning and tearing according to his instinct. The resulting pieces equal twice the bread he started with. It costs one [[Willpower]] to use this ritual on a single large loaf of bread or several smaller hanks. 

Almost every century since the rise of the [[Scarlet Empress]] has seen a prophet with the gift of [[Second Bread]]. The most recent was a madman in Nexus, who used old crusts to feed starving children until a Guildsman beat him into a coma for slowing down foot traffic.
