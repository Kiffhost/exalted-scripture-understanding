*Those who chase after the Dragon-Blood may as well hunt phantoms.*
She rolls to conceal her tracks with double 8s. Additionally, a character that fails the roll becomes lost in the wilderness he’s [[tracking]] her through, chasing the Exalt’s false trails until he loses all sense of location and bearing. Escaping the wilderness requires a difficulty 5 ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) roll to locate a path leading out. On a failed roll, that character must wait until the next day before he can retry it. This doesn’t prevent him from using magic to ascertain his location or to find a way out without needing to make a [[Survival]] roll.
