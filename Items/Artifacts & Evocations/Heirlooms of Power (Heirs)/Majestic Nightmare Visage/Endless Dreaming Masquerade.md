Evocation enhances Caged within the heartwood and lacquer of [[Majestic Nightmare Visage]] sleeps a dream of infinite deception.
This Evocation enhances the following Dragon-Blooded [[Charms]] as described below:
 - When she uses Instant [[Disguise]] Prana (Dragon-Blooded, p. 205) to disguise herself as the Childe, she can complete the disguise instantly, counting [[Majestic Nightmare Visage]] as suitable equipment.
 - When she uses [[Auspicious First Meeting Attitude]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 261) against fae, she adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm successes.
 - When she uses [[Smoke-Wreathed Mien]] (Exalted, p. 261) against an effect that would contradict her disguise as the Childe, up to ([[Essence]] + [[Manipulation]]) 1s and 2s reroll successes.
 - When she uses [[Still Waters Mask]] (p. 147) to adopt the Childe as a cover identity, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost and may do so instantly.
