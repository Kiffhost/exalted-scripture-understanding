The Lunar casts off all limitations that fetter her needs and desires. Her player designates some type of object she values, craves, or wishes to amass â€” currency, jewels, liquor, artwork, burnt offerings, drugs, etc.
She seeks these out at every opportunity, taking them whenever she has the chance. No matter how much she amasses, she must always seek more. If someone attempts to part her from her hoard, she must forcefully defend it, and will employ violence to retrieve any piece of her hoard stolen from her.
This ends if the Lunar harms someone toward whom she has a positive Tie as a result of it.
