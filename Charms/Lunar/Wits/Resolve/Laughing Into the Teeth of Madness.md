The Lunar is the ultimate master of herself, endlessly defining and redefining her nature. She can use Resisting the Lure of Madness to enhance Resolve or opposed rolls against shaping effects (p. XX). Against shaping effects that don’t allow such forms of resistance, the Lunar may pay two motes to force a contest, rolling (her Essence + current temporary Willpower) against the opposing character’s (current temporary Willpower). If the shaping isn’t created by a character, the Storyteller sets a difficulty. Both characters must pay one Willpower per failed die on their roll. Success diminishes the shaping — the Lunar can’t be altered in a way that prevents her from shapeshifting or using her Charms, and if a transformation would be permanent or fatal, the Storyteller devises a condition by which it may be broken. The Lunar doesn’t automatically learn the condition, but appropriate Lore, Medicine, or Occult rolls may reveal it. Alternatively, against any magic that would force the Lunar out of a form she’s shapeshifted into, such as Eye of the Unconquered Sun (Exalted, p. 273), she may use this Charm to force an opposed roll, as above, doubling 9s. Success negates that effect and renders her immune to it for the scene.
