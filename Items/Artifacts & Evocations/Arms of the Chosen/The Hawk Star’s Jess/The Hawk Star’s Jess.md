Among the oldest known artifacts, dating back to the Divine Revolution, this weapon’s forgotten maker tamed the mighty Hawk Star, binding a measure of its power into a fist-sized starstone to be spun into wire and woven into a sling. Together, that Sidereal and the Hawk Star’s Jess cast down many demons and behemoths that served the enemies of the gods. The Jess has been used many times since to defeat powerful, dangerous foes that threatened the order of Creation. Its stones slew gigantes of Dis in their days of empire, struck down a Solar prince in the Usurpation, and pierced thebrainofthemile-highwolfstagthatfolloweditsraksha masters into the world during the Contagion. It remains a valued tool in the hands of the Five-Score Fellowship, loaned out to end marauding demons, behemoths, and other mighty monsters that oppose the will of Heaven.
