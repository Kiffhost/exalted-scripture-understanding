*Wrenching mead-halls’ doors from their hinges or charging through stone walls, the Lunar spreads fear and destruction.*
A successful feat of strength counts as a threaten roll against enemies who witnessed it. In combat, affected enemies lose one [[Initiative]]. On a [[Strength]] 5+ feat, they lose [[Initiative]] even if they resist with [[Willpower]].

## Protean 
In animal shapes capable of [[Strength]] 5+ feats, the Lunar gains one [[Initiative]] on a successful feat.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has a special ability or [[Merits]] that involves threaten rolls or other fearbased influence may learn this as an [[Appearance]] Charm, with [[Glance-Oration Technique]] as its prerequisite.
