Carrying 100 murderers upon her back or in her hand, the Solar gains a keen sense for hunting killers. Wielding Shih Azen’s weapon grants her one automatic success on Awareness rolls to detect the main target of an investigation she’s undertaking, as established by successful evidencegathering actions. It also gives her one die on Investigation rolls to examine or discover evidence produced by a serial murderer, as established by the Storyteller. This doesn’t confer knowledge of the crime or the criminal’s identity or the fact that they are a murderer to the wielder, it only enhances her chances of discovering a pattern. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost once the Solar has successfully investigated a killer and slain them with Black Wind.
