The Sidereal pledges herself to her patron Maiden in sacred marriage, catching the light of the Pillar’s stars for her wedding band. To learn this Charm, the Sidereal must have a positive Defining Tie to her patron Maiden. 
-  Her Tie to her Maiden can’t be weakened or altered and she can’t gain negative Ties to the Maiden. Anyone who sees her ring is aware of her [[Intimacy]], though those unfamiliar with the Maidens perceive it as being directed to that Maiden’s purview instead. 
-  Sidereals, the Bureau of Destiny’s gods, and spirits associated with the Maiden’s purview who see the ring treat their negative Ties toward her as one step lower, and she benefits from their positive Ties to her Maiden. 
-  Whenever she fulfills an auspicious prospect, she sees her Maiden smiling. This counts as upholding her Tie. 
-  She waives the cost of reducing target numbers with [[Excellencies]] on rolls with any Ability for a prophecy of one of her Maiden’s constellations. The ring of stardust can’t be removed. If the Sidereal needs to conceal it, she rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Larceny]]) against the ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) of onlookers, who suffer +2 target number. Trivial characters don’t receive a roll. It can’t be concealed at burning anima or higher.
