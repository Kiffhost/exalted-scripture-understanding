Nothing can stand between the wielder and the object of her wrath. She rerolls two failures on all combat rolls to attack, pursue, or contest the escape of the offender, and rerolls two failures on all attack rolls and threaten actions against his minions. Difficult terrain never impedes her from moving towards the offender or a minion, nor does anything less than full cover provide any benefit to them against her attacks.
