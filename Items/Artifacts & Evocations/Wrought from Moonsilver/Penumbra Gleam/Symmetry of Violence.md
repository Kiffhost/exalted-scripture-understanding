Turning a foe’s strength against him, the wielder conjures his reflection from within Penumbra Gleam’s surface to strike back. She clashes an attack with a decisive attack, using her attacker’s [[Initiative]] instead of her own to determine damage. She may spend up to (Perception/2) Reflection to add that many dice to the attack and damage rolls. Additionally, she can duplicate any Supplemental or Reflexive magic enhancing the attack for (effect’s minimum [[Essence]] + 3) Reflection each. This doesn’t reset her [[Initiative]]. Unlike most clashes, this can be combined with Broken Sword Echo’s counterattack. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy by blocking his decisive attack. 
 
## Resonant

Only characters resonant with [[Penumbra Gleam]] can awaken this Evocation.
