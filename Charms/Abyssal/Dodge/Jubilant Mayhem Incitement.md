*Arrows fly and blades swing seemingly at random, inciting pandemonium among the deathknight’s foes.*
The Abyssal may pay three motes and two [[Initiative]] when she redirects an attack with [[Artless Arrows Spurned]], make the redirected attack a surprise attack.
The redirected attack also counts as a special instill roll against all enemies who witness it, other than the original attacker. The redirected attack’s target applies any [[Defense]] penalties he suffers to his [[Resolve]] as well against this.
Affected characters believe the attacker struck his ally out of malice, incompetence, or inexcusable carelessness. This weakens positive Ties toward him for characters who have them, and instills negative Ties with a context chosen by the target’s player for those who don’t.
