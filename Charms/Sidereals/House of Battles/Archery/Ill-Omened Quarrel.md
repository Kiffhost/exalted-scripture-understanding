*Firing only at the perfect moment, the Sidereal forces her enemy onto an inauspicious footing.*
The Sidereal can pay a one-mote surcharge when she uses Flaw-Revealing Tactic, preventing her target’s onslaught penalty from refreshing on his next turn if her gambit succeeds.
![[Distract Gambits and Cost Reduction]] The attack enhanced by the Sidereal’s gambit adds additional dice of decisive or post-soak withering damage equal to the target’s onslaught penalty.
