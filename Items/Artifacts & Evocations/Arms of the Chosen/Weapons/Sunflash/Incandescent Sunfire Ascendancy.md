Those who witness Sunflash in battle know that it is the god-weapon and that their defeat is a holy thing. Whenever the wielder crashes an enemy or deals enough damage to a battle group to reduce its Size, Sunflash gains a level of anima. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be awakened with experience points. It awakens at no cost when the wielder receives Kiragaru’s blessing upon Sunflash, either in person or through a miraculous display. If she can confront the god outright in social influence, she may convince him to confer this blessing as a serious task (Exalted, p. 216). However, the god’s preference is to stealthily follow the weapon’s wielder, observing how they use it and either judging the wielder worthy or charging her with a trial to atone for her sins.
