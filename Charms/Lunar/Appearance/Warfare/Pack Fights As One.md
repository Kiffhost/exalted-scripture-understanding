The Lunar and her allies fight as one, a pack rallied against a common foe.
To use this Charm, Wasp-and-Termite Dance must be active. The Lunar and all other affected characters gain the following benefits:  - Their communication transcends body language, speaking soul to soul. It’s impossible for outsiders to detect unless they have specialized magic.
 - Pack members’ positive Ties to each other increase their Resolve bonus by one.
 - On each pack member’s turn, he can reflexively take either a defend other or distract gambit to benefit another pack member.
 - As long as one pack member is aware of a hidden threat, all of them are. This may render them immune to unexpected attacks or allow them to attack concealed enemies.

## Archetype 
Lunars with hive-dwelling spirit shapes may learn this as a Charisma Charm.
