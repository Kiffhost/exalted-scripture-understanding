*Run fast, run far â€” it matters not. The Infernal's vengeance is inescapable.*

The Infernal takes an aim action, converting the dice added by it to non-Charm successes on the attack roll. If the Infernal has a Tie of hatred toward her target, the attack that benefits from the aim action ignores Defense bonuses from light and medium cover. She also ignores up to (Intimacy) points of penalties from external conditions, like poor visibility or bad weather.

The Infernal's precision allows her to attack even through full cover as long as there's any opening for the attack. However, such enemies still receive +3 non-Charm Defense from the cover. With a Tie of hatred, this bonus is reduced by (Intimacy).

### Keys
#### Murderous Clarity Focus (Archery 3)
The Infernal can ignore penalties of any kind if she has a Tie of hatred, including Accuracy penalties.
#### Bitter-Hearted Barb (Archery 4)
The Infernal can reflexively form a Minor Tie of hatred toward the enemy she aims at. If she already has such an Intimacy, she ignores an additional point of penalty and reduces the Defense bonus from full cover by an additional point.
#### Exquisite Slaughter Precision (Archery 5, Essence 2, Bitter-Hearted Barb, Murderous Clarity Focus) (+2m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm reflexively before making a decisive attack. The mote surcharge is waived if she has a Major or Defining Tie of hatred toward her target.
#### Devil Huntress Pursuit (Essence 3, Exquisite Slaughter Precision) (+1m, 1i)
For a one-mote, one-Initiative surcharge, the Infernal can take a move action and use this Charm on the same turn, and can flurry it with a rush or disengage. She waives Exquisite Slaughter Precision's Willpower surcharge if she uses it on the same turn she moves toward her target using this key.
#### Merciless Sniper Execution (Essence 4, Exquisite Slaughter Precision)
The Infernal waives Exquisite Slaughter Precision's Willpower cost against crashed enemies.
Aiming and Charms Charms that create and enhance aim actions are limited by the usual Ability restrictions: e.g., Unwavering Hatred Accuity can't benefit a Melee attack.
