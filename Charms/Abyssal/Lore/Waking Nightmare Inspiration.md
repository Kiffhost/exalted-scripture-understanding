*Delving into the depths of nightmare, the Abyssal emerges haunted by what she has witnessed.*
The Abyssal enters a fugue-like trance, gaining a temporary Lore specialty from the forbidden knowledge her waking nightmares reveal. The specialty must involve death, the undead, the Underworld, ancestor worship, disease, poison, or other subjects thematically appropriate to the Abyssal Exalted.
The Abyssal’s eerie half-sleep also grants her +1 Guile, as well as +1 Resolve against influence unrelated to the Lore specialty. However, she suffers a −1 penalty on Perception-based rolls that don’t involve the specialty.
### Whispers
The Abyssal may invoke her Whispers to change the chosen specialty as her waking nightmares shift and distort.
## Reset
Once per day.
