*The Abyssal enfolds herself in ranks of protective steel, armored in her soldiers’ willingness to lay down their lives for her.*
The Abyssal directs an allied battle group to protect her with a reflexive defend other action. It must still be within close range of her to protect her, but can move up to one range band toward her without using its movement action if necessary.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm in response to an attack against her, the battle group adds (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) Parry against that attack.
