Unleashing the tempest within, the Dragon-Blood channels her [[Essence]] through her weapon and into a deadly levinbolt. She makes an unblockable decisive attack against an enemy within short range, and halves [[Hardness]] from metal armor (including armor made from the five magical materials).
In Air Aura, the Dragon-Blood can attack out to medium range without needing to aim. If she aims before attacking, she adds the aiming bonus to her decisive damage as well as the attack roll. Aiming before using this Charm counts as aiming at an enemy within close range for the purpose of other Dragon-Blooded [[Melee]] [[Charms]], like [[Oncoming Storm Stance]] (p. 140).
This Charm can only be used once per scene unless reset by dealing 5+ withering or 1+ decisive damage to a nontrivial enemy with an attack from close range.
