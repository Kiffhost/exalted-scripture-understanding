A swordsman faces the woman wielding the Forgotten Blade. Suddenly, the Blade is stained red. He feels blood drip from a stinging cut in his side. But when did she wound him? How did she strike him? He cannot recall. Much of swordplay lies in adjusting your defense so that a strike that pierces your guard once cannot do so a second time. With this Evocation, when the wielder successfully delivers a decisive attack, she erases her opponent’s memory of her technique so he cannot keep her from doing it again, imposing a −1 penalty on that target’s Defense against her decisive attacks until the next time she lands a decisive attack without using this Evocation. The penalty can be stacked up to a total of (Essence) times. Treat memory-excising gambits and normal decisive attacks as interchangeable for purposes of this Evocation. If used in conjunction with another gambit, the penalty only applies against that particular gambit.
