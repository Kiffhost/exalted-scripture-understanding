*Purify the world with flame; let each slain devil be a spark.*
The stylist makes a decisive attack against an enemy suffering from her Paralyzing Combustion Imbuement. Her weapon shines with brilliant light, leaving a white-hot afterimage seared on the eyes of those who witness it. She adds (Essence) attack roll extra successes as dice of damage, or (Essence + Occult) successes against a creature of darkness.
If she damages a nontrivial creature of darkness with this attack, the light emanating from within it flares out to strike each other creature of darkness within medium range, wreathing them in ghostly bonfires. Each one suffers one die of aggravated damage, plus an additional die for every 10 on the first damage roll, ignoring Hardness. Those damaged begin to shine, suffering the effect of Paralyzing Combustion Imbuement. 
## Mastery
After incapacitating a nontrivial creature of darkness and resetting to base Initiative, the stylist may use Devil-Slaying Spear Dance to roll a rush against all enemies caught in this Charm’s bonfires. She moves in a blur of blinding motion, coming into close range of each rushed enemy and making a decisive attack against him before moving on to the next. Her Initiative doesn’t reset to base until she’s completed all attacks. 
## Terrestrial
This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy suffering from the stylist’s Paralyzing Combustion Imbuement.
