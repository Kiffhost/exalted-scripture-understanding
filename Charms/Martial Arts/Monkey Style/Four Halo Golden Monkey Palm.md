*Monkey grandmasters speak of the Four Gates, meridians of [[Essence]] thought to be wellsprings of passion and virtue.The style’s finishing move is a strike to one of these gates that seals its wellspring.*
The stylist strikes one of her target’s gates using one of the gambits below, making a decisive attack. All of these gambits have difficulty equal to the target’s [[Resolve]], modified by any applicable Intimacies. Success alters her target’s mood or behavior for the rest of the scene: 
These gambits are both Psyche effects and crippling effects. They can be resisted for two [[Willpower]]. Those who do so must roll [[Initiative]], losing one [[Initiative]] for each die that rolls a failure. Doing so renders them immune to this Charm’s gambits for the rest of the scene.
This Charm is compatible with Monkey [[Charms]] that enhance disarm or distract gambits. It can be used against enemies without the relevant anatomy with appropriate stunting.
### Monkey Mocks the Crown 
The Crown Gate, located in the brow, is said to be the font of reason, wisdom, and self-discipline. This gambit reduces its victim to humiliating capering. They must take an action each turn to engage in some demeaning frivolity, requiring him to flurry to take other actions. He can still take actions that couldn’t normally be flurried, like using Simple [[Charms]], though he must humiliate himself as he does so. Anyone who sees this and has a Tie to the gambit’s victim that’s inconsistent with his debasing behavior weakens the Tie’s intensity by one unless they spend one [[Willpower]].
### Monkey Spills the Chalice
The Chalice Gate, located in the heart, is seen as the seat of empathy, love, and mercy, the gate that governs strong relationships. This gambit renders its victim incapable of considering or prioritizing the needs of others. Any positive Ties he has are suppressed. He can’t use defend other actions, distract gambits, or other forms of teamwork. Unless he thinks continuing to fight is in his best interest, he’ll attempt to retreat, negotiate a surrender, or otherwise advance his own interests over anyone else’s.
### Monkey Fouls the Throne
The Throne Gate, located in the navel, is thought to be the source of ambition, will, and drive. This gambit renders its victim incapable of restraint. He suffers −2 [[Defense]], [[Guile]], and [[Resolve]].
At the end of each of his turns, he loses five [[Initiative]] unless he made a decisive attack or spent at least seven motes or one [[Willpower]] on an attack. He can’t disengage, withdraw, or take full defense actions.
### Monkey Plucks the Root
The Root Gate, located in the groin, is said to be the seat of courage, wrathful passions, and fighting spirit. This gambit breaks its victim’s will to fight. He gains a Major Tie of fear toward the stylist, or strengthens an existing Tie to Defining.
At the end of each of his turns, he loses five [[Initiative]] unless he took a movement action to move away from the stylist or rolled [[Stealth]] to establish concealment. He can’t attack, threaten, or rush the stylist.
## Special activation rules
When the stylist uses [[Lost Monkey Escapade]], she can use this Charm reflexively for the attack.
## Mastery
The stylist inflicts decisive damage equal to her extra successes on the gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll.
## Terrestrial
The gambit’s effect ends if the victim crashes or incapacitates the stylist.
