*Fools who rouse the Infernal’s rage rarely survive to regret it.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she takes decisive damage, entering a berserk fury:
- She adds an automatic success on attack rolls. This is non-Charm if the Infernal’s target has been knocked prone, is a mortal, or has been dealt 3+ levels of decisive damage by the Infernal this scene.
- She reduces any wound or crippling penalties she suffers by (Stamina/2, rounded up).
- She gains +2 Resolve against fear-based influence and influence that would cause her to surrender. She also gains this bonus against any influence used by mortals.
- She can’t withdraw, use social influence for purposes unrelated to combat, or cease fighting until all enemies are incapacitated or have fled. She’s still capable of tactical thinking and intelligent decision.

Ending this Charm prematurely crashes the Infernal, setting her to Initiative –3 (if not already lower).

With Brawl 5, the Infernal can use this Charm upon taking withering damage.
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm upon entering her [[Devil-Body]].
### Keys
#### Smoldering Rage Beast (Brawl 5)
The Infernal can use this Charm in response to any form of threat, insult, bad news, or unwanted physical contact. This includes attacks that missed her.
#### All-Consuming Rampage Release (Brawl 4, Essence 2)
If the Infernal prevails in battle against at least one nontrivial foe, she gains one Willpower and loses one Limit at the end of this Charm’s duration. She doesn’t gain this benefit if the Charm ends prematurely. She likewise doesn’t gain any benefit if she was incapacitated or otherwise defeated, even if her allies triumphed.
#### Fearless Frenzy Attitude (Brawl 5, [[#All-Consuming Rampage Release (Brawl 4, Essence 2)|All-Consuming Rampage Release]])
The Infernal treats fear-based influence and influence that would cause her to surrender as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220).
#### Fury is Freedom (Essence 3, [[#Fearless Frenzy Attitude (Brawl 5, All-Consuming Rampage Release (Brawl 4, Essence 2) All-Consuming Rampage Release )|Fearless Frenzy Attitude]])
Any Psyche effects afflicting the Infernal are suppressed for this Charm’s duration. The Resolve bonus from her berserker rage applies against Psyche effects as well.
#### Untamed Apocalypse Beast (Essence 5, [[#Fury is Freedom (Essence 3, Fearless Frenzy Attitude (Brawl 5, All-Consuming Rampage Release (Brawl 4, Essence 2) All-Consuming Rampage Release ) Fearless Frenzy Attitude )|Fury is Freedom]], [[#Smoldering Rage Beast (Brawl 5)|Smoldering Rage Beast]]) (+3m, 1wp)
The Infernal can use this Charm without provocation, and may pay a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extends its duration to Indefinite. Ending the Charm voluntarily causes her to lose three Willpower unless she does so upon triggering [[#All-Consuming Rampage Release (Brawl 4, Essence 2)|All-Consuming Rampage Release]].
