The Lunar creates toxic skin glands or venom ducts, lacing her attack with deadly potency. She envenoms a decisive attack with a poison with Damage 2i/round (B in Crash), Duration (Stamina) rounds, and a –2 penalty. Alternatively, she may substitute the poison of any animal form she possesses. Normally, this can only enhance unarmed or natural attacks, but she can envenom close-range weapons or physical projectiles with stunts. 
## Protean 

In venomous or poisonous shapes, this Charm may instead increase a dose’s duration by (Essence). 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is venomous or poisonous may learn this as a Wits Charm.
