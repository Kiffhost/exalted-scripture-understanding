The Exalt draws upon her own momentum to bend and flow with opposing forces. For every two [[Initiative]] spent in response to an attack, the player may raise the Exaltâ€™s [[Defense|Evasion]] by one. [[Reed in the Wind]] raises the cap on how much the Solar can enhance her [[Defense|Evasion]] by her [[Essence]]. At [[Dodge]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, a successful dodge with [[Reed in the Wind]] restores one mote. This bonus may only occur once per round.
