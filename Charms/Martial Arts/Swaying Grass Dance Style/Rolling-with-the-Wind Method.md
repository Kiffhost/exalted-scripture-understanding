Swift to react to danger, the dancer adapts to her enemy’s rhythm. After being hit, but before a damage roll, she reflexively disengages. If successful, the post-soak damage of a withering attack is halved, rounded up, while a decisive attack’s damage takes a penalty of −(her extra successes against the attacker’s opposed roll), maximum −(Performance), and she moves one range band away from her attacker after the damage roll. This counts as her movement action that round, but if she’s already taken one, she may have it count as her movement for the next round instead. 
## Terrestrial

The dancer can’t reduce withering damage by more than her extra successes against the attacker’s opposed roll. She can’t use this Charm if she’s already taken a movement action this round.
