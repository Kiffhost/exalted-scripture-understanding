*The deathknight’s steed draws strength from its bond with her.*
While the Abyssal is riding or within close range of her mount, it adds (her Essence) dice to the raw damage of its withering and decisive attacks, and can pay one Initiative to reflexively protect the deathknight with a defend other action. Doing so grants it +1 Defense, maximum 5, until its next turn.
