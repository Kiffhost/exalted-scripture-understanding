*Strife’s Crucible seeks to fight not to the death, but to its opponents’ edification.*
It encourages its wielder to taste first blood, but no more. [[Strife’s Crucible]] gains a special pool of [[Willpower]] that begins empty, but gains one point each time the wielder crashes or incapacitates her chosen opponent (maximum 10). The wielder may only spend [[Willpower]] from this pool on the following: 
- Resisting social influence. 
- Increasing [[Defense|Parry]]. 
- Paying the costs of this Artifact’s [[Evocations]]. 
- Bestowing [[Willpower]] on defeated opponents. [[Willpower]] stored in [[Strife’s Crucible]] fades away if it isn’t used by end of story. 

## Resonant

The wielder may use [[Willpower]] from [[Strife’s Crucible]] to pay the costs of [[Charms]] that supplement a gambit made with it, or defensive [[Charms]] she uses to parry with it.
