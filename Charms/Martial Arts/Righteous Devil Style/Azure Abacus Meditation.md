*Closing her eyes, the Righteous Devil perceives the ebb and flow of [[Essence]] around her through a mandala of blue rings, nine notched discs of silver-blue light that spin around her foes in her mind’s eye. If her anima banner is at the bonfire level, this azure abacus becomes visible to all within its light, the silvery rings orbiting around the stylist and aligning as she lines up a shot.*
Firing through this reticule mandala hones in on an enemy’s weakest point, granting benefits commensurate to the enemy’s level of cover. 
- Enemies that do not benefit from cover lose all soak against the attack, except for that provided by [[Charms]] and other magical effects. [[Artifact]] armor is not considered a magical effect. 
- Enemies under light cover halve their mundane soak against the attack. 
- Enemies under heavy cover subtract -1 from their mundane soak for every extra success on the attack roll, but not below half their full value. 
- Enemies under full cover are unaffected.
## Reset
[[Azure Abacus Meditation]] may only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully landing a decisive attack against an enemy under light or heavy cover and then building up to [[Initiative]] 12+. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood always treat enemies as having at least light cover with this Charm, preventing her from fully negating soak.
