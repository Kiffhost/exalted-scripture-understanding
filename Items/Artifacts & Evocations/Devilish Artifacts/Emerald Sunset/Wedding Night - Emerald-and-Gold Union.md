*Like two suns comingling, Emerald Sunset brings together the Essence of Creation and Hell into a grand and terrible union.*

The wielder immolates a willing Second or Third Circle Demon within short range, mantling its Essence in the form of a gold-green halo. Emerald Sunset is wreathed in hellfire, and a faint image of the demon towers over its wielder. She gains the following benefits:
- She adds (demon’s Essence/2, rounded up) to her withering attack’s raw damage and Overwhelming, and on Initiative rolls for [[Second Arrow of the Prince - Verdigris Grief Punishment]].
- She regains two additional motes at the start of each of her turn.
- She counts as fulfilling an additional condition for [[First Arrow of the Prince - Baleful Sunset Glare]] and for [[Third Arrow of the Prince - Weeping Sky Elegy]]’s Initiative recovery.
- She can use [[Fourth Arrow of the Prince - Supreme Authority Proclamation]] as if the mantled demon were her arrow, without causing any harm to it.
- She can use any Eclipse Charm known to the demon, and can use offensive Eclipse Charms that are normally incompatible with ranged attacks with Emerald Sunset as long as this makes sense.
- She counts as a demon of the same Circle whenever it’s advantageous for her.
- Demons with Ties of fear, awe or similar towards her cannot attack her, even at the order of a sorcerer who’s bound them.

The absorbed demon has no independent existence while mantled. It can’t take action or be targeted by other effects. It reforms without any ill effect when this Evocation ends.
### Resonant
The wielder can use [[Fourth Arrow of the Prince - Supreme Authority Proclamation]] reflexively together with this Evocation, drawing on the mantled demon for both.
### Dissonant
Dissonant characters cannot awaken this Evocation.
## Reset
Once per scene.
