The Siderealâ€™s handiwork smooths tensions between even the most ferocious of enemies, ensuring peace at her table. The Sidereal brings peace to a conversation or event over a meal she prepared, in the presence of her artwork, or in a similar context involving her craft. Those present treat negative Ties to each other as one step weaker. No one can initiate hostilities unless they pay two Willpower or are insulted, provoked, or harmed.
