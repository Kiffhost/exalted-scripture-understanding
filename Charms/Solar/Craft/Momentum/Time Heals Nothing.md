The Lawgiver can press aside the veil of time to deliver the world from its ravages. This Charm allows the Exalt to instantly create a major project slot for the purposes of repairs. This slot vanishes when the repair is completed. An Essence 3+ repurchase allows the Solar to alternately pay six motes, one Willpower to create a temporary superior repair slot.
