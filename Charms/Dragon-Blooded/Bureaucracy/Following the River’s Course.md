It’s easier to understand the tides that bring every piece of flotsam and jetsam than to understand the forces that govern the flow of money, but the Dragon-Blood does both. When she receives payment as part of an economic transaction, she gains a flash of insight into the flow that brought it to her, rolling read intentions with (Perception + Bureaucracy), doubling 9s. If she’s paid in hard currency or physical goods, success lets her discern how the payer obtained them. If she takes payment on credit, success lets her evaluate the actual quality of the payer’s credit and whether or not he intends to fulfill his promises. A Bureaucracy 5, Essence 4 repurchase allows the Dragon-Blood to use this Charm on any payment she observes being made.
