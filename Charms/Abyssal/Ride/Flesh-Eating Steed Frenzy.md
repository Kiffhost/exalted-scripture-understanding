*The Abyssal rouses bloodthirst in even the meekest of beasts, horse and rider moving as one to kill.*
When she Joins Battle, her mount also gains an amount of [[Initiative]] equal to her own, and acts on its own [[Initiative]] for the duration of the combat. It can attack on its own turn without using up the Abyssal’s attack for the round (Exalted, p. 203).
Using this Charm grants the mount a Minor Tie of hunger towards the living, or increases a preexisting Tie’s intensity by one step. If it’s already at Defining intensity, the Abyssal can gain one [[Willpower]] when her mount gains [[Willpower]] for upholding the Tie in the scene she used this Charm, maximum once per scene.
