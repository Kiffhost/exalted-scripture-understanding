The Dragon-Blood radiates desirability and enchanting allure. She makes a persuade roll to seduce a single target. Overcoming his Resolve also instills him with a Minor Tie of lust or desire toward her unless he spends Willpower to resist. In Fire Aura, the Dragon-Blood may convert up to (Essence) bonus dice added by her Appearance (Exalted, p. 218) to non-Charm bonus successes.
