**Example Demesne**: Three spires of black rock worn down by the tides of the Sea of Shadows and strewn with a web of seaweed. Blood-colored amber congeals within this shard of petrified driftwood, which forms only from Abyssal demesnes. 
Its bearer adds a non-Charm success on [[Lore]] rolls involving the Sea of Shadows or other [[Underworld]] waterways, and doesnâ€™t need a [[Lore]] background to introduce or challenge facts about them. She also adds a non-Charm success on [[Intelligence]]-based [[Sail]] or [[Survival]] actions involving such dark waters.
