*An Exalt with this Charm can vanish into the wilderness.*
This Charm affects the Solar and up to ([[Essence]] x2) followers, supplementing a ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) roll to cover the Exalt’s tracks (p. 229). This roll gains ([[Essence]]) automatic successes and is bolstered by the double 9s rule. The Solar cannot be tracked conventionally, not even with the aid of tracking animals or other means—mundane attempts automatically fail. Only those with supernatural prowess can hope to find the vanished Lawgiver.
