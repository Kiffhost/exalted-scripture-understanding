The Sidereal’s unyielding grasp on the thread of her destiny can overcome any defense, but it cares not which of her foes falls before her. When the Sidereal misses with an attack, before losing Initiative she can use this Charm to give her target’s player a choice: either it hits him anyway, or she rerolls the attack and all effects enhancing it as an ambush (Exalted, p. 203) against an enemy of her choice within (Essence) range bands, who her player must name before he chooses. Her Initiative for a redirected decisive attack’s damage is reduced by this Charm’s cost and similar Initiative losses. Reset: Once per scene unless reset when a nontrivial enemy’s choice in response to one of the Sidereal’s Brawl Charms either crashes or deals 3+ decisive damage to another nontrivial enemy.
