*Long ago, the Solars stole the implements of their virtue from beneath the gaze of the gods’ own masters.*
This Charm is similar in all ways to its prerequisite, except that it allows the Solar to steal an object from plain sight. The Exalt might swipe a book from a table or take a sword from a soldier’s scabbard. Such a theft cannot be noticed for (Solar’s [[Essence]]) minutes unless circumstances call attention to it, such as a soldier attempting to draw his stolen blade.
