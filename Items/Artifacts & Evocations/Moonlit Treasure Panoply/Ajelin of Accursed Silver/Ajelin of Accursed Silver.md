**Special:** Ajelin’s death-tainted curse makes it resonant with Abyssals.
**Socketed hearthstones are absorbed into Ajelin’s moonsilver, rendering them immune to harmful effects that specifically target hearthstones.**

Nafiss of Depths forged the blade Ajelin to celebrate the death of the first Ancient in the Divine Revolution, a sword that would stand as eternal proof that even the world’s makers can be slain. She tempered the daiklave in the fallen titan’s blood, not knowing of the dread power that lingered within it. Death’s [[Essence]] tainted Ajelin, tarnishing its moonsilver blade to midnight black. As Nafiss drew it, its moonsilver flowed around her arm, becoming one with its creator as she succumbed to the blade’s curse.
Nafiss turned Ajelin’s direful power against the enemies of the gods, but with every victory, she lost more and more of herself to the sword. When the Divine Revolution came to a close, leaving her with no more foes to slay, she turned against her own. She cut down old allies and beloved companions, terrorizing the Chosen until at last her Circle slew her.
Fearful of the power that had corrupted Nafiss, her Circlemates sealed Ajelin away within her tomb, binding it with seven sorcerous wards. There it remained until the final days of the First Age. Inspired by memories of his past life as Nafiss, the swordsman Mabonai claimed the cursed blade. Sworn to the cause of the Solar Purge, Mabonai willingly surrendered himself to Ajelin, unleashing its terror against the Lawgivers.
Mabonai and Ajelin both vanished after the Usurpation, but the daiklave has reappeared throughout the Second Age. Every hand that’s touched it has felt its curse.
The outcaste Second Thunder wielded it to defend his homeland against an undead horde, but massacred his own people under Ajelin’s sway. Sky Wolf killed his own family after a faerie prince tricked him into taking up the blade, and stained the Wyld red with his revenge.
The [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] follows rumors of Ajelin closely, seeking to reclaim it and seal it away once again, but some would see it brought to bear against the Realm. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of Ajelin
Ajelin’s [[Evocations]] draw power from hatred and rage, poisoning its wielder’s soul until she no longer sees herself as anything but an extension of the blade. They also strengthen the physical bond between wielder and weapon, letting Ajelin spread around her to form moonsilver armor.
When attuned, Ajelin merges with its wielder’s arm and cannot be separated, rendering it impossible to disarm.
The wielder is immune to crippling effects that would completely sever that arm, and can’t choose to take crippling injuries that would do so. She can withdraw Ajelin’s blade, leaving her hand covered in moonsilver like a clawed gauntlet. Doing so requires a ready weapon action, as does unleashing the withdrawn blade.
The wielder can release her attunement to Ajelin to separate from it, but must fight the blade’s influence to do so. She must roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) at difficulty 5. If she fails, she can’t try again for the rest of the session.
Many of Ajelin’s [[Evocations]] rely on its wielder’s Enmity — her strongest [[Intimacy]] involving hatred, rage, or seeing herself as a weapon rather than a person. The [[Intimacy]] must be appropriate to the circumstances — a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of hatred for the Realm might provide the wielder’s enmity in battle against a Wyld Hunt, but not against the Fair Folk.
When Ajelin’s wielder suffers [[Limit Break]], the usual effect is replaced by [[Berserk Anger]] or [[Deliberate Cruelty]] (Exalted, pp. 136-137), or a comparable expression of Ajelin’s curse chosen by the Storyteller. While experiencing [[Limit Break]], she gains +1 Enmity.
