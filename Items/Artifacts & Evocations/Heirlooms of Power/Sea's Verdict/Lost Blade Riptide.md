Sea’s Verdict’s prongs spin and twist, unleashing a whirl of black water that rips weapons away. If an enemy tries to parry a decisive attack, the wielder first reflexively rolls a disarm gambit (Exalted, p. 200), waiving the Initiative cost. A disarmed enemy can only use his Evasion to defend against her attack.
