A tangled web traps its maker. A successful withering attack spins the opponent’s secrets into sticky, binding threads of Essence until the end of his next turn. A bound foe must pay one Initiative in order to take a movement or attack action. If the wielder knows a bound foe’s secrets, she may strike him again with this Evocation, renewing the binding web for another of her enemy’s turns and raising the Initiative cost it imposes by one. She may stack it up to a maximum based on the most potent secret known: 2 for inconvenient; 3 for serious; 4 for life-changing. 

## Resonant

A crashed enemy cannot take movement actions while bound.
