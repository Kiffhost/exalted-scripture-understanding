*The acid-green fire of Ligier wreathes the Infernal’s blade, incinerating her foes.*

If the Infernal deals 3+ levels of damage with a decisive attack, her blade erupts in a flare of emerald flame. She rolls an additional (higher of Essence or 3) dice of decisive damage, ignoring Hardness.
## [[Keys]]
##### Blazing Demonic Radiance (Melee 3)
The Infernal only needs to deal one level of damage to trigger the flare, and the flare deals aggravated damage. Dealing 3+ damage doubles 10s on the flare’s damage.
#### World-Weathering Incandescence (Melee 3)
The Infernal can use this Charm to enhance a feat of demolition made using her weapon, rolling (Strength + Melee) and adding (higher of Essence or 3) dice. Against flammable objects, she converts these to automatic successes. She can complete extended feats instantly: cracks spread across the object, hissing with green flame and wisps of acrid smoke until it’s destroyed.
#### Cold Fire Desolation Brand (Melee 4, Essence 2) (+4m)
For a four-mote surcharge, an enemy damaged by the flare is exposed to [[Green Sun Wasting]]. With Melee 5, Essence 3, the disease can be fatal even for the Exalted.
#### Emerald Pyre Ablaze (Melee 4, [[#World-Weathering Incandescence (Melee 3)|World-Weathering Incandescence]])
An enemy damaged by the flare catches fire. At the start of each of his turns, he suffers another (higher of Essence or 3) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. This damage is aggravated if the Infernal has [[#Blazing Demonic Radiance (Melee 3)|Blazing Demonic Radiance]], but otherwise doesn’t benefit from this Charm’s keys.
#### Viridescent Dawn Flash (Melee 4, Essence 2) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm after an attack roll, but before the damage roll.
#### Immolating Terror Technique (Melee 5, Essence 2) (+4m)
For a four-mote surcharge, an enemy damaged by the flare loses one Willpower and forms a Tie of terrified awe toward the Infernal. He can’t voluntarily weaken it until he’s gone a full day without perceiving the Infernal. If this reduces him to zero Willpower, the Tie is Major instead.
#### Wrath-Stoked Bonfire Soul (Melee 5, Essence 3, [[#Blazing Demonic Radiance (Melee 3)|Blazing Demonic Radiance]], [[#Viridescent Dawn Flash (Melee 4, Essence 2) (+1wp)|Viridescent Dawn Flash]]) (+3m, 1wp)
When the Infernal uses [[Green Sun Nimbus Flare]] against an enemy whose Initiative is at least ten lower than hers, she can pay a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to add her attack roll extra successes to the flare’s damage.
#### Emerald Hellfire Apocalypse ([[#Wrath-Stoked Bonfire Soul (Melee 5, Essence 3, Blazing Demonic Radiance (Melee 3) Blazing Demonic Radiance , Viridescent Dawn Flash (Melee 4, Essence 2) (+1wp) Viridescent Dawn Flash ) (+3m, 1wp)|Wrath-Stoked Bonfire Soul]])
Once per scene, the Infernal can use [[#Wrath-Stoked Bonfire Soul (Melee 5, Essence 3, Blazing Demonic Radiance (Melee 3) Blazing Demonic Radiance , Viridescent Dawn Flash (Melee 4, Essence 2) (+1wp) Viridescent Dawn Flash ) (+3m, 1wp)|Wrath-Stoked Bonfire Soul]] against an enemy regardless of his Initiative.
