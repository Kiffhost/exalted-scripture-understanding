*The Solar trains her body to feel the [[Essence]] of those she would outrun, matching their strength with her stride.*
When she falls behind in a test of speed, every 10 her fastest opponent rolls also counts as a single success to the Solar’s own roll. This Charm also functions in rushes, to aid in countering the target’s attempts to avoid the Solar.
