Subtly mimicking those around her, the Lunar vanishes into bustling crowds or herds of animals. While she’s within short range of a group of four or more characters — a mercenary company, a Dynastic estate’s household servants, a wolf pack — and behaves like other members of the group, observers can’t distinguish her from other group members unless they perceive her [[Lunar Shapeshifting/Tell]]. This Charm ends if she takes an overt action, including Joining Battle or blatantly displaying supernatural power. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as a [[Manipulation]] Charm.
