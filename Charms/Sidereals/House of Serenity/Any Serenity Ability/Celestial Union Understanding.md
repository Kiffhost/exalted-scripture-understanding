The Sidereal understands all the ways fate brings people together. When the Sidereal witnesses an interaction between two people in a relationship — friends, family, lovers, business partners — she makes a special (Perception + Serenity Ability) read intentions roll against the higher of the two’s Guile. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
-  What keeps them together? 
-  What’s the biggest problem facing their relationship? 
-  How far would each of them go to help the other? 
-  Which one of them should I talk to first if I want to accomplish some specific goal? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact. Reset: Once per scene.
