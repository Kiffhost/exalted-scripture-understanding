While using Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit, the Lawgiver pours her Essence into the ship’s hull, merging with the ship’s anima and extending her protection over vessel and crew. This extends lesser but significant defenses against environmental hazards as Element-Resisting Prana; the ship and crew take three less damage per interval, but only a single member of the crew or the ship can be harmed per round, and none can be affected twice in a row.

### On Ash and Storm Aegis

The backer wanted a Charm that would let him fly into a storm, sail into a volcanic eruption, or ride a sand-sea barge through a sandstorm without losing his entire crew. This Charm largely immunizes the crew to toxic fumes, severe heat, and violent winds, though it can’t make them as tough as the Solar. The limited resistance guarantees someone will eventually take some damage, but the number of characters taking damage has been reduced exponentially, so it becomes easily manageable.
