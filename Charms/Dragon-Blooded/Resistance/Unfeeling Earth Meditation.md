The Dragon-Blood suffuses her body with Earth [[Essence]], inuring herself to the pain and frailty of her flesh. She may ignore wound penalties on a single action with any Ability. With an [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, using this Charm in Earth Aura extends its duration for as long as the Dragon-Blood remains in Aura.
