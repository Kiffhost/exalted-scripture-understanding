The Sidereal’s weapon intertwines her fate with her foe’s, making them indistinguishable to the world’s eyes. After resetting to base Initiative from a decisive attack, the Sidereal may use this Charm to trade places with her target, appearing just in time to catch her weapon from the air. She doesn’t cross the intervening space. This can’t affect enemies substantially larger than her unless she uses Loom-Shifting Nudge (p. XX). Reset: Once per scene unless reset by reaching Initiative 12+.
