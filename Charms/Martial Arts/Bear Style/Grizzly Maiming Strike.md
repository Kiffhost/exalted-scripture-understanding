*Rending flesh with deadly claw-blows, the stylist breaks her foes.*
The stylist adds an automatic success on a damage roll.
On a savaging attack against a grappled enemy, she also adds dice of decisive or post-soak withering damage equal to her current rounds of control.
If the attack crashes the stylist’s enemy or deals 3+ levels of decisive damage, it inflicts a −1 crippling penalty on her enemy’s physical rolls until he receives medical treatment. This stacks, up to a maximum of (stylist’s [[Strength]]).
Once per scene, the stylist may invoke **Enduring Frenzy Empowerment**: When a savaging attack incapacitates a nontrivial enemy or raises his crippling penalty to −5, she rolls [[Join Battle]].
## Terrestrial
The stylist can’t use Enduring Frenzy Empowerment.
