*The Infernal’s attention is the highest praise any performer may receive.*

The Infernal lends a captivating glamour to a performance she watches. Neither she nor any other audience member can ignore the performance, attempt to leave it prematurely, or interrupt it. They suffer −3 Guile against any roll that would reveal the performance’s emotional impact on them. This costs one Willpower to resist, or two Willpower if a character seeks to initiate hostilities.

This Charm can’t be used in combat, but it remains active if hostilities break out mid-performance.
## Special activation rules
If the Infernal knows [[Agreeable Devil’s Masquerade]], she can use it reflexively with this Charm to apply its effects to the performance she watches.
## [[Keys]]
#### Captivating Pleasure Chorus (Performance 4)
The Infernal can use this Charm through her own performances.
