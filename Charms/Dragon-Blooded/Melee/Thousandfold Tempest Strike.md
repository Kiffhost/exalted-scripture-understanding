*Driving her lightning-wreathed weapon into the ground at her feet, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a spectacular burst of flashing lightning and deafening thunder, directing the storm’s fury against her foes.*
To use this Charm, she must first take an aim action enhanced with [[Oncoming Storm Stance]], and must have [[Initiative]] 12+.
She rolls a single decisive attack against all characters within close range, friend or foe, making a single attack roll that benefits from aiming and apply it against the [[Defense]] of all targets within the range. Her attack carries a base damage against each hit target equal to the number of motes from [[Oncoming Storm Stance]] [[MUTATIONS]] Mutations are Innate or Purchased [[Merits]] (Exalted, p. 158), mundane or supernatural, that alter or improve a character’s physical body, such as [[Ambidextrous]], [[Giant]], or [[Wings]].
that she spent enhancing the attack, and she divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among between all hit characters, rounding up, to determine the total damage. This attack ignores [[Hardness]] from metal armor (including armor made from the five magical materials).
If the Dragon-Blood knows [[Fulminating Thunderclap Surge]], she may use it reflexively with this Charm to instead strike all characters within short range.
This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy with [[Mela’s Flashing Tongue]].
