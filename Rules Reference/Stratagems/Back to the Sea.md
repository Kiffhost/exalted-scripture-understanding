The victorious general confronts his enemy on terrain that makes escape or retreat impossible. The enemy may literally have his back to the sea, or might be forced to fight at the edge of a cliff or river, or inside of a box canyon, or similar environment. The enemy force cannot take [[Withdraw]] actions; [[Size]] loss indicates massive deaths or surrenders rather than soldiers fleeing the battlefield, so that later regrouping and recovery becomes vastly more difficult if not impossible. [[Slaughter]] actions are vastly more effective than normal. [[Rally for numbers]] actions require 3 successes per point of [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] restored.
