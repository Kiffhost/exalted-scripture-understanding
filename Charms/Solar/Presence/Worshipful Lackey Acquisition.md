As the sun rises in prominence, shadows grow long upon the earth. Whenever the Solar achieves a goal through lecture, prophecy, oration, or other forms of performance, those who conspire against her are twisted against themselves. Enemies who witness her success must roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) with a penalty of the Solar’s [[Essence]], against a difficulty of the Solar’s strongest Social Attribute. Those who fail become enthralled with the Solar’s wisdom and greatness and are inclined to follow her and do as she commands as if they had a Principle defining them as one of her acolytes. The character does not stop hating the Solar, but must grovel, cloy and defer to her for ([[Essence]]) days. Occasionally when this effect ends, if the character was treated well by the Solar, his negative Intimacies for her are diminished or destroyed and he becomes one of her true allies.
