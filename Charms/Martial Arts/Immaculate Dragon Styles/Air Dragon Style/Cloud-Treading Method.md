Following in Mela’s footsteps, the Immaculate walks paths closed to her earthbound brethren. She ignores (higher of Essence or 3) total points of penalties from moving through difficult terrain, moving in concealment, or any other environmental penalties on a movement action. She can traverse surfaces that couldn’t normally bear her weight, such as tree branches or rice paper, although she must end her movement on stable footing. In Air Aura, the Immaculate may walk over liquid or any vapor other than thin air, such as the smoke from a campfire. She must still end her movement on solid ground.
