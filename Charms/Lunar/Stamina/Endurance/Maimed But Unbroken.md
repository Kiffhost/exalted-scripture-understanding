No matter how dire her wounds, the Lunar won’t yield. She reduces the penalty of a crippling effect by (Essence/2, rounded up). After every (7 – Stamina) rounds, the penalty diminishes by an additional point. Once the penalty is reduced to zero, the crippling heals completely. Outside of combat, the injury completely heals after one scene. This Charm can’t heal crippling effects that don’t impose penalties, or total amputation or destruction of limbs and organs.
