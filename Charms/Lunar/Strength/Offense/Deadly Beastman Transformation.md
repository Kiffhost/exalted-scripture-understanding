Flesh and [[Essence]] swelling with the unleashed power of her almighty rage, the Lunar assumes a dread warform. To use this Charm, [[Hybrid Body Transformation]] (p. XX) must be active. The Lunar gains the following benefits: 
-  She adds ([[Strength]]) to the raw damage of her withering attacks. 
-  She adds ([[Strength]]) dice on feats of strength and movement actions. 
-  She adds ([[Strength]]) natural soak. 
-  She treats her [[Strength]] as ([[Essence]]) higher for determining what feats of strength she may attempt. However, the Lunar suffers the following drawbacks in this state: 
-  She suffers a −1 [[Defense]] penalty that can’t be negated. 
-  She loses the benefits of resonance with artifacts, and becomes dissonant with any artifact she’s not normally resonant with.
