---
The martial artist’s anima coalesces into thick layers of scales, and needle-sharp anima fangs extend from her fingertips or weapon. When Snake Form is activated, the martial artist may pay an additional mote and a point of Willpower to enhance it with this serpentine display. Doing so adds the martial artist’s Essence to her soak in addition to the base soak bonus of the form, and adds +2 to the raw damage of all withering Snake attacks she makes. 

## Mastery

The damage bonus of this Charm applies to decisive attacks against any enemy whose Initiative is at least two points lower than the martial artist’s.
