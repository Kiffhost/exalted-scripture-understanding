*The Abyssal’s flesh is sustained by the Essence of death, lending her an uncanny vigor.*
She gains additional health levels based on her Stamina rating:
Stamina 1–2: One −1 level and one −2 level.
Stamina 3–4: One −1 level and two −2 levels.
### Stamina 5
One −0 level, one −1 level, and one −2 level.
This Charm may be purchased (Resistance) times.
If the Abyssal’s Stamina increases, her health levels change to reflect her new rating.
