*Reciting a short paean in praise of things both small and many, the sorcerer disintegrates into a flock of dozens of diminutive birds.*
Her consciousness diffuses across many bodies, becoming the flock’s guiding intelligence. She designates a location within 10 miles, and begins flying toward it. The flock uses her traits, but the only physical actions she can take are movement actions and dodging. She gains +2 [[Defense|Evasion]], although not against area-of-effect attacks, and adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on disengage and withdraw rolls. Outside combat, she flies at ({Dexterity + Athletics} x 2) miles per hour. She can end this spell reflexively at any time. It also ends upon reaching her destination or being incapacitated. 

Sorcerers with this as their control spell can speak to and understand birds, though some may not make for the best conversation. Treat birds and bird-like spirits as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fondness for her. 
# Special activation rules
After collecting the sorcerous motes to cast this spell, the sorcerer may “hold” it rather than casting it. She suffers a −1 penalty to all actions and static values while doing so, as she must will her body not to burst into birds. She can cast it reflexively at any time, although if any enemies are at close range, she must reflexively disengage against them. On failure, the spell is lost. 

# Distortion
(Goal Number 10)
Distorting this spell undermines the flock’s unity, sending it darting in different directions. In combat, the sorcerer must make a difficulty 2 ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) roll each turn, suffering one die of [[Hardness]]-ignoring bashing damage on failure as parts of herself fly away. Outside of combat, she must make this roll each mile, and failure halves her speed, rounded down, for that mile.
