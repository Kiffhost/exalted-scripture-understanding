*Loosing an artful warning shot, the Abyssal destroys her foe’s hopes of escape.*
The Abyssal fires a warning shot as a difficulty 1 gambit against the lower of an enemy’s Defense or Resolve.
Enemies suffer −2 Resolve if their Initiative is lower than the Abyssal’s or they can’t perceive her.
If the gambit succeeds, the Abyssal’s terrified victim suffers a −1 penalty on all rolls for the rest of the scene, which increases to −3 on disengage and Awareness rolls. He also suffers −1 Evasion and Resolve, which increases to −2 while within close range of the Abyssal.
If the victim crashes the Abyssal or deals 3+ decisive damage to her with an attack, he may pay one Willpower to resist this effect.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can use this Charm reflexively on her first turn in combat, and it doesn’t count as her attack for the round. If she wins Join Battle, she can use this Charm immediately, making a gambit against any number of enemies who see the shot. She makes a single Initiative roll, adding +1 difficulty for each nontrivial enemy past the first, up to a maximum difficulty of 4.
