The Lunar’s blade is a quicksilver flash as she defends her charge. She reflexively takes a defend other action (Exalted, p. 196). Her protection lasts for this Charm’s duration, but the ally must remain within close range to receive it. She treats any character attacking her ward as havinglowerInitiativethanherforpurposesofAgileBeast Defense and Bending Before the Storm. This Charm ends if she uses a defend other action on another character.
