Nothing’s sacred. Sometimes familiars get killed. Many of the [[Survival]] [[Charms]] featured here require the Solar to make an investment of experience points in a familiar. These [[Charms]] do not represent a poor investment, nor a guarantee of painful regret in the future. Should the Exalt’s familiar die, the experience points invested into the familiar return to the Solar. These successes directly counter any magical Awarenessbased attempts to pierce the Lawgiver’s camouflaging efforts.
