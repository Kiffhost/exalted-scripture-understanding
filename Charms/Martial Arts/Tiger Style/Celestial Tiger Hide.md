Essence strengthens the martial artist’s skin, suffusing it with the toughness of a tiger’s hide. Celestial Tiger Hide adds the martial artist’s Strength to her natural soak, and grants her Hardness equal to her Essence. She adds +2 to both values against attacks made from long or extreme range. When the martial artist is struck with a decisive attack, she may pay a point of Willpower to deny it to her utmost, shattering the Essence of this Charm against the blow. This final defense, called the Undying Predator’s Roar, immediately ends this Charm, but subtracts the martial artist’s Hardness from the raw damage of the attack. After using the Undying Predator’s Roar, Celestial Tiger Hide cannot be activated again until the martial artist has taken 3+ levels of damage to her health track over the course of the fight.
