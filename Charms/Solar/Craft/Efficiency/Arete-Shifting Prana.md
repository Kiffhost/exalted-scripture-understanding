The Lawgiver may glean knowledge from her existing mastery and use it as the foundation for new works. Upon evoking Arete-Shifting Prana, roll (Intelligence + [relevant Craft]). For each success, the Solar may temporarily convert dots from one of her known Crafts into a conceptually related Craft abilityâ€”for example, changing armoring into weaponsmithing, or shifting leatherworking into tailoring, or tailoring into tapestry-weaving. Conversions where no logical relationship can be established are impossible, such as converting Craft (Cooking) dots into Craft (Tailoring). These converted dots remain useable for the duration of one basic or major project; they cannot be used to support any higher form of crafting project.
