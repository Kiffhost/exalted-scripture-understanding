*When the deathknight stands between her ward and danger, not even death itself may pierce her guard.*
The deathknight reflexively takes a defend other action (Exalted, p. 196). Her protection lasts for this Charmâ€™s duration, but her charge must be within close range of her to receive it. This Charm ends if she uses a defend other action on a different character.
