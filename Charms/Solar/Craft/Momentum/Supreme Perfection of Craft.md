Upon purchasing this Charm, the Solar earns one gold point and (Essence + 2) silver points for every Craft Ability she has rated at 5. This bonus recurs each time the Exalt gains a full night’s sleep, but can be earned no more than once per day, nor can it be earned more than once during a period of narrated downtime (for example, if the Storyteller says “It takes a month for your ship to reach its destination,” and the character crafted throughout that month of sailing, she would be eligible for one bonus, not 28 of them).
