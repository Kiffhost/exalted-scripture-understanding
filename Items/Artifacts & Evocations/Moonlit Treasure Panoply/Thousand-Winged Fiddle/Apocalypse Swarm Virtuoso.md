Playing with fervent intensity, the fiddler calls a plague of locusts to descend upon the battlefield.
When the Lunar uses [[Wild Fury Awakening]] (Lunars, p. 175) to call a battle group of insects, she gains the following benefits  - The battle group appears in a single round.
 - The battle group has elite [[Drill]] and [[Might]] 2.
Battle groups of grasshoppers have [[Might]] 3.
 - The battle group gains +1 [[Size]] and adds (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) to its Magnitude (Exalted, p. 208).
 - The battle group adds three dice to all dice pools, maximum 14. For pools lower than six dice, add four dice instead.
 - The battle group’s attacks gain +3 Damage and Overwhelming (Lunar’s [[Essence]]).
 - The battle group adds +2 [[Defense|Evasion]] and [[Defense|Parry]], maximum 7. For values lower than 3, add +3 instead.
 - The battle group adds +5 soak, maximum 15, and gains [[Hardness]] (Lunar’s [[Essence]] + 2).
 - If the battle group’s members have the Minuscule [[Size]] or Tiny Creature [[Merits]], their attacks deal damage normally to larger enemies.
 - The Lunar gains the Charm’s Protean benefit regardless of her shape.
If the Lunar uses [[Wild Fury Awakening]] to summon a battle group of grasshoppers, its cost is reduced to five motes, one [[Willpower]].
# WHAT’S INSECT-LIKE? 
“Insect-like being” is a broad category that the Storyteller should apply generously. Examples include shapeshifters in insect forms, spirits or raksha with insects’ heads or whose bodies resemble them, and insect beastfolk. Note that effects that apply only to grasshoppers don’t apply to grasshopper-like beings.
