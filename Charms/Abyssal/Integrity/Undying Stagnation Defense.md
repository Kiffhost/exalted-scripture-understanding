*The Abyssal permeates her being with death’s stasis, passing unchanged through the courts of chaos.*
The Abyssal and her equipment are immune to the effects of exposure to the [[Wyld]] and other environment Shaping effects that would alter her body, mind, or equipment. She instinctively senses such perils in time to use this Charm, and can use it even while asleep or incapacitated.
[[Wyld]] Exposure Resisting exposure to the [[Wyld]] is a ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) roll; failure results in unwanted transformation that count as [[Flaws]] (Exalted, p. 167), addiction, or Derangements. The difficulty, consequences for failure, and frequency at which the roll must be made depend on the Wyld’s intensity. Certain ritual practices, meditative disciplines, and warding talismans may add bonus dice; accepting faerie hospitality may impose penalties. Once a character fails a roll against exposure, she doesn’t need to make rolls for that specific location again for the rest of the story.
Different [[Wyld]] locales have their own distinctive character. The mutations they inflict reflect this: a glacial ziggurat transforms people into living ice; a subterranean labyrinth twists those who pass through it into pale, elongated creatures; a forest of speaking beasts traps humans in animalistic forms.
