*Solar Circle [[Templates/sorcery]] The final secrets of power are those that cost the most.*
Whenever Soulfarer’s wielder suffers decisive damage, each damaged health level grants her banked sorcerous motes equal to its wound level (−0 levels grant one sorcerous mote). These motes last until the end of the scene. In addition, this Evocation allows one Solar Circle spell to be drawn from [[Soulfarer]], as per the resonant effect of [[Blood-Stained Secrets Initiation]]. Casting this spell costs an additional aggravated health level in addition to the usual cost.
