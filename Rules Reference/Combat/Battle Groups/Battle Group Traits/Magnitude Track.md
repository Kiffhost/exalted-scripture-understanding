[[Battle Group]]s don’t have [[Health Track]]s. Instead, they have a number of points of Magnitude equal to the number of health levels contained in the [[Health Track]] of the average fighter in the group (usually seven), plus their current [[Size]].

When a battle group loses all of its Magnitude, it must check for [[Rout]]. If the battle group survives its rout check, its Magnitude rating re-fills completely, and it loses a point of [[Size]]. Any damage in excess of the unit’s [[Magnitude Track]] during a rout check ‘rolls over’ into the new Magnitude Track—it’s even potentially possible for a strong enough attack to fill up this new track immediately, forcing another rout check!

If a character causes a battle group to lose a point of [[Size]] or to dissolve, she gains an [[Initiative#Break]] bonus, just as though she’d sent an opponent into [[Initiative#Crash]].

**It’s important to understand what Magnitude damage represents**. Partially, it means dead or unconscious fighters, but it also represents damage to the group’s morale— having the allies on either side of you cut down tests a person’s resolve to stand and keep fighting, despite the dangerous likelihood that you may be next; in fact, without your fellows-at-arms, you’re more likely to be next. Thus, Magnitude damage is a mixture of incapacitated combatants and those who have lost the will to fight, or have stopped fighting effectively.
