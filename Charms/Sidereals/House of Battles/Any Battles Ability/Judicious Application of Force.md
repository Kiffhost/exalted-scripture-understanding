The Sidereal’s experience serving destiny has taught her that she must sometimes take a blunt approach. The Sidereal can use Strength instead of Dexterity on nonranged attacks with heavy weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons. Such rolls don’t benefit from effects that grant bonus Strength dots, double successes on Strength rolls, or replace her Strength with a higher value.
