*Every choice creates the future that follows it — but sometimes, all choices lead to the same inevitable outcome.*
The stylist makes ({lower of [[Essence]] or Perception} + 1) undodgeable decisive attacks against a single enemy, seeming to multiply into countless reflections that strike from every possible angle. Each attack has base damage ([[Perception]]); she divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among them, rounded up, to determine their total damage. Each ignores [[Hardness]] and [[Defense]] bonuses from full defenses and light or heavy cover. If there’s any possible angle from which an enemy behind full cover could be attacked, she can do so, though he receives +3 non-Charm [[Defense]]. The defend other action and similar effects can’t protect characters from this attack unless enhanced by magic capable of defending against unblockable and undodgeable attacks.
Once all attacks are complete, the stylist appears anywhere she chooses within close range of her target as the reflections shatter into reflective black glass. This is a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty ([[Perception]]) and damage ([[Essence]], maximum 5) against all characters— friend or foe — within close range of her victim, except the stylist. 
## Enlightenment
Non-Excellency [[Charms]] need only have their cost paid once to apply to all attacks the stylist makes.
