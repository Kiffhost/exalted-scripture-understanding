*Planting her weapon in the soil, the Dragon-Blood bids it grow into a sprawling arboreal engine of war.*
She may pay a one-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Arbor Sentinel Technique]] to cause her weapon to grow into a siege weapon (Arms of the Chosen, p. 127): bows and crossbows become ballistas, while flame weapons become fire cannons. The siege weapon still retains the normal benefits of [[Arbor Sentinel Technique]], granting heavy cover to the artillerist and crew and producing its own ammunition (though it must still be reloaded normally).
