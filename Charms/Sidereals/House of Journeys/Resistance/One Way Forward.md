The Sidereal sloughs off that which holds her back, purging her fate of all but its intended course. The Sidereal is immune to forced movement. This doesn’t stop prevent being knocked prone or falls due to gravity. If the Sidereal’s unarmored or using [[Unswerving Juggernaut Principle]], she gains −1 target number on rolls with any Ability against impediments to movement: an [[Athletics]] roll to leap over a pit, a [[Larceny]] roll to pick a lock, a roll against an enemy’s grapple control roll, etc. 

## Special activation rules

This Charm must normally be used after an attack roll, but before damage. If an enemy uses applicable magic after damage is rolled, it can be used at that time instead.
