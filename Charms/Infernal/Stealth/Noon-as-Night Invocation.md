*The Infernal’s shadow warps and distorts as it extends outward in all directions, rising up from the ground to engulf the world in living darkness.*

The Infernal can use this Charm on her turn to create an unnatural darkness that extends out to short range from her. This darkness is absolute, inflicting a −3 visibility penalty, though this doesn’t affect the Infernal.

Mundane light sources can’t shine through the darkness, though supernatural light sources still work. This doesn’t apply to the Infernal’s anima banner unless she wishes it, allowing her to ignore its effects on her Stealth rolls.

Characters within the darkness suffer a −1 success penalty on Awareness rolls opposing the Infernal’s Stealth, in addition to the visibility penalty. They also suffer −1 Defense against her unexpected attacks.
## [[Keys]]
#### All-Engulfing Night (Stealth 5) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay one-Willpower surcharge to extend the darkness out to medium range.
#### Divine Flame Extinguished (Stealth 5)
This darkness can suppress even supernatural light, save for Solar anima banners. Characters with magic or superhuman senses that allow them to see in the dark don’t gain these benefits against the Infernal’s darkness unless their Essence is higher than hers.
#### Soul-Withering Shadows (Stealth 5, Essence 3) (+3m)
For a three-mote surcharge, enemies within the darkness lose (Infernal’s Essence/2, rounded up) motes at the start of their turns. If this Charm’s duration is increased by one of its keys, enemies lose these motes after each hour they spend in the darkness outside of combat.
#### Lost in the Dark (Essence 4, [[#Soul-Withering Shadows (Stealth 5, Essence 3) (+3m)|Soul-Withering Shadows]])
When the Infernal uses [[#Soul-Withering Shadows (Stealth 5, Essence 3) (+3m)|Soul-Withering Shadows]], it breaks the minds of those within the darkness. They lose one Willpower when they’re crashed or when the Infernal deals 3+ decisive damage to them with an unexpected attack.
#### Midnight Dawn Meditation (Essence 4, [[#All-Engulfing Night (Stealth 5) (+1wp)|All-Engulfing Night]]) (+5m, 5i)
Once per day, the Infernal can pay an additional five-mote, five-Initiative surcharge when she uses [[#All-Engulfing Night (Stealth 5) (+1wp)|All-Engulfing Night]] to extend the darkness out to (Essence + 3) range bands and increase this Charm’s duration to (higher of Essence or 3) hours.
#### Sun-Swallowing Darkness (Essence 5, [[#Midnight Dawn Meditation (Essence 4, All-Engulfing Night (Stealth 5) (+1wp) All-Engulfing Night ) (+5m, 5i)|Midnight Dawn Meditation]])
Once per story, when the Infernal uses [[#Midnight Dawn Meditation (Essence 4, All-Engulfing Night (Stealth 5) (+1wp) All-Engulfing Night ) (+5m, 5i)|Midnight Dawn Meditation]], she can extend the darkness out to (Essence) miles and increase this Charm’s duration to one day.
