*The Lunar builds deadly momentum as she rains down countless blows, culminating in a lightning-swift deathblow.*
When she crashes one or more enemies with [[Thousand Claw Affliction]], she can reflexively make a decisive attack against any one foe she hit. Alternatively, she may reflexively activate Octopusand-Spider Barrage, although she can only attack enemies she crashed that tick. 
## Protean 

In shapes with more than four limbs, if the Lunar incapacitates at least one nontrivial opponent, she gains one [[Willpower]].
