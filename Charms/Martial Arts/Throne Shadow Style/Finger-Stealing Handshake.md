The vizier can’t always be assured of her trusted disciples’ presence, but with deft improvisation and well-chosen words, she makes do. The stylist makes a (Charisma + Martial Arts) persuade roll against all enemies, ignoring multiple target penalties, to sway them to her side. This is typically a life-defining task (Exalted, p. 216), though it may only be a serious task for enemies who expect their side to lose, resent their leader, etc. Trivial enemies can be persuaded without needing a supporting Intimacy. Enemies who resist this influence with Willpower lose (stylist’s Essence + extra successes) Initiative, which she doesn’t gain. Persuaded characters gain a Minor Tie of loyalty to the stylist and count as shadow fingers for the scene. Once the scene ends, if she’s able to take on more shadow fingers, she may choose to retain any of them who’re willing to continue on with her. This Charm can only be used once per scene. 
## Terrestrial

Enemies who resist with Willpower lose only (stylist’s Essence) Initiative.
