*In a blur of superhuman speed and shifting flesh, the Lunar relieves foes of their weaponry.*
She makes a disarm gambit against a lower-[[Initiative]] enemy, adding ([[Larceny]]) dice on the attack and [[Initiative]] rolls. If she has a free hand and is within close range of a successfully disarmed enemy, she may reflexively ready the disarmed weapon. If she steals an artifact weapon attuned by another character, she still suffers the penalties for wielding it unattuned (Exalted, p. 594). With [[Essence]] 3+, stealing an artifact weapon breaks its wielderâ€™s attunement, and the Lunar may reflexively commit its attunement cost.
