The Lunar moves with blinding speed to protect her allies, crossing the battlefield faster than a sword is swung.
The Lunar can pay a two-[[Initiative]], one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use [[Ferocious Guardian Beast Stance]] when an ally within long range is attacked, reflexively moving into close range to take a defend other action. This doesn’t count as her movement action.
If the Lunar protects her Solar mate with this Charm, she waives the [[Willpower]] surcharge.

## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack against a nontrivial enemy who’s attacked someone under the Lunar’s protection or her Solar mate this scene.
