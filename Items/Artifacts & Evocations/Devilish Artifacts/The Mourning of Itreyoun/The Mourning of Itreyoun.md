In the sorcerous clashes that marked the end of the First Deliberative, something was unleashed. Some said it was a wishing tree that spanned the sky, or a song that broke all hearts, or a numinous being of light and glory. None could agree on the details, save for three: it was beautiful, it could never be again, and its name was Itreyoun.

Those who witnessed Itreyoun were changed by the experience. They did their best to spread word of the wonder, and though their stories and songs made little sense to outsiders, they communicated a tragic loss of something that should have remained. These storytellers formed a monastic order, the Mourners of Itreyoun, and enjoyed the patronage of those Exalted who succeeded the First Deliberative as masters of Creation.

But the Mourners were mortal, and their tales too would fade in time. Moved by their plight, the Solar arch-sorcerer Yar-Atun bound Berengiere, the Weaver of Voices, to steal their words and spin from them a tapestry to forever memorialize the miracle. The demoness savored each tale as she teased them from the throats of the monks and wove it into her fabric.

The tapestry was rightly considered a masterpiece, and it fascinated Yar-Atun. It hung in the halls of the Hexmanse for a handful of years, but the sorcerer soon grew paranoid and covetous. He ordered it tailored into a beautiful robe by his apprentices, who he then slew, so that he and only he could always hold it close. He met his end at the hands of the sorcerer-cataphract Ostra Luka, who entombed the Mourning of Itreyoun with him.

Only Berengiere remembers Itreyoun. Within the last year, she has called on long-held favors to retrieve the robe from Yar-Atun’s lonely grave. She now ponders which of the Infernal Exalted is worthy of such a princely gift.

The Mourning of Itreyoun is a hooded robe of many-colored cloth, heavy as brocade but soft and airy as byssus to the touch. It is woven with strange, abstract images that fascinate the eye and excite the imagination.

The Mourning of Itreyoun’s wearer suffers no penalty for flurrying influence rolls to inspire melancholy or fascination.

The robe doesn’t count as armor for its compatibility with Martial Arts.
