With a greater expenditure of control, the Exalt may rend the veil with word and voice, giving physical form to a number of immaterial spirit allies. Roll the Solar’s ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]). Each success materializes a single sorcerouslybound demon or familiar spirit. If the Exalt rolls three sixes—no more, no less—all of her spirit allies materialize at once, regardless of the number of successes, and she gains two points of temporary [[Willpower]].
