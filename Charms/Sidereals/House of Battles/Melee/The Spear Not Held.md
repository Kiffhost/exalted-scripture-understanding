Envisioning the outcome of an exchange of blows with her foe countless times in a single instant, the Sidereal weaves her triumph into fate without ever needing to draw her weapon. The Sidereal makes a ([[Perception]] + [[Melee]]) withering attack against an enemy within medium range. Its [[Accuracy]] and Overwhelming are ([[Essence]], maximum 5). The attack is rolled against the target’s [[Guile]]. It likewise uses [[Guile]] instead of natural soak, and ignores armored soak completely. Using this Charm to make an unexpected attack doesn’t break concealment.
