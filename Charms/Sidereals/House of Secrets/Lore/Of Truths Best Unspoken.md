The Sidereal invokes her divine authority to summon forth a sepulcher interred by the Heptarchs of Tragedy, seven gods of unpleasant truths and unhappy futures who bury knowledge of horrors not yet come to pass beneath the earth. The Sidereal spends three hours ritually invoking the Heptarchs of Tragedy; upon its completion, a sepulcher is unearthed by unseen forces and whisked to her, its door swinging open to reveal what is to come. The Sidereal’s player makes a special introduce fact roll to reveal what secret the sepulcher holds, introducing a fact relevant to the near future. She’s still dependent on her Lore backgrounds but treats them as though they represented the knowledge of a savant at the age’s end, however many decades or centuries hence that might be. The Sidereal banks any extra successes on this roll and can add them on rolls with any Ability that benefit from the introduced fact. If the game’s events ultimately contradict a fact about the future, this doesn’t mean the Sidereal was wrong, but that by the age’s end, a false narrative of events will have superseded the truth in the scholarly consensus.
