*The stylist moves in bursts of feral speed, outpacing and outmaneuvering her foes.*
The stylist gains the following benefits:  
- +1 Evasion  
- Crashing an enemy suffering a Minor disease increases it to Major.
- Diseased enemies suffer a penalty equal to their sickness’ intensity on rolls opposing the stylist’s disengage and [[Stealth]] rolls: −2 for Minor, −3 for Major, and −4 for Defining.
- She doesn’t lose [[Initiative]] from disengaging on a successful roll.
## Special activation rules
When the stylist’s [[Stealth]] roll to enter concealment beats the opposed rolls of all enemies, she may reflexively enter [[Rat Form]].
## Mastery
With [[Essence]] 3, the stylist can increase a crashed enemy’s Major diseases to Defining.
