*Huskflayer’s dark purpose is bloody revenge, and it turns all those slain or wounded by it to desperate flesh-puppets.*
## Resonant
Only characters resonant with [[Huskflayer]] can awaken this Evocation.
Huskflayer’s master can use this Evocation when she accomplishes a major character or story goal or a legendary social goal in pursuit of revenge against someone she has a negative Defining Tie for. She decrees a punishment for her nemesis, and uses those under Huskflayer’s control to enact it. She could have a corrupt prince put on trial and executed by his reanimated court, or condemn a rapacious warlord to being eaten alive by his army. This is similar to [[All Flesh Betrays]], applying to any mortal or trivial character wounded with [[Huskflayer]] or slain by it in pursuit of this vengeance, lasting until the task is complete.
The wielder’s thralls treat any social influence contrary to her decree as unacceptable. They add +4 dice on all rolls related to it, and +2 [[Defense]] and [[Resolve]] against the wielder’s nemesis. When narratively appropriate, the [[Storyteller]] may simply declare the punishment unfolds exactly as the wielder desires.
If the punishment is successfully completed, the wielder tastes grim satisfaction. She sets her temporary [[Willpower]] to 10, even if that’s higher than her permanent [[Willpower]], and she loses all [[Limit]].
## Reset 
Once per story.
## Awakening
This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience points. It awakens for free when the wielder learns that someone he has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward has been killed or suffers a similar loss, and forms a negative Defining Tie of hatred toward the person responsible.
