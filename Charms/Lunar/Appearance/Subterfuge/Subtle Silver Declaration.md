The Lunar conceals the marks of her divinity to better walk among humanity. While at dim anima, her Tell (p. XX) is perfectly concealed from characters who’ve never seen it before. Even magic can’t pierce this concealment, excepting Eye of the Unconquered Sun and comparable effects. Characters who’ve seen the Lunar’s Tell before can still roll to detect it, but their 1s subtract successes. At glowing anima, the Lunar’s Tell isn’t automatically revealed, instead requiring a roll to detect. If a character hasn’t seen the Lunar’s Tell, 1s subtract successes from his roll. With Appearance 4, Essence 4, 1s and 2s on rolls to detect the Lunar’s Tell at dim anima subtract successes. At glowing or above, characters that haven’t seen her Tell are likewise penalized by their 1s and 2s, while those who have seen it are penalized by 1s.
