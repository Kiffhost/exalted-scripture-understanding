In moments of vulnerability, [[Perdurant Vault]] conceals its wielder’s deepest beliefs from all prying minds — including her own. When a character penetrates the wielder’s [[Guile]] with a read intentions action, she may use this Evocation before any information is revealed to seal away one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] inside the City of Opal Unstained, a dream-realm within [[Perdurant Vault]]. That [[Intimacy]] is sealed away for ([[Willpower]]) days, during which it has no effect on the wielder. Hidden [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] manifest in the City of Opal Unstained as spirits of appropriate nature whose strength is based on their intensity: Minor [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] yield spirits only as strong as weak gods or First Circle Demons, while a Defining [[Intimacy]]’s spirit is comparable to a notable terrestrialgodorSecondCircleDemon.APrincipleoffaithin theImmaculatePhilosophymightmanifestasapious,ceremonially robed monk, whereas the [[Intimacy|Principle]] of “Creation must burn” might appear as a raging fire elemental. If the wielder enters the dream-realm via Traverse the Secret City, she can interact with her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], potentially learning some insight or nuance about her belief or destroying a spirit to remove the [[Intimacy]] entirely. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by successfully preventing the discovery of a Defining [[Intimacy]] whose revelation would have significant consequences for the wielder. 

## Resonant

A wielder who resonates with jade can activate this Evocation as if it were Simple, manifesting an [[Intimacy]] in the dream-realm at will rather than in response to social influence. Such uses don’t require this Evocation to be reset.
