The Lawgiver’s knowledge of the past and her understandingofphysicallawsallowshertomakenigh-flawlessgeneral predictions. To use this Charm, the Exalt must spend a day studyingasubjectfromanauthoritativeordefinitivesource. Her player may then make a pronouncement against an ongoing project based on knowledge her studies reveal, creating bonuses for those who act in accordance with her accuratepredictions,andpenaltiesforthosewhogoagainst them. For example, after reading about the patterns of weather, hostile elemental activity and famine in Jiara during the summer months over the last thousand years, shepredictsthatMnemonwillnotattackJiaranrebelsuntil fall at the earliest, and will instead spend the summer months consolidating her forces while conserving water andgatheringresourcesforawintercampaign.IfMnemon enacts a project to consolidate her forces while gathering resourcesuntilwinter,theStorytellershouldconsiderMnemon’sprojectvastlymoresuccessfulandeasiertocomplete thanotherwise.IfMnemoninsteaddecidestoinvadeJiaran rebelterritoryinthesummer,herinvasionwillbemetwith project difficulties, such as resource shortages, elemental attacks,inclementweather,andmorespecifically,mechanical penalties to the first [[War]] rolls her generals make in the conflict. Conversely, if Mnemon harbors her forces and the Jiaran rebels instead try to attack her, it is their commanders who will suffer penalties to their opening [[War]] rolls. Once the Solar has made a prediction, it may not be canceledwithaconflictinguseofthisorsimilarCharms,though it may be counteracted with Sidereal Astrology or similar powerful fate-bending magic. Though this Charm has an instant duration, the motes spent activating it are committed until the Exalt has had a full night’s rest.
