The Dragon-Blood attunes herself to the vibrations and [[Essence]] that pass through the earth, sensing the marches of distant legions or a behemoth’s footfalls.
When she uses [[Feeling the Dragon’s Bones]], she detects the movement of battle groups, Legendary [[Size]] characters, or anything similarly large moving across the earth within (successes rolled) miles. She can’t pinpoint their precise location, but has a general sense of distance and direction, doubling 8s on [[Survival]] rolls to navigate toward or away from them.
If the Dragon-Blood knows [[Sense the Hidden Ember]], she also detects the presence within this range of any trace of magic that Charm is capable of sensing, as above.
