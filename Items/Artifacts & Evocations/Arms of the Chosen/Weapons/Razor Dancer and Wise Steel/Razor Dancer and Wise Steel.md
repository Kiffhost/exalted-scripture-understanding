The heroes Adalin Razor-Dancer and Seren of the Wise Steel met in the Northern city of Plenilune. Adalin had come to slay the Nine Red Chainers syndicate and burn their blood-money empire to the ground; Seren had infiltrated the syndicate to destroy it from within. At first at cross-purposes, they dueled, squabbled, then joined forces to annihilate the slaver enterprise. They also fell in love. Together they set out to scourge all tyranny and wickedness from the Saltspires and the surrounding lands. The witch-queen of the waste, clad in her raiment of tears, witnessed their deeds in her frozen scrying pool. Contemptuous of their love, she lured them to her tower of crimson ice, where she tested their affections, their trust, and their skill at arms. In the end they passed every test but the last, perishing with their bond unbroken. Lauding them with mockery, the witch bound their souls and forged them into a pair of blades. There, she said, they could fight at one another’s side until time’s end. The soulsteel blades are paired but not identical; Razor Dancer is longer and balanced for striking, while Wise Steel’s heft and breadth make it superior for defense. The tortured images of the two heroes can be dimly seen in their black surfaces as through a broken mirror. Drawn as one in battle, their moaning becomes a haunting duet of regret and aspiration. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of Razor

Dancer and Wise Steel In hammering each soul upon her anvil, the witch-queen condensed a lifetime of instinct and combat skill into a single pattern. In achieving harmony with a blade, the wielder may assume the dead hero’s fighting style as her own. This functions as a martial arts form (Exalted, pp. 426-427). These [[Evocations]] can be employed in combination with any martial arts style compatible with paired [[short daiklaves]], and are compatible with light or medium armor; they cannot be activated while in heavy armor. An Exalt who wields both daiklaves adds a bonus die on clash attacks. Less than a year old, the blades have only been wielded brieflybyoneofthewitch’shandmaidens.Assuch,they’ve yettodevelopafullsuiteofEvocations.Anewwieldermay awaken their powers further.
