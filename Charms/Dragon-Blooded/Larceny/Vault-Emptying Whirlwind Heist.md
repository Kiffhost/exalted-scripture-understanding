The Dragon-Blood’s foresight envisions countless possible scenarios that might occur in a crime, planning out contingencies and countermeasures for any obstacle that she can conceive. Invoking this Charm requires spending an hour casing the site of a planned heist, planning out the steps of a crime, consulting with various criminal allies, or other activities taken in preparation of a crime. She rolls (Intelligence + Larceny), banking all rolled successes. To access the banked successes, the Dragon-Blood must begin the planned crime. She may add some or all of the banked successes as a Charm bonus on any rolls that she or another character present in the scene makes with Larceny, Investigation, Lore, or Stealth to advance the crime. Additionally, she may expend banked successes to gain the following effects: 1 Success Retroactively leave her calling card, mark, or sign in a dramatic location. 2 Successes Waive the anima cost of Evidence-Erasing Tide. 5 Successes Waive the Willpower cost of Instant Disguise Prana. 7 Successes Invoke Investigation-Deflecting Current (if she knows it) retroactively to conceal evidence of an act she’s already committed in the course of the crime. Vault-Emptying Whirlwind Heist can only be used once per story, unless reset by successfully upholding a Major or Defining Intimacy as the result of a successful crime. This can either be direct, such as stealing a jewel the Exalt has a Tie of avarice towards, or indirect, such as fencing a jewel in order to feed a community of urchins she has a Tie of compassion for.
