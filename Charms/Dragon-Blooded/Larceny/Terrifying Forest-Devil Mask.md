*The Dragon-Blood dons a mask and vanishes into a world of legends and devils, taking up a disguise embodying an archetypal warrior-hero, monster, or mythic character.*
Most Dynasts create ornate ritual masks from wood by hand, shaping their persona as they carve it, but any mask suffices on short notice if it suitably evokes the persona’s image. She rolls to create a disguise with double 7s. Her persona must be either a fictitious identity or archetypal role — such as an Immaculate Dragon, a hero or villain out of folklore, a legendary figure of the Shogunate, or a figure invented out of whole cloth. Her disguise only serves to conceal her identity, not to impersonate specific characters. She divides ([[Essence]]) temporary specialties that fit her persona among any of her Abilities for as long as she remains in disguise. Upon donning the mask, the Dragon-Blood accepts a Defining [[Intimacy]] that suits her role, such as “Those who abuse their power must be humbled” or “Destroy all Anathema.” As long as she remains in disguise, this [[Intimacy]] cannot be weakened or changed by any means. Onlookers who fail to beat her disguise roll will react to her as though they had a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]], with a context appropriate to her persona and the circumstances. A folk hero might inspire gratitude among the peasants she fights for while drawing the ire of princes and their minions; a horrible devil inspires sheer terror in all who look upon it. In combat, an enemy may attempt to strike away the Dragon-Blood’s mask as a difficulty 6 gambit. Success ends this Charm.
