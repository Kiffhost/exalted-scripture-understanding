*Following the utterance of impossible syllables, the earth ruptures around the necromancer into a whirlwind of shattered bones and ribbons of rotten flesh.*
The whirlwind provides light cover against attacks on the necromancer and any allies within close range.
Enemies attempting to attack the necromancer from close range must dodge the lethal fragments of flesh and bone whirling through the air, a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 3, Damage 2L.
The storm gathers the flesh and bone of the dead that lies in the necromancer’s path, tearing them to pieces and adding to its mass. More than a dozen corpses intensify the whirlwind into a deadlier hurricane: it provides heavy cover against ranged attacks and increases both the difficulty and the damage of the environmental hazard by the ([[Size]]) of the corpses fed into it, up to a maximum of difficulty 5, Damage 7L. The hurricane grows faster as it’s fed, obscuring the necromancer from sight and inflicting a −2 penalty on [[Perception]]-based rolls to locate her amidst the chaos.
This spell ends if the necromancer is crashed or incapacitated.
## Control
As a miscellaneous action, the necromancer may tear nearby corpses into piles of gore with a wave of her hand, compacting them into crude and dense structures within short range. Corpse-barriers provide medium cover and require a [[Strength]] 3+ feat of demolition at difficulty 3 to break through when made into an obstacle. Gore carries an unusual appeal to the necromancer, drawing her to inspect viscera whenever she chances upon it.
## Distortion (10)
Distortion prevents the whirlwind from intensifying into a hurricane or weakens it if it already has.
