*The martial artist’s stance, breathing, footwork, and Essence embody the magical materials, transforming her into a living artifact.*
The stylist gains the following benefits
- Her unarmed attacks gain artifact traits (Accuracy +5, Damage +10B/3).
- She reduces the cost of this Charm’s prerequisites by two motes.
- She’s immune to crippling effects and ignores crippling penalties.
- She can use Evocations she’s awakened from a jade, orichalcum, moonsilver, or starmetal artifact without needing that artifact, letting her use weapon Evocations through unarmed attacks.
She can’t use Evocations whose effect requires the artifact.
### Enlightenment
The stylist becomes resonant with jade, moonsilver, orichalcum, and starmetal.
## Special activation rules
The stylist can reflexively enter this Form when she uses all four of its prerequisite Charms in a round.
