The Sidereal presents an idealized image of herself for suitors to obsess over, blinding them to the truth. When the Sidereal successfully asserts her Evasion or [[Guile]], she can use this Charm to reflexively roll ([[Appearance]] + [[Dodge]]) to enter concealment. Enemies whose [[Resolve]] is lower than her [[Appearance]] suffer a penalty on opposed rolls equal to the difference. If she uses this concealment to ambush her attacker, she applies a free full Excellency on her [[Join Battle]] roll. If the Sidereal uses this Charm together with [[Elusive Object of Desire]], she makes one roll for both. If she successfully establishes concealment against her attacker, he can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist that Charm’s instill roll or subsequent effects unless she enters a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and cites an [[Intimacy]] equal or greater than his [[Intimacy|Tie]] of infatuation to her.
