# Solar 

Below are a number of potential Limit Triggers. This list is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive—players should feel free to design their own Limit Trigger (with the Storyteller’s approval). A Limit Trigger should be a situation that the character finds stressful, traumatic, or frustrating.
- The Solar is insulted, belittled, or deliberately frustrated by another character.
- The Solar tells a lie, deliberately deceives someone, or breaks a sworn oath.
- The Solar sees innocents suffering, and is either unable or unwilling to help them.
- The Solar is hindered or defeated by the self-indulgent and intemperate behavior of those around him.
- The Solar’s allies suffer a setback or defeat because of a mistake he made.
- The Solar is faced with the opportunity to advance his own cause by harming an innocent or ignoring one’s suffering.
- The Solar’s emotions lead him into a course of action that he regrets.
- The Solar is denied a favorite pleasure or vice, either by circumstance, another character, or his own decisions.

# Lunar

A character’s Limit trigger is an especially stressful, frustrating, or traumatic situation. Lunar Limit triggers often relate to their rage — things that rouse the Lunar’s anger, or a consequence of rage. Sample Limit triggers include: 
- The Lunar destroys, abandons, or sacrifices something valuable to her.
- Someone insults or deliberately frustrates the Lunar. 
- The Lunar discovers a significant obstacle in the way of one of her or her Circle’s goals when success seemed almost certain. 
- The Lunar offers advice or wisdom but is not heeded. 
- The immorality or transgressions of others hinder the Lunar. 
- The Lunar drives away someone for whom she cares. 
- An adversary exploits the Lunar’s mercy or compassion. 
- The Lunar must endure deprivation, poverty, or extreme physical hardship due to an adversary, or to achieve one of her or her Circle’s goals. 
- Someone the Lunar wishes would pay attention to her rejects, humiliates, or ignores her.

# Sidereal

Sidereal Limit Triggers are usually situations that cause them to feel excessive pride or self-confidence, drive them to double down on troubled plans, or succumb to skewed priorities or a self-centered perspective. Examples include: 
- The Sidereal succeeds despite overwhelming odds or having been discouraged by others. 
- Someone the Sidereal has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward suffers a significant failure or setback because they ignored her advice. 
- The Sidereal is hindered by the failures or mistakes of allies, subordinates, or superiors. 
- The Sidereal is praised by someone for whom she has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]]. 
- The Sidereal suffers a significant failure or setback. 
- An unforeseen enemy or complication poses an obstacle to the Sidereal’s plans. 
- Serious difference of opinion or competing goals strain the Sidereal’s relationship with an ally, subordinate, or superior. 
- Someone the Sidereal has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward faces significant danger or distress.
