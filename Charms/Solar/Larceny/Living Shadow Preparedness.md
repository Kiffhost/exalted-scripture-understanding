*The Solar becomes the light which swallows the shadow.*
The player rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Larceny]]), doubles and banks any successes. Banked successes can be reflexively applied to a single [[Larceny]] or [[Stealth]] action. This effect lasts until the Exalt sleeps, and can be renewed only once per day.
