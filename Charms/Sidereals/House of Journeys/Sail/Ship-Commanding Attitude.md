*The Sidereal radiates intimidating charisma, commanding the obedience of her crew and the surrender of her foes.*
The Sidereal’s bargain, persuade, and threaten rolls treat her targets’ negative Ties toward her as one step lower in intensity. Characters who work under her command are treated as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to her.
