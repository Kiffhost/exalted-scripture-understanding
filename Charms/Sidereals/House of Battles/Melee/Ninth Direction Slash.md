Sensing an unexpected angle of attack, the Sidereal strikes along the path that leads past her enemy’s guard. When the Sidereal makes an attack that benefits from aiming or makes a counterattack or clash while benefitting from a full defense, she rolls (Perception + Melee) opposing her enemy’s (Wits + combat Ability) roll. If she succeeds, her attack becomes an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). Reset: Once per scene unless reset by incapaciting an enemy with an attack that benefitted from aiming or a counterattack or clash while using a full defense.
