Needles are the ultimate in subtle assassination instruments. These tiny spikes are as long as a small finger and as wide as a housecatâ€™s fang. They can be thrown with the flick of a finger or even held in the mouth and spat at a target. While they inflict very little damage, most assassins will equip their needles with poison. Using a blowgun to propel needles extends their range to Thrown (Medium).
