*The Sidereal acts in perfect balance with the cosmos, bringing the world around her into alignment with her victory.*
The stylist gains the following benefits
- She adds +2 effective Essence, maximum 10, for magic that uses Essence ratings in calculations (but not for any other purpose).
- Once per round, she may reduce the Willpower cost of Astrology Interruption Method, Essence Redirection Technique, Sequential Essence Disruption, or Spell-Shattering Palm by one.
- When she would gain Initiative, she may exchange some or all of it for that many motes, maximum (Lore + Occult) motes per round. She can’t do so when resetting Initiative.
- When paying Willpower, she may spend five motes in place of a point of Willpower once per round.
### Enlightenment
In combat, the stylist gains (Essence/2, rounded up) Initiative when she successfully negates an effect with Astrology Interruption Method, Essence Redirection Technique, Sequential Essence Disruption, or Spell-Shattering Palm, maximum once per round.
## Special activation rules
The stylist can reflexively enter this Form when she goes from dim anima to bonfire in a single instant.
