Ghostly possession is feared in cultures throughout [[Creation]], a subversion of the natural order as the dead claw into the hearts and minds of the living. Few but storied are the occultists and mediums who learn to open themselves to possession in communion with the departed. Whether she channels the wisdom of a favored ancestor or makes herself a prison for an abhorrent wraith, the medium cannot help but be changed over the course of years of possession. In partnership or opposition, she makes ghosts’ memories her own and becomes one of the few living souls to know what death feels like before her time — a sensation that opens her mind to the enlightenment of the grave.
