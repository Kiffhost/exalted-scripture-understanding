Locks and walls aren’t enough to stymie the prying curiosity of a Dragon-Blooded thief. She may peer through an obstruction as though it were pellucid water, spying through solid walls or examining the contents of a chest before risking its trapped lock. This is a (Perception + Larceny) roll against a difficulty based on the material and thickness of the obstacle she attempts to see through. For example, a wooden door or chest is difficulty 1; a stone wall or metal vault would be difficulty 3; a manse’s walls, an artifact container, or the heavy stone walls of a fortress are difficulty 5+. Barriers more than (Essence + Perception) feet thick can’t be seen through. A successful roll causes a small portion of the obstruction, up to (Essence) square feet, to appear totally translucent to the Exalt (but not to anyone else). Each use of this Charm lasts a single round, or around ten seconds out of combat. If the Dragon-Blood wishes to renew this Charm at the end of that duration, she doesn’t need to pay its Willpower cost or make another roll. While using this Charm, the Exalt may reflexively activate Mischievous Wind Grasp, waiving its Willpower cost, to send a current of wind through the barrier as though it weren’t there.
