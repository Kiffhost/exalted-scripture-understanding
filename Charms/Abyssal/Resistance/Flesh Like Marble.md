*The Abyssal’s flesh fades bloodlessly pale as she suffuses her body with death’s [[Essence]].*
The Abyssal rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) with (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) automatic successes, which can’t be enhanced by other magic. While unarmored, she adds her successes to her soak and gains ([[Stamina]]) [[Hardness]]. She can use this [[Hardness]] against [[environmental hazards]].
