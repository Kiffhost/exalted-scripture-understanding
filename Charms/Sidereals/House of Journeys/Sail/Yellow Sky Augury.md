*The Sidereal tugs at the strands of fate like a leadsman’s chains, judging the depth of perils a journey holds.*
Contemplating a proposed route, the Sidereal rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Sail]]). The Storyteller should give her player a description of how dangerous a journey along it would be, predicting danger that would occur within a number of hours equal to the Sidereal’s successes. She doesn’t learn the precise form this danger takes: she might discern that a path would pose little danger to her but would threaten the life of her mortal companions, but she wouldn’t learn if that danger is from harsh weather, wild beasts, bandits, or a traitor among her own traveling companions. If the Sidereal uses this Charm to evaluate multiple routes and chooses to take a particularly dangerous option, successfully completing her journey counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX).
