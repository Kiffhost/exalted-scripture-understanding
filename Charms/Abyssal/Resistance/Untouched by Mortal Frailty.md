*Having cast her mortality aside, Death’s Lawgiver scoffs at plague and poison.*
The Abyssal rerolls 1s until they cease to appear on rolls against disease and poison. She’s immune to any such ailment that she’s previously been exposed to.
With Stamina 3, the morbidity of a disease the Abyssal is exposed to can’t exceed 5 — even for diseases that wouldn’t normally allow a morbidity roll.
