*When the monster gives chase, retreat becomes an exercise in futility.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have Initiative 6+. She makes a withering or decisive attack against an enemy within medium range, using her movement action to charge into close range with him before she strikes. She can’t move vertically as part of this. She adds one die of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage based on the distance she crosses: one die against enemies at close range, two dice at short range, or three dice at medium range.

If she deals 5+ withering damage or any decisive damage, her target is knocked back one range band. If it was a smash attack, she instead adds an additional success on the damage roll. The same is true if she uses [[Fists of the Old Ones]] with this Charm.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Joyful Cessation of Restraint]] reflexively instead of making an attack with this Charm normally. Doing so gives up this Charm’s damage bonus.
### Keys
#### Leaping Smash Technique
The Infernal can leap vertically upward or downward for some or all of this Charm’s movement, and doesn’t take damage from falling after the attack. If she crashes an airborne enemy or deals 3+ decisive damage, he falls to the ground. Even if he only fell from close range, he suffers damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232).
#### Nowhere to Hide ([[#Leaping Smash Technique]])
If the Infernal hits an enemy, she tastes his fear. For the rest of the scene, she can use [[Raging Behemoth Charge]] to attack him even if he’s in concealment or otherwise obscured from her, driven by instinct and blind aggression to strike as long as he’s within this Charm’s range.
#### Nowhere to Run (Essence 3, [[#Nowhere to Hide ( Leaping Smash Technique )|Nowhere to Hide]]) (+2m)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote surcharge to attack an enemy at long range, adding four bonus damage dice.
