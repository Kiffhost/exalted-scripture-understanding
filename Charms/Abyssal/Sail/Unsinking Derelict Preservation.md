*Filling her ship with a measure of her own unholy resilience, the deathknight preserves it against damage.*
The Abyssal negates all [[Hull]] damage that would be dealt to a ship by an attack, naval hazard, or similar peril. This protection extends out to short range from the Abyssal — if a threat specifically targets a portion of the ship outside of the area, this Charm can’t be used against it. If an area-of-effect attack or similar threat extends beyond the protected zone, this Charm offers diminished protection, halving the [[Hull]] damage dealt to the ship, rounded up.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm multiple times in the same scene against a single peril that causes recurring damage, she waives the [[Willpower]] cost of uses past the first.
With [[Essence]] 3, this Charm’s range extends to medium.
