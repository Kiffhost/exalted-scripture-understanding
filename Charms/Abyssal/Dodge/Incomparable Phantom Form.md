*Suffusing her body with spectral [[Essence]], the Abyssal becomes translucent and insubstantial.*
When defending against an attack, the Abyssal may spend [[Initiative]] as if it were motes on the [[Dodge]] Excellency against it. Doing so adds ([[Essence]]) to the maximum bonus she can add to [[Defense|Evasion]] with [[Charms]].
While using [[Untouchable Phantom Mien]] (p. XX), each point of [[Initiative]] spent on the [[Dodge]] Excellency counts as two motes.
With [[Dodge]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the deathknight gains one mote when she dodges an attack with this Charm, maximum once per round.
