This stone is a rich reddish-brown, with a surface that feels like soft, furry bark, and grants its bearer the agility and balance of its namesake. When socketed into armor, it negates the armorâ€™s mobility penalty for the purpose of climbing, leaping, or other acrobatic or arboreal actions, though not movement actions on relatively flat ground.
If the armor has no mobility penalty, then the Exalt instead gains one automatic success on all rolls to climb, leap, swing, and perform other acrobatic or arboreal actions.
Finally, the character never treats tree branches, limbs, crumbling ramparts, or other elevated and treacherous ground as difficult terrain.
