A fiery nimbus of anima engulfs the Dragon-Blood, burning with the radiance of her own peerless self-confidence. After paying this Charm’s cost, she rolls (current temporary Willpower), gaining a temporary −0 health level for each success, and adds (Charisma) to her natural soak. Once this Charm ends, these temporary health levels fade, and all levels of damage contained in them shift back into the Dragon-Blood’s damage track. If this incapacitates her, she falls unconscious, even if lethally damaged, instead of being left dead or dying.
