The Sidereal veils herself in the subtlety of the unseen forces she has mastered. The Sidereal gains +1 Resolve and Guile until her next turn when she takes a Shape Sorcery action. She doesnâ€™t lose sorcerous motes for going a turn without gathering them. While wearing the resplendent destiny of an Exalt, other supernatural being, sorcerer, or mysterious sage, this Charm is free.
