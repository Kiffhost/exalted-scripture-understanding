*The Abyssal’s blow unleashes a maelstrom of spiritual pressure, sending her victim flying.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after making a decisive damage roll. As long as she rolls at least one success, her enemy is knocked prone and loses one Initiative, which she gains after resetting to base. With more successes, she can strike with even greater force
- With 3+ success, she can knock her victim into an object or surface within close range to inflict damage per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232), destroying flimsy objects like thin wooden walls.
- With 4+ successes, she can strike him into an object or surface at close range with enough force to inflict damage per a medium-range fall and leave cracks in thick stone walls, or knock him to short range, inflicting damage per a short-range fall.
- With 5+ successes, she can knock an enemy to short range and inflict damage per a medium-range fall.
With Essence 3, the Abyssal doubles her successes on the damage roll for the purpose of determining how far she can fling her enemies. With 7+ successes, she can knock an enemy out to medium range and inflict damage per a medium-range fall.
