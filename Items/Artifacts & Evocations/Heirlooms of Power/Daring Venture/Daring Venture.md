When V’neef was a girl, still considering what manner of life she’d lead, the hills and forests of the Dragon’s Blanket offered novelty that her studies couldn’t. To her tutors’ consternation, V’neef would disappear for days on end, returning from her wanderings soiled, smiling, and animated with some discovery. Her father recognized this curiosity as the seed of wisdom, and commissioned Daring Venture for V’neef’s 14th birthday to accompany her in her travels. In her 17th year, while journeying with Daring Venture, V’neef discovered a great wolf, grown giant through some lost First Age magic, wounded by a hunter’s lance. Though it snarled and snapped at her, she calmed it with notes plucked from Daring Venture’s bowstring and tended to its wounds, winning the beast’s affections. She named the wolf [[HUNDRED RIVERS, THE WANDERING WOLF|Hundred Rivers]], and his legend has been intertwined with Daring Venture’s ever since. Daring Venture is a tall, slender powerbow of opaque emerald jade. Etchings depict scenes of wild splendor — waterfalls, pine forests, sunrises — whose details change to reflect its wielder’s recent journeys. Daring Venture yearns to traverse the wilderness, callings its wielder to explore new vistas at the edges of Creation’s maps. Its Evocations embolden the wielder with wood’s dynamism, rewarding discovery with flowerings of inspiration, and summon Hundred Rivers to its master’s aid. As matriarch of her house, V’neef has little time for the adventures of her youth, though she still enjoys the occasional escapade. She grants Daring Venture to scions with kindred spirits, charging them to go forth and discover House V’neef’s shining future.
