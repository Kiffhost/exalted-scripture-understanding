Strength represents a character’s raw physical power, the sheer might of what he can achieve by muscle alone. In combat, Strength helps determine the [[Attack#raw damage|damage]] a character can deal with his [[Attack#withering|withering attacks]], as well as how well he [[Grappling|grapples]] foes. It’s also used when a character wishes to [[Feats of Strength|lift, break, or heave]] any objects or obstacles that might stand in his way.
