*The Infernal strikes down those who would chase or chain her, leaving them to contemplate the price of their folly.*

The Infernal adds a non-Charm die on an attack roll made from short range, or a non-Charm success on an attack from medium range or further. If she attacks an enemy who successfully rushed her on her last turn, she counts as being one range band further away to determine this Charm’s bonus. She gains the same benefit against enemies who are actively restraining her, or who are blocking the only exit from a confined space.
