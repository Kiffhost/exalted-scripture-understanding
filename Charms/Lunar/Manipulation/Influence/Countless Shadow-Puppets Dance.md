*Weaving stolen faces into a tapestry of mystery and rumor, the Lunar inhabits the stage of others’ assumptions.*
When she uses [[The Shadow Who Wasn’t There]] or [[Ever-Present Shadow Insinuation]], she’s no longer limited to making her targets believe that she or her current human shape either was or was not the unknown individual in question. She can cause their assumption to fall on any human whose shape she possesses, without needing to wear it. Note that using those two [[Charms]] together only produces cognitive dissonance if they create conflicting certainties — e.g., if the Lunar induces the belief that a mysterious serial killer is the satrap’s advisor and isn’t the Lunar, no penalty results. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as an [[Appearance]] Charm.
