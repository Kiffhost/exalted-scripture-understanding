The fervent force of the Sidereal’s personality overcomes boundaries of individuality, leaving an impression of her Essence on someone’s unconscious mind. The Sidereal chooses an influence roll she wishes her target to make and the circumstances under which she makes it. She can’t choose conditions her target wouldn’t be aware of — “five days from now” or “the next time you see your brother” would be valid, but not “when someone nearby plans to betray you.” The Sidereal rolls for this influence against her target’s Resolve, unmodified by Intimacies, to embed that influence within his mind. She can’t enhance it with non-Excellency Charms. If she succeeds, once the condition is met, the target inadvertently makes the chosen influence, using her successes. The target isn’t aware of making the influence; it’s conveyed unconsciously through the subtext and connotations of his words or actions. If making this influence opposes one of the target’s Major or Defining Intimacies, he can pay one Willpower to resist. This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived against characters with one of the Sidereal’s Intimacies from Impose Nature.
