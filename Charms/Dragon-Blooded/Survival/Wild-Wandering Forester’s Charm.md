The Dragon-Blood knows the wilderness as well as she knows her own domain, aware of the secrets and wonders hidden within it. She rolls ([Intelligence or Wits] + [[Survival]]) to introduce a fact (Exalted, p. 237) about a wilderness region that sheâ€™s familiar with. She might recount her knowledge of an animal species native to the region, the location of a rare medicinal herb, or effective preparations against a hazard she might encounter.
