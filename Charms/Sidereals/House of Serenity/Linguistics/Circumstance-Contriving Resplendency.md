While wearing a resplendent destiny, the Sidereal can use Equitable Partnership to draw a variety of Merits appropriate to its destiny and role into her life instead of a single powerful backer. If she wears the associated constellation’s trappings, she gains +1 die from exceptional equipment. She can choose any of the Allies, Backing, Command, Contacts, Cult, Followers, Influence, Mentor, Resources, or Retainers Merits that fit the destiny. Fate brings them into her lives as quickly as necessary to ensure she benefits from them.
