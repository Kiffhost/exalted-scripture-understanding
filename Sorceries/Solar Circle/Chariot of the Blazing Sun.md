*A helix of light flies from the sorcerer’s hands towards the sun, cohering into reins that draw down rays of sunlight, transforming them into powerful steeds.*

The sorcerer conjures a chariot and five horses made of sun-coloured flame, capable of carrying herself and up to five passengers (or equivalent cargo) for as long as a sun hangs in the sky. When cast it Malfeas, the chariot is formed from emerald sunfire instead. Once laden, this chariot takes off into the sky, following an arc towards any destination the sorcerer desires. The sorcerer sets its course, meaning that the precise location of her landing relies on her knowledge and navigation. The chariot can’t veer from the chosen course, though it can maneuver in mid-air as needed. The chariot is bright enough to be seen from the ground even during the day, though it flies several miles high.

The chariot can travel from one end of Creation to the other in a single day if she casts the spell at sunrise, and moves at approximately 750 miles per hour for shorter journeys. The sorcerer must concentrate on holding the reins to maintain this spell, unable to perform any non-reflexive actions, though she can still engage in casual conversation and other activities that don’t require a roll. The chariot isn’t limited to mere flight. It can travel from Creation to Heaven, or vice versa, over the course of an hour. In Malfeas, it can move from one layer to any other by flying towards the Green Sun itself.

The chariot is inured to the perils of travel through the sky, including environmental hazards, environmental Shaping effects, and the like. Hurricane winds and lightning alike rebound off its fiery corona, the Wyld’s chaos-wind evaporates into harmless shimmers, and even the Silent Wind of Hell falters against the green flame. The guardians of Creation’s firmament and Heaven’s skies recognize the chariot as holding authority to pass through their domains, but demons and the denizens of stranger skies have no such automatic regard.

While few assailants can keep up with the chariot, those who do find it nigh-impervious. The chariot’s corona is an environmental hazard that extends out to close range from it with difficulty 7 that deals three levels of aggravated damage per round. The sorcerer and her chosen passengers aren’t affected by this. Those aboard the chariot have heavy cover against attacks from without. Ranged attacks are burnt away by the chariot’s corona before they can hit unless they use projectiles that are artifacts or otherwise supernatural in nature, or don’t use a physical projectile. Spells of the First or Second Circles can’t affect the chariot or anything within.

This spell ends once the chariot lands. If the sun sets while it’s still in transit, the chariot gently descends to the ground before fading. Should some power take the sun from the sky or turn the day to night, the chariot instead disintegrates, leaving the passengers to contend with a fall from extreme height (Exalted, p. 232). This renders the spell unreliable in most regions of the Underworld, where suns are rare, temperamental, and inconstant.
# Control
Birds, air elementals, devil-stars, and all things that dwell in the sky perceive the sorcerer as an
authority and count as having a Minor Tie of deference to her. The sorcerer may act normally while piloting the chariot, though she must still keep a hand on the reins and cannot cast spells.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 30)
The distorting sorcerer causes the chariot to veer 10 miles off-course in a direction of his choice, plus another 10 miles for each extra success above the goal number on his final distortion roll.
