*The Infernal knows those she studies better than they know themselves. She knows why they deserve her love, and why they deserve her hate.*

The Infernal rerolls 5s and 6s until they cease to appear on a read intentions roll. If she succeeds, she forms a Minor Tie toward her target, with a context chosen by her player. She can’t spend Willpower to resist this and can’t voluntarily weaken the Intimacy for the rest of the session. If she already has a positive Tie toward the target, the new one must have a negative context, and vice versa.

If the Infernal has both a positive and a negative Tie toward the target, she strengthens the weaker of the two by one step before rolling, instead of forming a new Tie if she succeeds. She then adds the strengthened Tie’s (Intimacy) dice on the roll. If both are Defining, she adds an additional die.
