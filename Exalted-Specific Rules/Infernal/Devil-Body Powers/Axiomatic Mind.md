The Infernal’s mind is reshaped by her transformation, whether she becomes an unfeeling god-machine or an abstract congeries of arcane mathematics and tonal sorcery. She’s immune to social influence based on emotion. Her Major and Defining Intimacies can’t be weakened or altered by any means, nor can new Intimacies be raised to Major or Defining intensity.
