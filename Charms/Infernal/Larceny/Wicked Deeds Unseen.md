*The Infernal keeps her crimes hidden until the time is right to expose them.*

The Infernal adds a non-Charm die on a conceal evidence roll, plus an additional die for each condition that applies:
- She’s concealing evidence of her own misdeeds.
- She’s concealing evidence of a crime.
- She’s concealing evidence of an act that would be considered morally wrong within the community where it was committed.
- She’s in total darkness or it’s night.
## [[Keys]]
#### Shadow Play Charade (Larceny 3) (+1m-4m)
The Infernal can arrange the scene so that it suggests a false cause or culprit for a surcharge of four motes, minus one mote for each condition she meets. She can choose any false result that’s plausible for the evidence available, but can’t dictate specific details: the angle of a wound could be made to implicate a garrison soldier’s sword, but not to frame a specific soldier. An investigator who fails his case scene roll believes he’s succeeded, but receives a clue that points him towards the false cause.
#### Guilt Cast Aside (Larceny 4, Essence 2) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay an additional one-Willpower surcharge to convert the added dice to non-Charm successes. If she uses this key with [[#Shadow Play Charade (Larceny 3) (+1m-4m)|Shadow Play Charade]], even successful Investigation rolls turn up the false clue she plants in addition to the actual evidence. The investigator is aware of the discrepancy, but not of which piece of evidence is genuine.
#### Your Little Problem (Larceny 5, Essence 2, [[#Shadow Play Charade (Larceny 3) (+1m-4m)|Shadow Play Charade]]) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay an additional one-Willpower surcharge when she uses [[#Shadow Play Charade (Larceny 3) (+1m-4m)|Shadow Play Charade]] to make it seem as if a specific character committed the concealed act, or some equally detailed cause. This key’s surcharge is waived if she uses it together with [[#Guilt Cast Aside (Larceny 4, Essence 2) (+1wp)|Guilt Cast Aside]].
