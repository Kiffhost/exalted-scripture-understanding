The stylists circle walks in a pattern that seems to defy geometry, trailing echoes of her past and future selves as she traces out the shape that Jehu Khoor witnessed in the depths of time. The stylist gains the following benefits: 
-  She may pay one Willpower to flurry two Simple Martial Arts Charms, or Charms that are compatible with martial arts attacks. If she flurries two Simple Charms that both let her make attacks, she can combine their effects in a single attack as long as they aren’t incompatible in any way. (This doesn’t apply to Charms that let her make multiple attacks or area-of-effect attacks). 
-  She ignores all penalties from flurries that include at least one Lore or Martial Arts action. 
-  Her attacks add dice equal to her target's onslaught penalty. If this exceeds her dice limit, the excess is added as dice of decisive or post-soaking withering damage 
-  Her enemies’ onslaught penalties apply on movement actions opposed by her. 

## Special activation rules

When the stylist increases an enemy’s onslaught penalty to −4 or higher, she may reflexively enter this Form. The Scripture of Eternity One day, there’ll be a maiden... Who’ll slips free of Time’s clutches and stand outside eternity. But try as she might, she won’t be able to escape her memories or her hopes for the future. Perceiving the nature of her prison, She’ll see how many times she’ll escaped and how many times she failed. “Do you understand now?” asked Time, “There is no end and no beginning.”
