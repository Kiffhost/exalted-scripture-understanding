*Those destined to die are no different than corpses in the Sidereal’s eyes.  Once the Sidereal or another character has used Auspicious Prospects for Endings to determine someone’s destined to die, he counts as undead for her magic if that’s advantageous for her. If this doesn’t make sense for certain effects, like Soul-Reviving Eulogy (p. 312), the Storyteller should adjust it as appropriate. This also applies to characters she’s cursed with Descending Endings Horoscope, Tears of the Blade, or a prophecy meant to kill them. Abyssals also count as undead for her even when it’s disadvantageous.*
With a repurchase, this effect extends to all enemies of fate.
