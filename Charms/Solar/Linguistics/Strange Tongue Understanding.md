*Tuning [[Essence]] through her language centers, the Exalt reconciles a character’s vocal tone, inflection, and gestures into a clear statement of intent.*
This allows her to accurately interpret statements made in languages she doesn’t know. As the Solar’s concentration congeals into a moment of perfect clarity, she must evaluate each statement separately. Each activation of this Charm allows her to understand three or four simple sentences or one long, complex sentence. The Solar may also use this Charm to reflexively lower the [[Guile]] of a speaker using abstruse language to conceal an issue or artificially inflate the importance of a topic, reducing his [[Guile]] by one.
