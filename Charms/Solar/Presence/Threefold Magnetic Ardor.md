The Solar’s intense sexuality magnifies her powers of persuasion, making any instill or persuade actions made with [[Presence]], [[Performance]] or [[Socialize]] more compelling. Normally when a character has higher [[Appearance]] than her target’s [[Resolve]], she enjoys a non-Charm dice bonus equal to the difference of the two values. This Charm converts the difference into automatic successes. This bonus counts as dice added by a Charm. Note that this Charm still works if the character has the [[Hideous]] merit, as the amplification of her horrifying [[Appearance]] has an equally profound effect on persuasion. In this case, [[Threefold Magnetic Ardor]] also supplements threaten actions.
