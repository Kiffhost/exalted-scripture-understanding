The Lunar is blessed with a loyal guardian. When an enemy attacks her, her familiar makes a decisive counterattack. This counts as its action for the round, or for the next round if it’s already taken its turn. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar is in the shape of the same animal as her familiar, this Charm’s Initiative cost is transferred to the familiar before it rolls damage.
