*The Solar drives the fullness of her presence into her hand and touches someone, connecting them to the current of power that runs through her.*
Such a character is blasted away from her and lands prone. This Charm is a decisive gambit using ([[Charisma]] or [[Appearance]]) + [[Presence]], with a difficulty of 3. On a success, the Exalt lays a hand on the target, her palm surges with Solar [[Essence]], and the target is blasted back one range band and is knocked down, taking a single range band of falling damage. This Charm can be used to instantly break free of a grapple.

### On [[Holy Touch]]

This Charm can also be used socially if combat wouldn’t make sense—generally against characters the Storyteller wouldn’t have you [[Join Battle]] to defeat with a regular attack. In this case, the Solar can trigger the Charm without a gambit; roleplaying and social influence determines whether she makes the appropriate contact. I’d also like to note that a Solar who has the power of [[Holy Touch]] can gather her [[Essence]], condensing her anima into a visible sphere in her palms. This has no cost or overt social influence, but characters who see it will certainly have some reaction to it.
