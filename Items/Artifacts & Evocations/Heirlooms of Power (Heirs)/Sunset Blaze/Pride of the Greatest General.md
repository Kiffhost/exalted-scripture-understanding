Banner, [[Safety in Numbers]] Bearing the banner of Cathak herself in hand, Sunset Blaze’s master enacts a peerless strategy. Allied battle groups with elite [[Drill]] gain the following benefits:
 - They treat their effective [[Size]] as one dot higher (maximum 5).
 - They can use the wielder’s [[Initiative]] in place of their own, if higher, to determine when they act in combat.
 - The wielder’s rally for numbers action restores an additional ([[Essence]]) Magnitude to them.
 - Scarlet Banner Inspiration’s cost is waived when used to rally them.
If the wielder is fighting under a stratagem she enacted, these benefits apply to all allied battle groups, even those without elite [[Drill]].
## Resonant
Affected battle groups gain perfect morale (Exalted, p. 208).
