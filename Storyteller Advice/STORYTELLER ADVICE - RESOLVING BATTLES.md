While the decisive/withering [[Attack]] division is an abstraction and doesn’t represent different sorts of attacks within the Exalted game setting, [[Initiative]] is an abstraction of something that is more measurable—who’s pressing the advantage in a fight. Observant combatants can usually tell when they’re in trouble, or when they’ve got an opponent on the ropes. 

Most combatants in the world of Exalted aren’t fanatics—they’re soldiers doing their job to make a living or because they didn’t seem to have any other course to follow in life, or they’re thugs hoping for an easy mark, or they’re heroes with ambitions they hope to live to fulfill. While life is cheap and death is common in the Age of Sorrows, few people want to fight to the death if it means their own death. As a result, it’s worth keeping the [[Withdraw]], [[Go to Ground]], and [[Surrender]] actions in mind. Once it becomes clear that a fight can’t be won, or that the cost of doing so is unacceptably high, many opponents will attempt to lay down arms and beg for mercy or to simply run. 

Players have no obligation to let their characters’ enemies get away or to accept a surrender, but actions build reputations. Those said to be bloodthirsty and merciless can often expect no mercy on the day they find themselves outmatched.
