*Striking an efficacious pose, the Exalt catches the wind to slow a fall.*
This allows her to drop down two range bands without taking damage. In order to survive a very long fall with this Charm, the Solar must use it at least once every three bands. The Exalt can also use this Charm to drift long distances through the air, expending her movement action to float forward a single range band even as she continues to fall. With an adequate amount of thrust, the Exalt can glide across long horizontal distances without falling, equaling her initial movement forward. For example, if she were to leap out over a chasm two range bands across with [[Monkey Leap Technique]], she could then activate [[Soaring Crane Leap]] to glide across the second range band on her next turn. Appropriate stunts can increase straightacross movement before the Exalt begins to drop.
