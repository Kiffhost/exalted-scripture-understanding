*Familiar with death’s gaze, the Abyssal knows when she’s being followed by a lesser hunter.*
The Abyssal can tell when someone is watching her, even if she can’t perceive her observer, and senses whenever someone makes a roll to track her. After an enemy’s [[tracking]] roll, the Abyssal can commit three motes to attune her senses to him. This cost is reduced by one mote for each 1 on his [[tracking]] roll.
As long as the Abyssal maintains this commitment, the tracker’s 1s subtract successes on [[Perception]] rolls against the deathknight. If she attempts to ambush him, this penalty also applies to his [[Join Battle]] roll.
Each midnight, she senses approximately how far away he is from her, and can tell if he’s given up the chase. If she directly interacts with the tracker, this Charm ends once the scene is done.
The Abyssal can stack this Charm to stymy the efforts of up to ([[Essence]]) trackers.
