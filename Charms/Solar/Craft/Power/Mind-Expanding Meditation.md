The Lawgiver is a master of her trade, and uses the work she pours into her craft to inspire her towards new and greater achievements. This Charm may be invoked before an (Attribute + [[Craft]]) roll, allowing the Solar to raise her dice cap at a rate of one silver point per die, to a limit of her current [[Craft]] rating.
