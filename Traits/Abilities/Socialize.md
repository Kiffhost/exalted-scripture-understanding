**This Ability is important in social influence.** 

[[Socialize]] is a character’s understanding of the social context in which she acts, encompassing both knowledge of decorum and etiquette as well as how to use them to one’s advantage in persuasion or manipulation. In formal social situations such as an aristocratic court or a ritualized ceremony, a character can use [[Socialize]] to influence the thoughts and feelings of other characters with social actions. [[Socialize]] is also used both to read the emotional tells or body language of other characters to discern their inner thoughts, and to conceal such tells on one’s self, contributing to a character’s [[Guile]] rating.
