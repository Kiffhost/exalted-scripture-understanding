Speaking a sagely aphorism, the Dragon-Blooded calls up the winds of knowledge to disperse whatever miasma closes a student’s mind to learning. She makes a special instill roll with ([Charisma or Intelligence] + [[Lore]]) to induce a state of supernatural receptivity in a single character, treating him as though he had a Major [[Intimacy|Principle]] of “I must seek out education” for one scene. If the Dragon-Blood exploits this [[Intimacy]] with a persuade or bargain roll to convince the target to study with her, the cost of resisting increases by one [[Willpower]].
