*Even specters tremble at the viciousness that seethes within the Abyssal’s soul.*
Against influence that would weaken one of the Abyssal’s negative Intimacies, up to ([[Essence]]) 1s subtract successes from the roll against her (but not other targets). If the targeted [[Intimacy]] is Defining, the Abyssal can wait until after the influence roll to use this Charm.
## Reset 
An [[Intimacy]] can only be protected this way once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal that upholds it.
