The Lunar is the beast of judgment out of cautionary tales, the monster that mothers warn their children of and the pious swear oaths by. The Lunar chooses a custom of a culture that she has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward, or that her Solar mate rules. She embodies divine punishment against those who break it, gaining the following: 
-  She doubles [[Resolve]] bonuses from her Ties to the culture or to her Solar mate against influence that would cause her to violate the custom. 
-  When she reads a character’s intentions to determine if he’s violated the custom, intends to do so, or holds an [[Intimacy]] contrary to it, she automatically succeeds if her [[Essence]] exceeds his [[Willpower]]. 
-  When she makes a persuade or threaten roll against a member of the culture she knows has violated the custom to convince him to remedy the consequences of his transgression or face punishment, he suffers −1 [[Resolve]] and the cost to resist is increased by one [[Willpower]]. 
-  When enemies that she knows have violated the custom roll [[Join Battle]] against her, they suffer a −3 penalty. If she wins [[Join Battle]] and uses her first turn to make a decisive attack against such an enemy, it doesn’t reset her [[Initiative]]. 
-  Once during this Charm’s duration, upon successfully defeating a formidable enemy — whether in combat, debate, etc. — who she knows has violated the custom, she rolls (his [[Essence]]) dice, gaining [[Willpower]] equal to the successes, which can raise her temporary [[Willpower]] above her permanent [[Willpower]] rating, and loses one [[Limit]] for each 10. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal or legendary social goal that reinforces the custom’s importance or benefits its culture.
