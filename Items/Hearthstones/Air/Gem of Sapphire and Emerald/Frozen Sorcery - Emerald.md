With a warding gesture, the bearer halts a just-cast Terrestrial Circle spell that either targets her directly or encompasses her within its initial area of effect, freezing the magic in its tracks. She may attempt to shatter the frozen spell as a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried. This requires a ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) roll against difficulty (caster’s [[Essence]] + 3). A success shatters the frozen spell, countering it. If she doesn’t attempt this action or fails the roll, the spell thaws out at the beginning of her next turn, before she acts, and goes off as intended. This Evocation can only be used once per scene.
