*The Abyssal’s spellbinding words cage the hearts of those who read them, curdling even the bitterest of hatred into envy.*
The Abyssal makes a written inspire, instill, or persuade roll also counts as a roll to instill a Tie of admiration, respect, or fascination toward the Abyssal. Alternatively, for writing that doesn’t convey other social influence, she makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Linguistics]]) instill roll. Characters with negative Ties toward her are instilled with a Tie of envy instead. If a target already has such a Tie, the level of [[Intimacy]] needed to support his influence is reduced by one (Exalted, p. 215). This [[Intimacy]] can’t be voluntarily eroded unless a target resists this influence by spending ([[Intimacy]] + 1) [[Willpower]].
Affected characters are enthralled by the Abyssal’s peerless writing style. They increase the Tie’s [[Resolve]] penalty by −1 against the Abyssal’s influence with any ability, but can use it to bolster their [[Resolve]] against any other influence. They cannot regain [[Willpower]] from sleeping unless they spend at least an hour each day reading and re-reading the Abyssal’s writing.
