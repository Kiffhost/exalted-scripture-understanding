*The [[Solar Exalted]] are paragons of mythic heroism, with reputations earned by completing impossible feats.*
Through [[Divine Mantle]], the Lawgiver can further embody the Principles most central to her character by temporarily learning the [[Charms]] of spirits that represent the Principles the Solar has embodied. However, the Exalt may only take [[Charms]] from spirits whose nature match one of her Defining Principles, and may only take one spirit Charm for every six Solar Ability [[Charms]] she knows which match both the spirit’s nature and the Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] in question. Thus, the more strongly she embodies a certain [[Intimacy|Principle]], the more [[Charms]] she can take from the god in question. 
The Storyteller can pick from published spirits or can make up appropriate [[Charms]] on the spot for the purposes of this Charm. The Exalt may take up the [[Charms]] of multiple different spirits simultaneously, but she may have no more than ten spirit [[Charms]] through [[Divine Mantle]]. However, if the grounding [[Intimacy|Principle]] is lowered in intensity or destroyed, or if any being successfully impugns her embodiment of said [[Intimacy|Principle]] by usurping her authority, defeating her, or destroying or harming the subject of her [[Intimacy|Principle]], then she loses her ability to perform the greater miracles of the spirit’s office until she has taken actions to undo the harm or restore her damaged [[Intimacy|Principle]]. 
If the Solar wishes to change which spirit [[Charms]] she is using, she must spend one hour per Charm meditating on the target [[Intimacy|Principle]]. This allows her to move up or down the spirit’s Charm trees as needed. She can also swap ([[Essence]] or three, whichever is greater) [[Charms]] through one use of [[Mind-Cleansing Prana]]. Adding the [[Charms]] of a new spirit to her repertoire requires a new activation of the Charm.

### Sidebar
[[Divine Mantle|This Charm]] references the greater miracles of a spirit’s office, but those powers aren’t necessarily called out in the text. Treat any god’s most signature powers as their greater miracles. This is particularly true of powers with [[Essence]] minimums that match the spirit’s own permanent [[Essence]] score. If the Solar has been somehow usurped, she can still use the lesser powers of the spirit in question. She should only lose total access to powers allowed by this Charm if she fails to uphold or defend her [[Intimacy|Principle]] in some catastrophic way. [[Divine Mantle]] exists to allow Zeniths in particular to play the role of priest-king, to speak in the name of a god and do workings on that spirit’s behalf.
But this Charm is not necessarily contingent on any god’s cooperation. In the case of a Solar defeating a god and taking its power, the Storyteller can choose to activate this Charm without the player’s knowledge, ignoring its cost and allowing the Exalt to suddenly gain access to the powers of the god it has just slain, without question and without missing a beat.
A Solar who has defeated a spirit can always gain the effects of this Charm for free and without knowing she’s actually used it—but the Storyteller should never use this as an excuse to take away spirit powers the player enjoys using, or which match the character.
