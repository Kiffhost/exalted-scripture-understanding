*The Infernal's arrow unleashes a peal of thunder, a never-ending nightmare of primordial storms.*

The Infernal makes a decisive attack. If she hits, her target is knocked back one range band and falls prone. If Infernal rolls 3+ extra successes, her victim also loses one Willpower, and can't regain Willpower from sleeping for one day per additional extra success. An enemy with no Willpower remaining instead gains a Minor Derangement chosen by the Infernal's player.

The victim's impact unleashes a shockwave of nightmarish thunder. All characters within short range of the enemy must make a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Dodge) roll. If they fail, they're blasted back one range band and fall prone. They likewise lose one Willpower (or gain a Derangement) if they fail by three or more successes, and can't regain Willpower from sleep for one day for each additional success they failed by.

First Circle demons and mortals always lose Willpower, regardless how many successes are rolled. With Essence 5, this applies to all characters with Essence less than or equal to the Infernal's.
