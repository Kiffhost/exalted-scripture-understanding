*Unleashing the endless enmity forged into the Shatterbond Knives’ makers, their wielder afflicts her rival with feverish visions of battles they never fought.*
After landing a withering attack against her rival, the wielder can use this Evocation to add (Rivalry) raw damage. If she uses this Evocation on a withering attack made with [[Inseparable Enemy Reunion]], she adds that many post-soak damage dice instead.
If the attack leaves the wielder’s rival with an [[Initiative]] lower than hers, he’s afflicted with feverish visions of countless duels they’ve never had. For the rest of the scene, he suffers a −3 penalty on all rolls, and loses one [[Initiative]] at the end of each round in which he didn’t attack the wielder. This ends if he crashes or incapacitates the attacker..
## Dissonant
This Evocation is Supplemental and must be declared before the attack roll.
