*The Abyssal strikes aside her enemyâ€™s blow with contemptuous disregard.*
The Abyssal ignores all penalties to her [[Defense|Parry]] other than those inflicted by surprise attacks. If she successfully blocks an attack, her attacker loses one [[Initiative]].
While using [[Eye of the Tempest]] (p. XX), this Charm cost is reduced by one mote, and it adds +1 [[Defense|Parry]].
