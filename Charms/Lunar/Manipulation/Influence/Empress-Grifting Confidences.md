Everyone longs to be lied to, and the Lunar trickster is happy to oblige. She rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [Presence or Socialize]) as she lies to instill either a [[Intimacy|Principle]] of belief in her words, or another appropriate [[Intimacy]]. A character whose [[Resolve]] is penalized against this influence by one of his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist it until next scene, unless presented with direct evidence contradicting the lie. If the Lunar succeeds, and no affected character spends [[Willpower]] to resist by the scene’s end, she gains one [[Willpower]].
