*Tongue dripping with venom, the Dragon-Blood excoriates the speech of an ill-mannered rival.*
When she witnesses another character attempt social influence, she may speak against it, deriding the speaker or exposing the flaws in his argument with a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Socialize]]) roll. Each of her successes imposes a −1 penalty on the speaker’s influence roll. If this penalty reduces his dice pool to zero, or if he rolls and botches, his influence has the opposite of its intended effect on each character whose [[Resolve]] was beaten by the Dragon-Blood’s roll. Attempting to flatter an official would create a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] instead of a positive one, while intimidating a group of guards into standing down would cause them to attack instead. This Charm can only be used once per day.
