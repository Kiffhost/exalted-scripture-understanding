*Weaving sorcerous [[Essence]] through the flaws in a foe’s defense, the sorcerer makes his defeat part of the pattern of her spell.*
The wielder adds ([[Essence]]) Overwhelming on a withering attack roll. She may exchange up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) [[Initiative]] awarded by the attack to sorcerous motes, including [[Initiative]] from [[Initiative]] Breaks. These last until the end of the scene. If she’s shaping a spell, she doesn’t lose sorcerous motes for not taking a shape [[sorcery]] action that turn. 
## Resonant
If this Evocation brings the wielder to the total needed to cast a spell, she may pay one [[Willpower]] to do so reflexively.
