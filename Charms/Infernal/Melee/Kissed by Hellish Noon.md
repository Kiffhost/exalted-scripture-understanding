*Emerald flames erupt from the edge of the Infernal’s blade to incinerate distant foes.*

The Infernal makes a withering or decisive attack against an enemy within short range. The emerald blaze is unblockable unless her target defends with an artifact weapon, defensive magic, or a stunt.

Withering attacks add an automatic success on the damage roll. Decisive attacks receive [[Green Sun Nimbus Flare]]’s benefits for free. This can be enhanced with its [[Keys]], though Infernal must still pay their costs.
## [[Keys]]
#### Sky-Scorching Fury (Melee 4, Essence 2) (+2m)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote surcharge to extend the attack’s range to medium. At bonfire anima, this increases to long range.
