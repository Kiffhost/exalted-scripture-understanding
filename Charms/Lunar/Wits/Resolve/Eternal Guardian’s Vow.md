*The Lunar is heir to a passion of many lifetimes, an eternal bond not easily sundered.*
She may treat influence that would cause her to harm her Solar mate or treat him in a manner contrary to a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] she has toward him as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220), unless it’s his influence. A character may create an opportunity to turn the Lunar against her mate with a special instill action, rolling twice and using the lower of the two results. Success denies the Lunar this Charm’s protection against that character’s influence until she upholds the [[Intimacy|Tie]] to her mate while it’s at Defining intensity.
