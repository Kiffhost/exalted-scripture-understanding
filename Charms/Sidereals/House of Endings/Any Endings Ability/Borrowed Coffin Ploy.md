*Anticipating the inevitable, the Sidereal eulogizes those still living.*
The Sidereal makes a (Manipulation + Endings Ability) instill roll to deceive her listeners into thinking that a person has died, a group has been destroyed or disbanded, or an ongoing phenomenon has ended. If the Sidereal presents some evidence of this, no matter how flimsy, she ignores (higher of Essence or 3) points of penalty for making implausible claims.
Characters can’t use Intimacies to bolster their Resolve against this influence unless they have some information or evidence that contradicts the Sidereal’s claims.
Likewise, the unaware can’t spend Willpower to resist this influence unless they’re presented with evidence that directly contradicts the Sidereal’s lie.
