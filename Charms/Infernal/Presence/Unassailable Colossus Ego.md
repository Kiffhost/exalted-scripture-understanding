*The Infernal’s forceful personality has an almost physical weight, crushing any efforts to sway her from her course.*

The Infernal can use this Charm to defend against influence that’s opposed by a Tie to herself or another Intimacy that expresses how she sees herself. The cost and effect depend on the Intimacy’s intensity: five motes for Minor and Major, or five motes and one Willpower for Defining.
### Minor
The Infernal adds (Essence) Resolve. The Willpower cost to resist is reduced by one unless she has a Major or Defining Intimacy that supports the influence. She can’t voluntarily weaken the Intimacy for the rest of the day. This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived.
### Major
The Infernal adds (Essence) non-Charm Resolve. She reduces the Willpower cost to resist by one and can do so without needing to enter a Decision Point. She can’t voluntarily weaken the Intimacy for the rest of the story.
### Defining
The Infernal treats the influence as unacceptable. She can’t voluntarily weaken the Intimacy for the rest of the story. Even after the story ends, she must pay three Willpower each time she wishes to do so for as long as she has that Intimacy.

The Infernal can also use this Charm against Psyche effects that would fundamentally alter her sense of self. She gains the benefit of a Major Intimacy, though the Storyteller may deem some effects so severe that they warrant a Defining Intimacy’s effect.
## Reset
Once per day for Major Intimacies and once per story for Defining Intimacies. The Infernal can reset this by upholding the Intimacy she defended, as long as it remains at the same intensity or higher.
