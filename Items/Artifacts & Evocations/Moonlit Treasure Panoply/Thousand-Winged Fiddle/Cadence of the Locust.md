The fiddler’s performance calls to creeping insects, drawing a swarming audience.
The fiddle’s music can be used to communicate with insects and insect-like beings, conveying ideas as complex as they can understand without the need for a shared language. This negates the [[Resolve]] bonus targets receive for lacking one. However, the fiddler doesn’t gain any ability to understand them.
The fiddler can pay two motes to add (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on any roll that involves communicating with insects or insect-like beings, as long as she uses the fiddle to do so. This includes influence rolls, [[Survival]] rolls, and command actions for battle groups of such characters. Enhanced command actions can be rolled with ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]). The dice are non-Charm for grasshoppers.
