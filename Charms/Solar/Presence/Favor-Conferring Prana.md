This Charm copies the effect of Empowering Shout, but allows the Solar to empower an ally indefinitely. The subject’s Attribute and Ability ratings may not be increased past five with this Charm, nor may he begin to learn Charms or magic he doesn’t truly qualify for. Because this is a different Charm than its prerequisite, it may be used in conjunction with Empowering Shout.
