*The banquets of gods are as dust in the Infernal’s mouth compared to her victim’s succulent agony.*

If the Infernal deals 3+ decisive damage to an enemy, his wound penalty is increased by one for the rest of the scene. This penalty stacks, but can’t raise an enemy’s wound penalty by more than (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3).

Once per day, the Infernal may gain one Willpower when she raises an enemy’s wound penalty to −4 or higher with this Charm.
