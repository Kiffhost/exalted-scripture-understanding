*Creation itself seems to hold its breath as the stylist cloaks herself in the majestic and terrible stillness of the Righteous Devil Form. An inescapable gravity seems to exude from her confident, unwavering posture, sending the innocent scurrying away to safety and calling the unjust to reap the whirlwind of judgment they’ve sown.*
The first time the Righteous Devil enters this form in a fight, she may roll (Charisma + Presence + Essence) to intimidate all enemies or inspire them with an emotion of shame, guilt, or remorse as appropriate to their sins. Affected enemies take a penalty equal to the stylist’s Charisma on disengage, withdraw, or Stealth-based actions unless they pay Willpower to resist.
Additionally, at the beginning of each turn, the Righteous Devil may reflexively aim against any enemy whose Resolve was overcome by the activation of this form, or by a similar influence roll made in combat (even if he resisted).
Additionally, while in this form, the Righteous Devil can use firewands effectively in close combat, using the butt or handle of a flame weapon to effectively bludgeon enemies. When used in this way, they are treated as medium weapon with the bashing, martial arts, and shield tags. Firewands with an affixed bayonet instead have the lethal tag. While this use is not compatible with effects that specifically modify ranged attacks, such as the range extension of Blossom of Inevitable Demise, it can still benefit from other Charms of this or other staff or spear compatible styles. 
## Special activation rules
Whenever the stylist successfully lands a decisive attack after taking an aim action on her previous turn, she may reflexively activate Righteous Devil Form.
