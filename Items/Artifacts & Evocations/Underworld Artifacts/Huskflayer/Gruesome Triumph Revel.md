*Sloughing off the bloated bulk of rotting flesh that encysts her scythe, Huskflayer’s wielder readies it for a fatal blow.*
To use this Evocation, Huskflayer’s wielder must have at least 6+ banked gore points. She empties her gore pool and rolls [[Join Battle]], adding a non-Charm die for each gore point expended.
## Resonant
This Evocation loses the Perilous keyword.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by reaping gore points from incapacitating a nontrivial enemy.
