*Exposure to Wyld energies can cause hallucinations, addiction, insanity, and even terrible mutations.*
When the Exalt is exposed to such energies, she immediately senses the warping danger that surrounds her. She may then choose to pay five motes, one [[Willpower]] to immunize her mind, body, and equipment against the Wyld’s twisting power for as long as she keeps motes committed. The Solar’s sense of such danger becomes instinctive; she may even activate this Charm while she is asleep or incapacitated. 
This Charm can also be used to shield the Solar against other environmental effects which would warp her mind or body, such as the twisting choral of the demon prince with voice like crystal facets, or the tainted [[Essence]] emanating from the intestines of a malfunctioning First Age manse. But be warned: once the Lawgiver is addicted to the Wyld or mutated by twisting energies, this Charm will not discontinue such effects; it will only prevent her condition from worsening. While [[Integrity]]-Protecting Prana protects the Solar and her possessions from being subject to environmental twisting powers, it does not allow her to ignore Wyld phenomena. She can still be torn apart by Wyld-spawned ravenous cyclones of burning teeth and giant hundred-armed mantises. 
This Charm also does not defend against attacks that might warp her mind or body directly, such as the Wyld-Mind Strike of the Thousand Venoms Mistress, or fiat-level changes to her existence caused by alterations to the Loom of Fate.
