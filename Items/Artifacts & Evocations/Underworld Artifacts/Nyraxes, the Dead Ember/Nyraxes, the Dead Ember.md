*The Underworld has had many failed suns, the passion-projects of ancient necromancer-kings and nephwrack savants.*
The bale-star known as Nyraxes was a particularly spectacular example, forged by an exiled potentate known as the King Clad in Tattered Glories. Denied a place among the ranks of his people’s honored dead, he sought to usurp their afterlife, supplanting it with one of his own design. The king kindled Nyraxes within his dread forge, with a core of ever-molten soulsteel trapped within concentric rings of bone stolen from the behemoth known as the Wandering Ivory Woods.
The King Clad in Tattered Glories placed Nyraxes within the firmament of his fledgling kingdom, a light to draw the ghosts of his people to him. For seven days it burned, and his people arrived with its mesmeric blue flame reflected in their eyes. On the eighth day, it fell and reduced the King and his kingdom to cinder and lamentation.
It is unknown who stole the ever-smoldering embers that fell from the star or the shards of soulsteel that dotted that landscape, but they forged them into a lantern, a ball of blue flame licking at the glass panes of its cage. Nyraxes remains a guiding star for the undead in this new form, drawing them to its master. In its history, it has passed through the hands of tyrants both dead and living. The Stark Princess wielded it as a war-banner for her seven champion wraiths, but was betrayed by the eighth; the exorcist-prince Ketha of the Rime immolated the ghosts of seven of his wrathful siblings, but fell to his youngest brother. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of Nyraxes

Nyraxes’ bearer may dampen or kindle its flame at her whim, reducing it to a spark too faint to draw attention or a blue blaze equal to a burning anima (p. XX). Upon attuning to Nyraxes, its wielder awakens [[Dancing Cinder Allure]] for free.
