The Lunar keeps a close watch over what’s hers. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) non-Charm dice on a roll to detect someone stealing from her, and can contest magic that’s normally unnoticeable. If successful, she may immediately Join Battle, adding extra successes on the theft-detection roll as dice to her roll. If she beats the thief’s Join Battle roll and uses her first turn to attack him, this is a surprise attack (Exalted, p. 203). Alternatively, this Charm can protect against disarm gambits, granting +1 Defense and increasing the gambit’s difficulty by (Lunar’s Perception/2, rounded up). If the gambit misses or fails, the Lunar may respond with a decisive counterattack.
