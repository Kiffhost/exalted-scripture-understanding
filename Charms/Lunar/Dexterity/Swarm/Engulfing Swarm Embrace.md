*Casting off countless duplicates, the Lunar traps foes within the teeming mass of herself.*
As the Lunar makes a grapple gambit, she splits off a copy of herself, as with [[Cunning Anglerfish Decoy]], to join in the clinch. She can further bolster her ranks by using [[Cunning Anglerfish Decoy]] reflexively to create additional replicas before rolling. The gambit inflicts an additional point of onslaught penalty, and each replica within close range of the Lunar adds one die on her attack and control rolls.
If an enemyâ€™s attack would cause the Lunar to lose a round of control over the grapple, she can sacrifice a replica within close range instead, letting the attack destroy it to preserve her control. Once the grapple ends, all of these duplicates fade away.
If the Lunar has [[Ant-and-Starfish Trick]], she can transfer control of the grapple to independent replicas to maintain, leaving her free to act. Those replicas can still sacrifice other replicas to preserve rounds of control. She can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to enhance the replica created by this Charm as per [[Ant-and-Starfish Trick]].

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size may learn this as a [[Manipulation]] or [[Wits]] Charm.
