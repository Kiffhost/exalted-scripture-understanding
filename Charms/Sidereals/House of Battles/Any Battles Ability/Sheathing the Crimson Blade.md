*Accepting the harsh realities of battle, the Sidereal’s expression and demeanor betray no sign of her premeditation of violence.*
The Sidereal can use any Battles Ability instead of Socialize to calculate Guile. For one mote, she gains +2 Guile against an effect that would reveal her hostile intentions or negative Ties.
