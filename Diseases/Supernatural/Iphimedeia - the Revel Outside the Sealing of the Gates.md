Iphimedeia’s only known vector in the modern age is Citrine Poxes of Contagion style. Sidereals debate its nature. Evidence of a mysterious Fourth Supreme Plague? A weapon of the enemies of the gods? A terrible secret hidden in the Essence of all things? It warps and melts its victim’s flesh and drives them to feverish dancing. If someone who wishes to have a child is infected and subsequently recovers, his player may choose to have him become pregnant, regardless of whether he could normally bear children. Medical treatment is useless unless enhanced by magic. Its flesh-warping symptoms are a Shaping effect, while the compulsion to dance is a Psyche effect. 
# Minor
The victim suffers one die of aggravated damage each day, ignoring Hardness, as her flesh distorts. She adds (Intensity) successes on dance-based Performance rolls. If he can dance without facing any meaningful risks or consequences, he must do so, requiring him to flurry to take any action other than dancing. He may pay one Willpower to resist for a day. 
# Major
As above, but the victim’s flesh is noticeably warped, imposing a −1 crippling penalty on physical rolls. The damage it inflicts increases to (victim’s Resolve) dice; the first roll occurring upon reaching Major Intensity. The compulsion to dance now applies even when doing so is dangerous, even in combat. 
# Defining
As above, but the victim’s body is half-melted and constantly deteriorating. The crippling penalty increases to −3 and the damage inflicted increases to (victim’s Resolve + 5) dice; the first roll occurring upon reaching Defining intensity. Spending Willpower only lets him reduce the urge to dance for a scene, not a day. 
# Death
The victim’s warped and distorted flesh finally slips free as he completes one final dance, shaking off globs of skin and muscle until all that remains is his spasming skeleton.
