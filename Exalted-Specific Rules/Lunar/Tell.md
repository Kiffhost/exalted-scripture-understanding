Every Lunar has a [[Tell]], a distinctive mark that appears in any form she takes. It might be an animal feature, like a leopard’s tail or a ram’s horns; a physical trait, like a blind eye or scar; a nonvisual trait, like a pungent scent or a trilling voice; or a subtle supernatural display, like a shadow that moves independently. If a [[Tell]] is inapplicable to a specific form, it shifts into a more suitable form while remaining distinctively identifiable. If a Lunar whose [[Tell]] is goat-like eyes becomes an eyeless animal, she might manifest distinctive eyelike markings.

The Tell’s nature is to go unnoticed. Nontrivial characters can attempt a difficulty 7 ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll to notice a Lunar’s [[Tell]]. Characters who’ve previously detected the Lunar’s [[Tell]] receive three bonus dice. Magic that enhances attempts to see through disguises applies on this roll. Success lets them notice the [[Tell]], or, if they’ve noticed it before in a different form, identify her as the same individual. On failure, that character can’t roll again while the Lunar remains in that shape. If a shapeshifted Lunar acts uncharacteristically, witnesses knowledgeable enough to recognize the discrepancy may roll to detect her [[Tell]] again with one to three bonus dice. The Storyteller should award higher bonuses for more egregious discrepancies, and for onlookers who verify their suspicions with read intentions or [[profile character]] actions.

While circumstances may penalize rolls to notice a Lunar’s [[Tell]], it’s never completely impossible to detect unless she knows [[Subtle Silver Declaration]]. Once her anima reaches the glowing level, her [[Tell]] becomes obvious.

A Lunar whose [[Tell]] is a physical feature may take a mutation to represent it. Such a [[Tell]] can be noticed normally by onlookers, but not the fact that it’s a feature they’ve seen on the Lunar’s other forms; making that connection requires a roll, as above.
