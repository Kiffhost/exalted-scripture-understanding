*As the Abyssal’s world crumbles around her, something vast and terrible stirs in the depths of her soul, urging her to embrace her apocalyptic purpose.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she faces a profound challenge to her beliefs and Intimacies — being forced to act against a Defining [[Intimacy]], being imprisoned by enemies who challenge her loyalty to her Deathord, watching someone she has a Defining Tie of love for die. She may waive the costs of up to three [[Charms]] used to defend against social influence, physical injury, or disease or to threaten those who’ve wronged her. This can’t waive experience costs.
## Reset 
Once per day unless reset by making a significant sacrifice in order to uphold a Defining [[Intimacy]] or death’s chivalry.
