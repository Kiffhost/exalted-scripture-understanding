This bizarre disease occurs in nature, but it’s vanishingly rare. The Convention on Pestilence has documented a total of forty cases in the Second Age and has no conclusive theory as to its cause. It fractures the victim’s Essence, weakening his body’s physical integrity and coherence. The least harm can sever limbs or cut loose organs, but such wounds are trifling concerns. A severed limb stuck back on its stump will regrow and reattach; a swallowed organ slides back into place. A detached body part doesn’t bleed, deteriorate, or decay; neither does the flesh from which it was expelled. Reattaching it is a miscellaneous action. While characters suffer ill effects from losing vital organs like hearts and lungs, this isn’t fatal as long as the organ remains intact. Attacking a detached body part is treated as attacking the victim for all purposes, including him being able to use his Charms to defend. Medical treatment is useless unless enhanced by magic. It’s a Shaping effect that alters the body as well as a disease. 
# Minor
The first time the victim takes decisive damage each scene, he suffers a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201) commensurate to the damage dealt, though it doesn’t reduce damage. Injuries inflicted by this disease don’t count against the once-per-scene limit. Detached body parts heal instantly upon being reattached. 
# Major
As above, and when the victim suffers enough decisive damage to increase his wound penalty, he suffers a commensurate crippling injury. Reattached body parts don’t heal until the current scene ends. 
# Defining
As above, and the victim suffers a crippling injury when he’s crashed. Use half the withering damage, rounded up, instead of decisive damage to determine the injury’s severity. Reattached body parts don’t heal until the victim’s received a full night’s rest. 
# Death
The victim loses all physical coherence, sloughing off skin, muscle, organs, and bone until his body has fallen apart completely. This incapacitates him but isn’t fatal: his tissues remain alive and capable of reattachment, but no amount of care can keep up with the pace of his deterioration. The Exalted and similarly resilient beings never reach this stage.
