*A raging nimbus of flames surrounds the Dragon-Blood’s forces, manifesting her martial prowess as she urges them onward.*
Deadly flames dance along the edges of their swords and the points of their spears as they charge. She adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on a command action to give orders. In addition to adding to the battle group’s attack roll, this also adds one die to its damage roll for every two successes. The battle group may immediately take its turn for the round to complete the orders on her tick if it hasn’t already acted this round, regardless of its place in [[Initiative]] order. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset when an allied battle group attacks under the Dragon-Blood’s orders and deals enough damage to incapacitate a significant foe, or successfully routs an enemy battle group by depleting its Magnitude.
