*The Infernal marshals her soldiers’ shadows, raising them up to fill in the ranks.*

The Infernal doubles 8s on a rally for numbers action. If she has any remaining successes after filling the battle group’s Magnitude, it gains an additional dot of Size. At the end of the scene, the shadows return to their owners, removing the extra Size.
## [[Keys]]
#### Stolen Legion Stratagem (War 4) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm reflexively when an enemy makes a rally for numbers action. She steals shadows from routed foes, causing the general’s 1s to subtract successes from his roll. However, the Infernal can’t restore more than (her Essence + enemy’s 1s) Magnitude this way.
