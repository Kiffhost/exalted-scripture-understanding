The flesh of one of the sorcerer’s hands splits to reveal a monstrous gaping mouth with fangs of tourmaline and a squirming viridian tongue. The maw leeches away at water, condensing vapor from thin air and desiccating plants or living flesh. She rolls (Intelligence + Occult) as an unblockable decisive attack against all characters, including allies, in a ninety-degree arc out to medium range. Against battle groups, it’s unblockable and undodgeable. Each character hit suffers ([sorcerer’s Intelligence + extra successes] − [lower of target’s Stamina or Resistance])A dice of decisive damage, minimum one die. This doesn’t include the sorcerer’s Initiative or reset her to base Initiative. Enemies with no body moisture whatsoever, such as fire elementals or bonesiders, are immune. Conversely, enemies primarily made of liquid, such as water elementals, don’t subtract anything from the damage. Trivial plant life within range is completely desiccated, dying instantly. Moisture siphoned by this spell is gathered into a sphere of solid water that floats above the sorcerer’s hand for up to a few minutes after casting this spell. The sorcerer may direct it into a container for storage, or it can be drawn on with Charms such as Elemental Sheath (p. 225). Even if there are no victims of her spell, she may gather water with it in all but the most arid environments. 

A sorcerer with this as her control spell has a devil-maw permanently opened on one of her palms. Unarmed attacks with that hand deal aggravated damage and gain the Piercing tag (Exalted, p. 586) against enemies that have any body moisture, draining it through their armor. Against water elementals and similar enemies, her unarmed attacks deal an additional die of withering or decisive damage.
