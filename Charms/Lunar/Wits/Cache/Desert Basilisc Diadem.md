*The Lunar can half-absorb hearthstones, socketing them in her flesh.*
She gains absorbed hearthstones’ benefits as though they were socketed in an attuned artifact. Hearthstones that enhance weapons apply their benefit to her unarmed attacks and natural weapons, if appropriate, while hearthstones that enhance armor apply to her natural soak. Such effects are compatible with any magic that transforms parts of the Lunar’s body into weapons or armor. If she uses [[Last Warrior’s Unity]] (p. XX) to merge with an artifact weapon that has one or more empty hearthstone slots, she may treat absorbed hearthstones as being socketed in those slots for the duration. Absorbing or removing a hearthstone is a miscellaneous action, and the Lunar may socket (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) hearthstones at a time. If she conceals an embedded hearthstone with clothing or the like, it can only be noticed by characters who’ve spotted her [[Lunar Shapeshifting/Tell]] this scene (p. XX).
