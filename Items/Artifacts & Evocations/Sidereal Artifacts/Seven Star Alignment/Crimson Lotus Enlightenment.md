*Whispering the incantation spoken by Pavonis with his last breath, Seven Star Alignment’s master draws forth is greatest power.* 
## Resonant
Only characters resonant with this artifact can awaken this Evocation. An attack made with a spell can benefit from Martial Arts Charms that are compatible with seven-section staffs, treating the spell as one of their style weapons. If the spell has multiple targets, the wielder must pay a ten-mote, one Willpower surcharge. This Evocation isn’t compatible with Sidereal Martial Arts, unless the wielder is a Sidereal.
