The Sidereal maintains perfect tranquility even as she juggles countless projects, rising above the frantic masses milling about her. When the Sidereal succeeds on a [[Bureaucracy]], [[Integrity]], [[Investigation]], or [[Lore]] roll, she gains motes equal to the 9s and 10s on the roll. When she successfully asserts her [[Resolve]] against an inspire roll, an instill roll to create or strengthen an emotion-based Tie, or any influence that tempts her with opportunities for pleasure or self-indulgence, she gains motes equal to the 1s and 2s on the influence roll. This can’t exceed the number of motes spent enhancing the roll or value. When the Sidereal upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] through knowledge or exerting dominance over another, she may gain five motes in place of the [[Willpower]] she’d normally receive (Exalted, p. 169).
