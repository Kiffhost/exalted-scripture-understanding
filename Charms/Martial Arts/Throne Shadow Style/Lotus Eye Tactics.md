*The vizier’s learned eye discerns peers and worthy foes from the masses.*
The stylist makes a special (Perception + Martial Arts) read intentions roll. Success lets her player ask the Storyteller one of the following questions about her target plus an additional question for every three extra successes. 
- How significant a threat would he pose to me in combat? 
- What should I watch out for in a fight with him? 
- Does he have any weapons, armor, or nearby allies I don’t know about? 
- Who’s someone he learned to fight from?
If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the stylist’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
