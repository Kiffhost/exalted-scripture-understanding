This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite.
*The Solar can track her prey’s scent with the unerring accuracy of a bloodhound, or find her victim’s scent with the methodical sipping of a serpent.*
The Exalt adds her [[Perception]] or a minimum of 2 automatic successes to any [[Survival]]-based rolls to track a character or hunt for food or water using her sense of smell, and extends her range for doing so to (half her [[Essence]] rounded up) miles. She also gains the ability to scent moods, making an automatically successful scent-based read intentions action to determine a target’s disposition. She can add scentless, tasteless subjects to her scent library and taste index. She can also add items to her taste index by merely smelling them, as well as reference those tastes by smell alone. With a harmless drop on her tongue, she can identify a poison she has tasted, and she can detect a tasteless poison by the way it dilutes a drink or acts as an unknown ingredient in a meal whose flavors are well known to her. 
In addition, bleeding characters (those with a wound penalty of -1 or greater) and characters who are severely injured (-4 wound penalty) are easier to find. Add 1 or 2 dice to an [[Awareness]] roll against the target’s [[Stealth]]. This Charm follows the special activation rules of [[Unsurpassed Sight Discipline]] (p. 271), discounting the cost of taste and smell effects instead of those which enhance sight.
