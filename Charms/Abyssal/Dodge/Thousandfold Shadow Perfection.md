*The deathknight savors her enemy’s despair in the face of an invincible foe.*
After dodging an attack with Wraith-Form Avoidance, the Abyssal is suffused with dark power. She gains one Initiative plus an additional Initiative at the start of each turn. She loses this benefit if she’s hit by an attack, enters concealment, or is at long range or further from all enemies.
