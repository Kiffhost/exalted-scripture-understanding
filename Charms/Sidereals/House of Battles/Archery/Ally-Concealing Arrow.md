The Sidereal’s feint creates a blind spot in her enemy’s guard, leaving him vulnerable to a fatal strike. A successful distract gambit lets its beneficiary reflexively roll [[Stealth]] to enter concealment. If he beats the opposed roll of the gambit’s target and attacks her before she takes her next turn, his attack becomes an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal can use [[Misdirected Wisdom Trick]] to enhance the gambit, waiving its [[Initiative]] cost.
