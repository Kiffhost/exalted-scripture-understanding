Painting with moonlight and dreams, the Lunar creates works of heartbreaking beauty.
When painting, the Lunar can use [[Beast-God Idolatry]] to convey any inspire or instill roll. She must still include a depiction of herself or one of her shapes in the painting.
Once per day, the Lunar can invoke an [[Intimacy]] to waive Beast-God Idolatry’s [[Willpower]] cost if her art relates to that [[Intimacy]].
With [[Essence]] 2, the Lunar can also convey persuade rolls.
