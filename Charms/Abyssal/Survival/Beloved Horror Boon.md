*The deathknight’s familiar partakes of its master’s deathly Essence, the better to serve her dark desires.*
Each purchase of this Charm lets the deathknight grant one of the boons below a familiar she’s enhanced with Fetter the Beast, which she must spend this Charm’s training time working with. Some boons have Survival or Essence minimums or require the familiar to have one or more other boons. Boons that increase a familiar’s traits can’t raise dice pools above 14 dice or static values above 7.
### Cadaver-Beast Thews
The familiar adds two dice on feats of strength and rolls against poison and disease.
It gains +1 soak and adds +1 to the base damage of its withering attacks.
### Dread Predator Alacrity
The familiar adds two dice on attack rolls and movement actions, and gains +1 Parry.
### Lurking Horror Refinement
The familiar adds two dice on Perception rolls and Stealth rolls, and gains +1 Evasion.
Carrion-Eater’s Wisdom (Survival 5; One boon): The familiar gains human-level intelligence and learns all languages the Abyssal knows, though it can only speak them if its anatomy allows. It gains +1 permanent Willpower, Guile, and Resolve, and gains dix-die pools for Diagnosing Ailments, Investigation, Read Intentions, and Strategy.
Corpse-Hide Resilience (Survival 5; One boon): The familiar gains +3 soak and +1 Hardness. The Abyssal can purchase this benefit up to (Essence) times for each familiar.
Endurance Beyond Extinction (Survival 5; One boon): The familiar gains an additional −1 health level and two −2 levels. The Abyssal can purchase this benefit up to (Essence) times for each familiar.
Wretched Abomination Form (Survival 5; One boon) The familiar gains five dots of mutations. The Abyssal can purchase this benefit up to (Essence) times for each familiar.
Unholy Beast of Slaughter (Survival 5, Essence 3; Two boons): Whenever the Abyssal gains Initiative from a withering damage roll, the familiar gains half that much Initiative, rounded up, maximum (Abyssal’s Essence). To receive this benefit, the familiar must already have at least two others.
