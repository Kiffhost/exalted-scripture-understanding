*The necromancer channels the heat of a thousand decaying dead into the ground, burning a brand into the earth to call forth countless grasping skeletal hands.*
The area out to medium range around the necromancer becomes a field of grasping skeletal hands for the rest of the scene. This is both difficult terrain and an environmental hazard with difficulty (Intelligence), Damage 1B/round. Damaged enemies fall prone. Prone characters within the field must always roll to rise as the frenzied hands grasp at them and suffer a −3 penalty on rolls to do so.
The necromancer and her allies aren’t affected by the field.
## Control
The necromancer may raise a field that lasts until the next sunrise. She can also delay the field’s manifestation, branding her handprint into the earth.
It can be unleashed reflexively if she’s within medium range of the brand and can also be set to trigger if one of the living enters the area. At times, skeletal hands emerge from nearby surfaces or within the necromancer’s attire to aid in simple tasks.
## Distortion (10)
The distorting spellcaster is immune to the field’s effects. Its grasp momentarily weakens, suppressing its effect on prone characters until the start of the distorting character’s next turn.
