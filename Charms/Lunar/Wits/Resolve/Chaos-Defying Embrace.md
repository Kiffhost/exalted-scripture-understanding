*Even as the world falls into madness, the Lunar keeps safe those things closest to her heart.*
She may pay a ten-mote surcharge to use [[Resisting the [[Lure]] of Madness]] or [[Laughing Into the Teeth of Madness]] to protect a character within medium range she has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward from an applicable effect. She can’t undo effects already inflicted on a character. The Lunar can protect her Solar mate regardless of the intensity of her [[Intimacy|Tie]] to him. Successfully protecting him grants her one [[Willpower]].
