*The Infernal descends from on high to demonstrate the errors of those beneath her.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she jumps down to reach close range with an enemy and attacks him on the same turn. She can also use it when she attacks an enemy who’s at least at short range vertically beneath her. She adds an automatic success on a withering or decisive damage roll.

The Infernal suffers no penalties for flurrying this attack with an influence roll to instil a Principle that she has herself, or a persuade roll that leverages such an Intimacy. If she does, she adds (her Intimacy) dice of post-soak withering damage or one die of decisive damage.
### Keys
