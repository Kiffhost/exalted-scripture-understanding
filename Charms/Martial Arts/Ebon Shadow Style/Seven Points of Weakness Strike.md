Pinpointing a seam or flaw in an enemy’s armor, the martial artist strikes through it with the expert precision of a trained assassin. Seven Points of Weakness Strike subtracts (the martial artist’s Stealth) from her enemy’s armored soak. Unexpected attacks double the amount of soak ignored. 

## Mastery

If this Charm reduces an enemy’s armored soak to zero against a withering attack, any remaining points of soak reduction are converted to post-soak damage dice.
