*The Infernal’s performance haunts her audience’s nightmares, an irresistible obsession that gnaws at their sanity.*

The Infernal doubles 8s and adds a free full Excellency on an influence roll. On an influence roll, the cost to resist increases to three Willpower and requires citing a Major or Defining Intimacy in a Decision Point.

Even if a character resists, the Infernal’s performance haunts his dreams, subjecting him to that influence again each night. If he doesn’t resist, he can’t recover Willpower from sleeping. This lingering Psyche effect ends once he’s resisted it (Infernal’s Essence) times.

With Essence 5, the Infernal doubles 7s on the roll.
## Reset
Once per day unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Intimacy with a performance.
