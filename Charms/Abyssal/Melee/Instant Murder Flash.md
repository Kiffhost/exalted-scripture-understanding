*Like a ravening specter, the Exalt cuts down all opposition in the blink of an eye.*
The deathknight makes (lowest of Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina) decisive attacks against one or more enemies. She can divide her Initiative among attacks however she wishes for their damage, minimum one per attack. She resets to base Initiative after completing all attacks if any of them hit, or loses two initiative per attack if they all miss. If the Abyssal uses any non-Excellency Melee Charms to enhance her attacks, she need only pay their cost once to benefit all of them.
With a Melee 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can make up to (highest of Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina) attacks and adds Initiative equal to the number of attacks she makes to the total she can allocate among them. She may move a single range band before each attack.
## Special activation rules
When the Abyssal uses Time-Scything Technique, she can use this Charm reflexively to make its multiple attacks, as above, instead of just one.
