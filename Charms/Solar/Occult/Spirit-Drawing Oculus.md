*The Solar may channel the [[Essence]] of the world through her body, becoming a momentary vector for incredible power.*
While her anima is iconic, the Exalt perceives the flows of [[Essence]] around her. Even as she recognizes the inherent genius of cosmic design, she sees its flaws—loose or wasted motes, cast off from expelled [[Charms]] or [[Templates/sorcery]], or flowing from fissures in the dragon tracks. For one [[Willpower]], she may cast off her anima, shedding it to the dim level. It dissipates, flowing out across the world in all directions, and every loose mote it passes is drawn back to the Solar. Roll a free full [[Occult]] Excellency of the Solar’s ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]); successes on this roll determine how many motes the Solar is able to gather. These motes may only be used to power [[Charms]] from [[Craft]], [[Investigation]], [[Medicine]], [[Lore]], and [[Occult]], or added to the mote total of a shaping action by the Solar. [[Spirit-Drawing Oculus]] may only be used once per day.
