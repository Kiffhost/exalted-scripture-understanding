The Sidereal’s calm certainty in the face of danger turns away harm, leaving enemies to question whether she can even defeated by the likes of them. The Sidereal causes an attack against her to miss unless her attacker enters a Decision Point and spends one Willpower. The intensity of Intimacy he must cite to resist depends on the Sidereal’s Initiative relative to his: BEGIN TABLE Sidereal’s Initiative Intensity Lower than attacker’s Initiative by 6+ No Intimacy needed Lower than attacker’s Initiative by 1-5 Minor Equal or higher than attacker’s Initiative by 1-9 Major Higher than attacker’s Initiative by 10+ Defining END TABLE Once a character’s spent Willpower to resist, he’s immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene.
