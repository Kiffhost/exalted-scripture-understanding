*The Infernal steps into another’s life, as uncanny a duplicate as his own reflection.*

The Infernal adds (Manipulation) dice on a disguise roll to impersonate another character and ignores penalties for not being familiar with him. If she knows one of the impersonated character’s Major or Defining Intimacies, the added dice are non-Charm. The disguise is always mirrored right-to-left, though this can’t be noticed except by characters who’ve seen through the disguise.

If the Infernal breaks character, allowing observers to make a roll opposing her disguise, the dice bonus those characters receive is reduced by one. If the Infernal shares one of the subject’s Intimacies at the same intensity or higher, the bonus is reduced by (Intimacy) instead.
## Special activation rules
If the Infernal uses this Charm together with [[Loom-Snarling Deception]], she waives this Charm’s cost. She mimics the impersonated character’s fate rather than assuming a fictitious one.
## [[Keys]]
#### One and the Same (Larceny 5, Essence 3) (5m)
If the Infernal shares one of the impersonated character’s Major or Defining Intimacies at the same intensity or higher, she’s never at risk of compromising the disguise by acting “out of character.” If she’s about to break character, she senses this and can pay five motes to stop short just in time to avoid breaking character. She doesn’t learn why it would be out of character. However, she can’t voluntarily weaken Intimacies she shares with the impersonated character while she’s disguised.
