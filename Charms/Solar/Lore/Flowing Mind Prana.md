*The Lawgiver is a master instructor, capable of passing on truths and talents as surely as the sun passes daylight.*
To activate this Charm, the Solar commits a number of experience points from her own unspent experience total. She may confer these experience points to another character by delivering a lesson she has constructed, allowing her to train a character’s Attributes or Abilities up to a rating of 5, even if this puts the character beyond her own rating. However, for each three experience points the Solar spends on the character in question, that character must adopt, at the Minor level, an [[Intimacy]] the Solar holds. The Solar may choose which [[Intimacy]] is conferred. For each three experience points conferred, the Solar may confer individual [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], or she may increase a single [[Intimacy]]’s intensity from Minor to Major, or from Major to Defining, so long as she holds that [[Intimacy]] at the Major or Defining level herself. [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] conferred in this manner cannot be decayed for any reason until the character has performed at least one task equal to that [[Intimacy]]’s intensity (p. 215). The Solar has sole discretion over who is able to benefit from the experience points on offer. Refer to training times on page 178 to determine how long each training session should take. At the end of each story, the Solar may roll a number of dice equal to experience points spent on this Charm, regaining a number of experience equal to her successes, but not beyond the total amount of experience she expended in training. A Solar with [[Socialize]] [[Charms]] related to the creation of personas may use this Charm while in the guise of a persona, but she must pay from both her main unspent experience total and the persona’s unspent experience total to do so. Lastly, the Solar cannot benefit from this or any other experience-granting training Charm in the same story in which she uses it to benefit someone else.
