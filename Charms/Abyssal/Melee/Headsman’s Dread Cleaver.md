*The deathknight swings huge, foe-cleaving blades with effortless prowess, striking with control born of unloving strength.*
The Abyssal can use [[Strength]] instead of [[Dexterity]] on attacks with heavy and medium weapons. Such rolls don’t benefit from effects that grant bonus [[Strength]] dots, double successes on [[Strength]] rolls, or replace her [[Strength]] with a higher value.
