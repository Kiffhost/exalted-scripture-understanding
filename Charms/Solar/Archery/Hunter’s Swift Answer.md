The Lawgiver suffers no impunities; with terrific speed and ferocious import, she may answer the blades of her transgressors. When the Solar succeeds at a disengage action, she may unleash a withering or decisive Archery attack from close range, even if she has already attacked that turn. This attack must be directed at the one she broke away from.
