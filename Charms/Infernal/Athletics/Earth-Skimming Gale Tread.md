*Blood-hued winds swirl about the Infernal in an eerily silent vortex, bearing her aloft.*

The Infernal can run on air with her movement actions, letting her move vertically or horizontally. She can’t rise higher than medium range above the ground or a liquid surface. She adds Wind-Born Stride’s bonus dice on all aerial movement rolls, including those made with other Abilities.
This Charm ends if the Infernal stops moving.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has the [[Flight]] feature, she instead doubles 9s and converts [[Wind-Born Stride]]’s bonus dice to non-Charm successes on aerial movement rolls.
### Keys 
#### Sky-Stepping Freedom (2m or 2i per round)
This Charm no longer ends if the Infernal stops moving, and she can hover in place when not moving. There’s no longer a restriction on how high she can ascend. In combat, she must pay two motes or two Initiative at the start of each turn, or she loses this key’s benefits for the rest of the scene.
