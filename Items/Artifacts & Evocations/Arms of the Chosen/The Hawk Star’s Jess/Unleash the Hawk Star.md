## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by a wielder resonant with starmetal. The wielder condenses her bonfire anima into a fistful of light; hurled from the Jess, it manifests the power of the Hawk Star, spreading radiant wings and flying straight at her foe with a shriek of doom. The wielder can expel her bonfire anima when she uses Doom-Gathering Arc to add three Doom to the attack and three automatic successes to the damage roll. This attack deals aggravated damage to creatures of darkness. The Willpower cost of any other Evocations used with Doom-Gathering Arc is waived. This Evocation can only be used once per story. It can be resetbyachievingamajorcharacterorstorygoal(Exalted, p. 170) by defeating a powerful opponent with the Jess.
