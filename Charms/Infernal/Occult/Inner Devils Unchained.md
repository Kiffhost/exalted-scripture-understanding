*The Infernal awakens monsters that lurk in the hearts of men.*

The Infernal transforms a mortal within short range into a First Circle demon, rolling (Manipulation + Occult) against his Resolve if he’s unwilling. An affected character is transformed into a First Circle demon of the Infernal’s choice. He retains his personality, memories, and Intimacies, but uses the demon’s other traits instead of his own. This includes using Charms, but his mote pool begins empty. He has no inherent loyalty to the Infernal and doesn’t count as a bound demon.
With Essence 4, the transformation lasts until the end of the next Calibration.
## [[Keys]]
#### Humanity-Forsaking Horror (Essence 4) (+2xp)
The Infernal can pay a two-experience point surcharge to permanently transform a character, without needing to commit motes. She waives the experience cost the first time she uses this key, and is refunded if the character dies or ceases to be narratively relevant. Such characters don’t count against the limit on how many characters the Infernal can transform. With Essence 5, the Infernal can waive the experience point surcharge once per story.
