Like lightning spilled from the cup of a storm god, the Solar strikes in all directions. Until her next turn, the Solar may counter all incoming attacks exactly as if she were using [[Solar Counterattack]], save for one major differenceâ€”should any of her counterattacks do damage, her [[Initiative]] will not return to its base value until the next round begins. If she does not successfully counter an opponent in the first round, this Charm fades when the second round begins.
