In the dark of night, the Sidereal listens for whispers of disloyalty from her crew. As midnight falls, the Sidereal makes a special ([Charisma or Perception] + Sail) read intentions roll against all characters aboard a ship she pilots or all subordinates within an organization she belongs to. She can also use it when she plays games of chance with such characters, but doing so limits this Charm to those she can perceive. She learns which of them currently poses the greatest threat to her authority if she beats that character’s Guile. For every three extra successes, her player can ask the Storyteller one of the following questions: 
-  How dangerous is the threat he poses? 
-  What Intimacies does he have toward me? 
-  Does he have support from others in the crew or organization? 
-  What’s the least amount of force I could use to make him fall in line? If the Sidereal disciplines that character the following morning, she can use Choosing for Fangs for free.
