*The Solar’s visual acuity is heightened to several times that of a normal mortal.*
This Charm represents an array of mechanical benefits: the Solar may perform difficulty 2 or 3 sight-based actions without a roll. She gains an additional two dice to notice hidden persons or devices, to catch sleight of hand and see through disguises. In dim conditions, she sees as well as in broad daylight. Deeper visual hindrances such as dense smoke or fog represent less of a struggle: reduce the difficulty of seeing in such conditions by 1, and remove the -1 penalty to detect hidden threats in such environments. These effects reflect the Exalt’s ability to notice and process hundreds of minute details, as well as to focus and manage light sources more effectively. The Solar’s visual range is also increased: she can see tiny details at 100 yards, quickly count masses of troops, and notice threats well in advance of her position. 
## Special activation rules
The player may choose to activate [[Keen Sight Technique]] by paying six motes, one willpower. Doing so sets the duration of this Charm to Indefinite. Despite being Simple type [[Charms]], each Keen (Sense) Technique can be activated simultaneously by paying the full cost of each. In addition, these [[Charms]] are compatible with [[Sensory Acuity Prana]] as well as with each other.
