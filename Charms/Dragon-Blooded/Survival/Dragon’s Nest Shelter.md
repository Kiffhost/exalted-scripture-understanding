Calling upon nature’s mercy, the Dragon-Blood fortifies a shelter with the power of the elements. Vines twine around tent poles to secure them in place; the ground beneath a hut compresses itself to form a sturdy foundation; falling snow forms a crystalline shell atop an igloo. This Charm wards an enclosed shelter, such as a cave or hut, that’s large enough to comfortably house herself, her Hearth, and up to ([[Essence]]) other characters. This takes around an hour to complete. This Charm has the aspect of whichever element the Exalt called upon to fortify her shelter. Up to five Dragon-Blooded who know this Charm can cooperate to erect this shelter. Each additional Exalt adds 1 to the effective [[Essence]] of the user to determine the shelter’s maximum size, and allows the shelter to protect against an additional element. Characters within the shelter are protected from [[environmental hazards]] and other wilderness perils related to the chosen element. For example, if the Exalt fortifies a cave with Air [[Essence]], even hurricane winds can’t pass through the cavern mouth, while a shelter fortified with Earth [[Essence]] withstands rockslides and protects those within. This protection doesn’t extend to elemental magic or attacks used by characters. At [[Essence]] 5, if the Dragon-Blooded enhances a shelter while in the bordermarches or middlemarches of the Wyld, it protects its inhabits from any physical or mental effects of the Wyld. It offers no protection once she reaches the deep Wyld.
