*The Exalt feels the air current around her, and senses even the slightest disruption.*
In an enclosed space, such as a burial chamber, or a place where high walls or dense foliage stifle gusts of wind, the Exalt can feel the presence of a hidden person displacing the air around her. Add one automatic success to an [[Awareness]] roll to detect or [[Join Battle]] against such a character.
