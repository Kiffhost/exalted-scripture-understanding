*Hoping for no more than the least she could expect, the Sidereal is unmoved by enticing promises and idealistic visions.*
The Sidereal’s Resolve can’t be reduced below (higher of Essence or 3), except by penalties from Intimacies. If her base Resolve is lower than this, then it instead can’t be reduced below that base value.
If the Sidereal’s Resolve is penalized by an Intimacy of hope, the Intimacy’s penalty is reduced by one.
