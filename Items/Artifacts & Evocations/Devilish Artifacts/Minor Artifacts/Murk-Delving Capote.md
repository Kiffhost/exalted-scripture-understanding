The demon Zabvya, Chorister of Lost Passions, commissioned this glistening dark-green cloak so he could parlay with (and eventually woo) Vathos the Murk-Queen, who dwells forever in the Demon Sea’s lightless depths. Whatever leather comprises the cloak is softer than sealskin, but always reeks of Kimbery’s waters. Nacreous black jade shells line its hood and collar, filtering the Demon Sea’s toxic waters and fumes.

When attuned for two motes, the cloak lets its wearer breathe and speak in water or in acidic or corrosive liquids. She’s immune to harmful effects from exposure to Kimbery’s waters or fumes, though not to any magic that makes use of them, nor to conscious efforts by Kimbery.
