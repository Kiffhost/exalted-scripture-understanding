Many Exalted and other great figures are known across Creation by their titles and epithets, as much if not more than by name. Tepet Ejava is the Roseblack; Yurgen Kaneko is the Bull of the North; Sha’a Oka is the Black Lion. This Merit represents a character whose title carries great weight in her dealings with others. Upon taking this Merit, her player should specify both her character’s sobriquet and the reputation that it carries. Once per story, when she’s awarded a stunt on social influence that benefits from this reputation, she may increase the stunt’s rating by one.
