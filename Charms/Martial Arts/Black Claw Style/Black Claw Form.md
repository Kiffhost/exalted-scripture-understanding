The martial artist slips into a defensive posture, making clear both her unwillingness to fight and her readiness to defend herself regardless. The martial artist adds +1 Evasion, and one success on rolls to disengage or withdraw, reducing the Initiative cost of both actions by one point. If she attacks an enemy who is in close range to another enemy that has a positive Tie towards the martial artist, then the victim of her attack takes a -1 penalty to his Defense, as he fears his allies have begun to turn on him. Enemies who themselves have a positive Tie towards the martial artist also take this penalty, unable to put up a whole-hearted defense. 

## Special activation rules

Whenever the martial artist successfully defends against an attack that causes her attackerâ€™s current Initiative to fall below her own, she may reflexively activate Black Claw Form.
