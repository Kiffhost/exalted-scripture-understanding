The Dragon-Blood moves through the wilderness as its master, running with packs of wild beasts and deftly weaving through jungles. She ignores penalties for crossing difficult terrain made up of dense forests, thick foliage, briar patches, or other plant-based obstructions. While in such terrain, she also ignores the penalty for entering concealment in combat (Exalted, p. 203) and can attempt rushes while in concealment. Additionally, she adds (Essence) non-Charm bonus dice rolls to conceal her tracks. Once per scene, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Wood Aura when she makes an unexpected decisive attack from plant-based concealment to add (Essence) bonus dice on the attack roll and double 10s on the damage roll.
