The Underworld’s behemoths take many forms and rival the strength of Third Circle Demons. Elnuet-that-Was (p. XX) is provided as a ready-made example of a behemoth that a necromancer may bind with this spell.
Storytellers and players wishing to develop their own behemoths might consider the following seeds:
Lamvinult, Whose Mien Is Meat, infects the skin of all they touch so it sloughs off to reveal the still-living muscle beneath and can transform into anyone their plague has afflicted.
Mourning Scour is the vague outline of a maiden in a crystal casket; she knows the regrets of anyone she looks upon and can cry tears of saltwater, arsenic, or blood sufficient to befoul almost any body of standing water.
Umaza (p. XX) is a vast leviathan whose hymns lure the living to certain death or necromantic enlightenment.
