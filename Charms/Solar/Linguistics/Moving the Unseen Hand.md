The Exalt pens a message in a hand so artful and deceptive that she can cause her reader to make an automatic assumption as to the writer’s identity. Upon writing the message, roll ([[Manipulation]] + [[Linguistics]]) with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes to determine the strength of the deception when compared to the target’s [[Resolve]]. To use this Charm, the Exalt must not sign the missive in question; the unsigned letter invites the assumption that allows this Charm to take effect. The Exalt may use this technique in three different ways: She can make readers believe a message was written by a specific person of whom they’re aware—they do not need to know this character on a personal level. She can also make readers assume the letter was written by the person they most want the letter to be from. Lastly, if the Solar has [[Bureaucracy]] 3+, she can make readers assume the letter was written by a hierarchical superior. Despite being a Simple-type Charm, [[Moving the Unseen Hand]] can always be used in combination with its prerequisite; failure to see through [[Stolen Voice Technique]] makes the character automatically subject to Moving the Unseen Hand’s deception.
