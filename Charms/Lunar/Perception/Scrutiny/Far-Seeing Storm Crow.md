TheLunarseesthesecretdoomshangingoverherprey. After successfully using Soul-Piercing Predator Gaze, she rolls (Perception + Lore) to introduce a fact about her target’s weakness, adding her extra successes from the original roll as a non-Charm bonus. This roll can be enhanced by applicable Intelligence Charms. She might reveal that a Dynast’s poor social standing stems from his weak bloodline, that a warrior’s illness was caused by a disease-god’s curse, or that a merchant’s financial ruin is the result of machinations by rivals in a nearby city. The Storyteller can still veto facts that contradict established details of the setting or interfere with the story. If the Lunar knows Scent of Midnight Dweomers, she can introduce facts explaining how her target’s weakness is caused by spirits, sorcery, or other supernatural forces without needing an appropriate Lore background.
