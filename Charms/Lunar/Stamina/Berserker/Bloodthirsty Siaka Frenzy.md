The Lunar’s predatory instincts approach the apex of perfection. She may use Relentless Lunar Fury when she deals decisive damage to a nontrivial foe’s –2 or deeper health levels. When she resets to base Initiative while Relentless Lunar Fury is active, she may pay three motes to add her victim’s current wound penalty to her base Initiative (Incapacitated enemies count as having a –4 penalty). If the attack damaged multiple enemies, she uses the highest single value.
