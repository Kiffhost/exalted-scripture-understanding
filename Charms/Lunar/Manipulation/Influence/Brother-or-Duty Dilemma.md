*The Lunar plays her victim’s passions against his beliefs.*
When an influence roll with any Attribute exploits a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to an individual, her target can’t use a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to a group or a [[Intimacy|Principle]] to bolster his [[Resolve]], or in a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], if its intensity is lower. 
## Protean 

If the exploited [[Intimacy|Tie]] is toward the Lunar’s current shape, her victim can’t use such [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] at all.
