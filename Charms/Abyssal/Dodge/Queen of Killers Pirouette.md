*With a smile and a graceful spin, the Abyssal effortlessly turns her opponent’s blades back to their throats.*
The Abyssal clashes an attack with ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]]). If successful, her enemy’s attack is turned back against him, hitting him automatically and retaining all effects used to enhance the original attack. Any [[Initiative]] a redirected withering attack would grant the attacker goes to the stylist instead.
If the Abyssal knows [[Foe-Shaming Defense]], winning the clash also knocks her enemy prone.
