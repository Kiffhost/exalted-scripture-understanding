*Channeling the spirits of slain steeds, the Abyssal suffuses her mount with swiftness born of sorrow.*
The deathknight converts her mount’s Speed Bonus to non-Charm successes on a mounted movement roll. If her mount’s Speed Bonus is negative, she instead sets it to 0.
A [[Ride]] 5 repurchase lets the Abyssal pay a two-mote surcharge to add her mount’s Speed Bonus to a [[Join Battle]] roll, along with this Charm’s other benefits.
