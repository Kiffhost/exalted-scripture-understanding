*The deathknight’s bearing and composure embody inevitability, staying the hands and tongues of all but her bravest foes.*
Other characters cannot attack the Abyssal or speak against her with any form of social influence. A character can pay one [[Willpower]] to resist this for the scene, but still suffers a penalty of (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) on any threaten rolls he makes against her.
