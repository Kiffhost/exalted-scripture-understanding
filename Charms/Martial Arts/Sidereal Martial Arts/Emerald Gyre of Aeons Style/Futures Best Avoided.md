*Winding her mind through eternity’s gyre, the stylist remembers that which is yet to come.* 
The stylist can use this Charm when she would be disadvantaged due to a surprising event or something she hasn’t noticed: facing a surprise attack, failing an Awareness roll to notice a trap, a thief sneaking past her bedchamber while she’s asleep, etc. It can be used against ambushes, though this doesn’t let the stylist use any other Charms or effects to enhance the roll. She rolls (Intelligence + Lore) against an enemy’s roll or a peril’s difficulty, adding a free full Excellency. Against attacks, this counts as a clash. If successful, she foresees — or rather, remembers — this eventuality in time to defend against it, as though she hadn’t been caught unaware.
This Charm can also be used against threats that are more narrative in nature than an attack or trap, or threats that would disadvantage the stylist even if she succeeds on her roll or doesn’t get a chance to roll. In such cases, the stylist rolls as above, opposing an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll by the relevant character — or the character with the highest such pool, if there are multiple characters. Success lets her player reveal a preparation she’s taken, like waking everyone in her camp before a midnight raid by bandits or taking antivenin in anticipation of being poisoned. The preparation must be something she could have feasibly done in the last few minutes with the materials available to her.
