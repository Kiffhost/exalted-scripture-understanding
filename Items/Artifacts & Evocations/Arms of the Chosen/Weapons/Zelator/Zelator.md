“It has been thirty years since our first failed campaign against the Hexmanse. That such a cabal of bloodsorcerers and devil-loosers could not merely endure the light of the Sun, but even thrive, is an abomination. The lost Deliberative, for all its flaws, for all its failures — perhaps it did not root the sorcerers out, but it kept them underground. Now they exert their will unchecked, and who will fight them but I? “A decade to cut my way free of the devil-world their sorceries banished me to. Another to forge Zelator, a thing to pierce their spells and end their contemptible lives. A third to build alliances, call in favors, raise an army. “Today we ride against Fortis Minor. A month from now, we cross the Grand Sledge and enter the southern Qun-Lun. Within a year we will be at the gates of Shorn, the heads of half the Hexmanse on pikes, the other half ready to fall beneath our hooves, beneath my spear. They will regret their arrogance and their wickedness. That I guarantee.” — Ostra Luka, In the Shadow of the Deliberative Forged by a sorcerer-cataphract to defeat an occult cabal, thedirelanceZelator’slong,narrowbladeisengravedwith an Old Realm character meaning “divine retribution.” The heavy shaft, likewise of orichalcum, bears this Old Realm inscription: “End transgression against the celestial order through harmonious action.” The scarlet tassels are of horsehair from Ostra Luka’s steed, preserved against the millennia by the Art of Permanence. 
 
## Evocations of Zelator

Zelator was forged to defeat witchery. The spear makes baneful attacks against sorcerers, sorcerous constructs, sorcerouslytransformedopponents,andsummonedspirits. Its decisive attacks against such foes add one bonus die to the damage roll and deal aggravated damage. If the target is a sorcerer who has gathered sorcerous motes, three of the gathered motes are dispersed and lost. Centuries of battle have taught Zelator the weaknesses of sorcery. When attempting to counter or distort a spell (Exalted,p.466),thewielderisalwaystreatedasknowing the spell she is attempting to counter or distort. In addition, whenever the Exalt crashes an opponent, she may reflexively either attempt to distort a spell that’s upon him or perform countermagic against a spell that he is casting. If the Exalt has sensed a sorcerous working being enacted in the region (Exalted, p. 489), she may commit one mote for Zelator to point the way toward the site where it is being enacted.
