The Lunar moves with impossible grace that only a shapechanger could achieve, shifting her form and stance to close gaps in her defense. She halves all penalties, rounded down, to her Defense. Against lower-Initiative attackers, she ignores all Defense penalties. This doesnâ€™t affect penalties from surprise attacks.
