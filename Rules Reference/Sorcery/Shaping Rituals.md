Shaping rituals are an abstraction of the many and varied ways a sorcerer or necromancer might gain [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Motes|Sorcerous or Necromantic motes]]. 

#custom/note: shaping rituals do not all have names. Some names of shaping rituals presented here and elsewhere are purely for convenience of file reference.

Shaping rituals attached to a particular archetype may allow access to the other benefits of that archetype, usually in the form of purchasable [[Merits]] or [[Evocations]].

# Mortal Sorcerers and Shaping Rituals
Mortal sorcerers initiate into the Terrestrial Circle by mastering a shaping ritual, which they may purchase as a five-dot Merit that requires [[Occult]] 3. The first spell they learn becomes their control spell. Most mortal sorcerers only ever attain one ritual, but at the Storyteller’s discretion, they might be able to gain more from the same sorcerous archetype, or even different ones

# Multiple Shaping Rituals
The [[Charms]] that initiate the [[Solar Exalted]] into [[sorcery]] also give them a free shaping ritual, which is how most of the Chosen gain access to them. As a Solar sorcerer rises through the three circles, he gains more shaping rituals. These can be taken from rituals offered by his original archetype, but by no means is he limited to those. If the character has used his sorcerous power to make pacts with spirits, create great strongholds of knowledge, or transcend the mental confines of petty humanity, then it’s entirely fitting for him to gain rituals that reflect those achievements.
