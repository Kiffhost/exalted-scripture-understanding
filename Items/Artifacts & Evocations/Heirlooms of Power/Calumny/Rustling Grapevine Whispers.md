*Hidden truths speak through silence.*
The wielder may activate this Evocation whenever she hits or touches another character with [[Calumny]]. The target’s unspoken secrets vibrate up Calumny’s length, whispering a one- or two-word clue to the target’s most potent or most immediately relevant secret, decided by the Storyteller. This adds an automatic success on a read intentions or profile character roll to uncover that secret. Only the wielder hears Calumny’s whispers. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience points. Instead, it awakens at no cost when the wielder whispers a serious or life-changing secret of her own to [[Calumny]]. A Dragon-Blooded Cynis scion may awaken it with an inconvenient secret. 

## Resonant

[[Rustling Grapevine Whispers]] may be used from short range, using shared contact with significant plant-life (e.g., vines, tallgrass, atree) as a medium instead of direct contact.
