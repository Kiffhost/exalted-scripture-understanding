*Dredging up echoes of ancient tongues, Death’s Lawgiver pours over the writings of those long dead.*
The Abyssal can use [[Primeval Tongue Echo]] to read or write in languages she doesn’t know. When reading, she sees seemingly unintelligible scrawls and whorls in place of the actual writing that she nonetheless understands intuitively. When writing, an eerie force guides her hand to trace out unfamiliar letters and characters. Each use lets her read or write a single page of writing.
If the Abyssal knows [[Infinite Blasphemy Glossolalia]], she can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Primeval Tongue Echo]] to write a text in that Charm’s anti-language, manifesting as whirling scrawls like the ones she sees.
