*A moment of creative satori allows the Solar to cleanse her creative vision of all flaws, perfectly attuning her [[Essence]] to that of the unborn wonder she wishes to birth.*
This Charm can be used to supplement a superior or legendary [[Craft]] roll, so that it does not count toward the projectâ€™s terminus. This Charm can be used once per story, but can be reset by completing a superior or legendary project with a goal number of 50+ without use of this Charm.
