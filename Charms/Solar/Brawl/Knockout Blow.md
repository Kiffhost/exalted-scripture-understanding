The Solar sees a perfect opening and strikes a blow, the apex of her attack suffused by battering [[Essence]]. This attack is like a normal withering attack, but the damage is bolstered by doubled 9s. In addition, if the Solar drives her opponent into crash with this attack, he is immediately knocked unconscious. The Solar may further enhance the ferocity of this blow, reflexively paying one mote, one [[Initiative]] per die to add to the damage of this attack, to a limit of the [[Initiative]] gained by the attack. For example, if the Solar rolls four successes on the damage roll, she may spend up to four motes, four [[Initiative]] to add four additional dice to the damage roll. [[Knockout Blow]] can only be used once per fight, but can be reset by dodging, parrying, or soaking a withering attack with three or fewer [[Initiative]] without suffering crash.
