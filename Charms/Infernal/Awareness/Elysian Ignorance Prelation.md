*The Infernal need not concern herself with threats too insignificant to catch her notice.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after being hit with a surprise attack, before the damage roll. A withering attack’s damage is halved, rounded down. Against a decisive surprise attack, the attacker must reroll all successful dice on the damage roll, taking the lower of the two results.

With Essence 3, the Infernal can use this Charm against an ambush, subtracting a success from its damage roll. If she uses it together with [[Threat-Monitoring Excitement]], the penalty increases to her total Defense against the attack, not including any bonuses added by other Charms. This can’t reduce its damage below half the total damage dice, rounded down.
### Keys 
#### Blind God Largesse (Awareness 5, Essence 3)
Once per scene, the Infernal can use this Charm against a non-unexpected attack, turning it into a surprise attack against her. She doesn’t become aware of the attack. She can reset this key by using this Charm against a surprise attack or ambush and taking no damage from it.
