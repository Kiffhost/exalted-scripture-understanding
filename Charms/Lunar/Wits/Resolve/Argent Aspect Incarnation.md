The Lunar embodies the inviolate core of her being, her inchoate [[Essence]] shaped by her most deeply held beliefs.
Upon learning this Charm, the Lunar’s player chooses one of her Defining Principles. She gains the following benefits:  - Her iconic anima and [[Tell]] subtly shift to reflect her Principle. Those who see either intuit that the Lunar has the Principle. If they share it with her, their Principle also counts as a positive Tie to her for the scene unless they pay one [[Willpower]].
 - Once per scene, she waives the [[Willpower]] cost to add an automatic success on an action that aligns with the Principle.
 - When she regains [[Willpower]] from upholding the Principle, she loses one [[Limit]].
 - The Principle counts as a Tie to her Solar mate for purposes of [[Charms]]. It counts as positive or negative if that’s advantageous to her. If she has [[Moon-Follows-Sun Assurance]], its defense isn’t absolute; characters can make a special instill roll, rolling twice and taking the lower result, to suppress that Charm’s protection until the Lunar next gains [[Willpower]] from upholding the Principle.
If the Lunar willingly weakens the Principle, she rolls ten dice and gains [[Limit]] equal to her successes. She loses this Charm’s benefits until the Principle returns to Defining. If she fully erodes the Principle, she can choose a new Defining Principle for this Charm at the end of the story.
