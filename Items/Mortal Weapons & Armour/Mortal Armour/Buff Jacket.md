One of the most common types of armor in the world of Exalted, the buff jacket is a knee-length leather garment typically made from the hide of a mammoth or yeddim.
The front of the coat overlaps completely—the inner and outer layer both fasten at the opposite shoulder. This setup doubles the jacket’s protection across the wearer’s vitals, as well as making it impossible to slip a blade through the seam where the jacket fastens. Most buff jackets have high, overlapping collars as well, to protect the wearer’s neck.
