*The Sidereal stands tall as a legend of the battlefield.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits
- Experienced warriors — battle-hardened soldiers, skilled mercenaries, a nomadic tribe’s horse archers — unconsciously recognize the Sidereal’s skill as a commander. This counts as a Minor Tie of respect. For those who’ve served under the Sidereal’s command in battle, it counts as a Tie of loyalty instead, even if they don’t remember her.
- If a character who’s served under the Sidereal’s command in battle has a negative Tie that applies to her, its intensity is treated as one step lower against her influence. This doesn’t affect Ties toward the Sidereal herself.
- When dealing with warriors, soldiers, and the like, the Sidereal can use War instead of Socialize on read intentions, instill, and persuade rolls.
- The Sidereal adds (War/2, rounded up) dice on Lore rolls involving strategy, military history, or the like.
