*The ground turns to basalt as the Infernal slams her foot down, creeping across streets, walls, and trenches, while foliage and metal turn to tarnished brass.*

This Charm can only be used in an area developed for habitation or use, such as a village, city, or a battlefield where the Infernal benefits from a Fortifications stratagem. The creeping basalt transforms terrain out to medium range. It covers over difficult terrain and hazardous surfaces, smothers flames, and can potentially suppress or remove similar hazards. If she benefits from Fortifications, they still count as difficult terrain for enemies, and subtract successes instead of dice for enemy battle groups.

The Infernal’s senses extend throughout the transformed area. As long as something doesn’t require a roll to perceive, she can observe it as if she were anywhere and everywhere within the area. She can likewise project her voice as if she were at one or more points within the area, potentially negating environmental and distance-based penalties on command actions, influence rolls, and the like.

This transformation fades when this Charm ends, though it may leave cosmetic alterations or damage at the Storyteller’s discretion.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can flurry this Charm with a command action.
## [[Keys]]
#### Hostile Architecture Imposition (War 5)
While within the transformed area, the Infernal can take a miscellaneous action to warp or manipulate its architecture to impede an enemy within it: buckling paved streets, slamming doors, bending walls around them. This can be flurried with a command action. By default, this inflicts a −3 penalty on the next physical roll that character makes, but creative stunts may have other effects, like locking an enemy inside a room, weakening or removing cover, causing a battle group to move the wrong way in response to an order action.
#### Panopticon Realm Infiltration (War 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, this Charm’s range extends to long. The Infernal can make Perception rolls through it, letting her ignore penalties that don’t apply to her remote vantage.
