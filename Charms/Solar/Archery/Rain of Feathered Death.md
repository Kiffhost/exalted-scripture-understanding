The Lawgiver hones her killing prowess, splitting an arrow into a devastating barrage. The Exalt only needs a single arrow to fire this shot; her one arrow splits into multiple arrows and all are directed against a single target. The Solar may split her shot into a maximum of (Dexterity) arrows. If the attack hits, each created arrow hits with a raw damage equal to the Solarâ€™s current Initiative minus her successes on each damage roll. Therefore, if she rolls 10 damage dice and gains two successes on the first roll, the second roll will feature eight damage dice. If that gains four successes, her third damage roll will be four dice. If the Exalt runs out of damage dice due to successful hits, her created arrows cannot do less than (Essence) damage each.
