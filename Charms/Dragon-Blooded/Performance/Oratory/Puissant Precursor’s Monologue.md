The Dragon-Blood speaks with the undeniable authority of a revered grandmother, her every word as powerful as a bolt of lightning. She makes a persuade roll with ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance), doubling 7s, to convince her audience to take a course of action that upholds one of her Defining Principles. Characters who share that Intimacy with her must pay an additional point of Willpower to resist her influence. This Charm can only be used once per story unless reset by achieving a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) that upholds one of her Defining Principles.
