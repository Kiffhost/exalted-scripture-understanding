*The Abyssal moves before she knows why, guided by her preternatural instinct for danger.*
The Abyssal can dodge an ambush or a similar unseen peril. Her base Evasion is set to 2, but she adds +1 for every 1 and 2 on the attack roll (or comparable roll for other hazards). If this raises her Evasion to its normal base value, she may use other [[Dodge]] [[Charms]] against the ambush.
