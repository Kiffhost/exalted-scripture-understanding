The Lunar becomes a mirror wherein others glimpse their hearts’ desires. After successfully asserting Guile against a read intentions roll with at least a single 1, the Lunar may use this Charm, causing the opposing character to believe he succeeded. However, instead of the truth, he sees whatever he’d most desire to see. A merchant prince recruiting caravan guards might see absolute loyalty to anyone who can pay sufficiently, while a Dragon-Blooded chasing rumors of an Anathema might believe the Lunar both knows the Anathema’s true identity and is eager to aid him.
