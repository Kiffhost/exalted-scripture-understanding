*Her eyes opened by death’s caress, the Abyssal knows well the signs that herald the dead.*
The Abyssal can sense when one of the undead or a creature of darkness is within range of her senses, even if he’s dematerialized. This manifests through eerie visions and omens: disjointed flashes of a ghost’s dying memories, the smell of blood and grave dirt clinging to a hungry ghost, a spectral choir chanting to herald a fellow Abyssal’s presence.
Guided by these visions, the Abyssal adds ([[Occult]]) dice on [[Perception]]-based rolls involving the undead, except for attack rolls and extended actions.
An [[Occult]] 3 repurchase extends this Charm’s effects to all spirits and fae.
[[Whispers]]: Against characters with [[Whispers]], the Abyssal adds successes instead of dice.
