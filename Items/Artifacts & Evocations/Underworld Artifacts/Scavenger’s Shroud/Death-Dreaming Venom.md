*The walkure are born from dreams of death. Drawing threads of these dreams from the Shroud, its wearer unleashes a soul-numbing poison.*
The wearer suffuses a decisive attack using any weapon with a venomous dream, with Damage 3i/round, duration (wearer’s [[Larceny]] or [[Stealth]]). and a −2 penalty, which subtracts successes instead of dice on [[Perception]]-based rolls.
If the wielder uses this Evocation on a surprise attack, it inflicts a two-success penalty on her victim’s roll against the poison, while an ambush denies him the chance to roll at all.
## Dissonant
Surprise attacks subtract two dice from the victim’s roll, not successes, while ambushes subtract two successes.
