*The Exalt who dons this armor becomes aware that battle is only a means to progress along a path, not an end unto itself.*
Once she takes one step toward the end of the fight, the next follows easily, so long as she does not falter. The first Evocation of [[Freedom’s Cadence]] grants the wearer (greater of [[Essence]] or three, maximum five) bonus dice on any attack or social influence action she takes against an opponent that she gained [[Initiative]] Break for Crashing, as long as that opponent is still in [[Initiative]] Crash. However, if the opponent achieves an [[Initiative]] Shift on the Exalt, she instead takes a penalty of ([[Essence]]) dice on any such action she takes against that opponent while she is in [[Initiative]] Crash.
