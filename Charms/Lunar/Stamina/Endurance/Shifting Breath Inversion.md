*The Lunar reshapes her anatomy, opening gills to brave the depths or growing lungs within a sea monster’s form.*
She may breathe in any environment, and is immune to harm based on environmental pressure (or lack thereof). She adds ([[Essence]]) successes on rolls to resist poisons whose sole vector is inhalation. Note that many aquatic animals are ill-suited to moving on land even if they can breathe air, treating it as difficult terrain. The Lunar may circumvent this by growing [[Extra Limbs]] with [[Perfected Hybrid Interaction]] (p. XX), or with other appropriate magic. 
## Protean 

In amphibious animal shapes, the Lunar adds these successes on rolls to resist any inhaled poison, even if it has other vectors. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape can breathe water may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm, with [[Dauntless]] Yeddim Caravan (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
