In the throes of a harrowing performance, the Solar is wracked with the zeal-fired alleluias of a revival. The Solar may activate this Charm when she has 10+ motes committed to sustaining other scene-length Charms. While this Charm is active, every time she attempts a social influence action of any kind, she gains a mote of Essence. In addition, for every two minutes she spends in performance, she gains a mote. Finally, the Exalt gains a mote of Essence for every 10 she rolls on a Performance action against a difficulty of at least 4, to a maximum of three 10derived motes per action.
