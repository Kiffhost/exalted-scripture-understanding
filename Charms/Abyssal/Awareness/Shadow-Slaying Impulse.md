The deathknight deprives her foes of the shadows’ safety,
forcing them into the open.
The Abyssal reflexively makes a decisive attack
against a concealed enemy that she’s aware of. If she
hits, her enemy is driven from his current hiding spot
to a new one and must roll (Dexterity + Stealth) to
maintain his concealment as usual. He can reflexively
move one range band if necessary to do so, but this uses
his movement action for the round. If there aren’t any
other hiding spots he can reach, his concealment is
broken automatically.

*The Abyssal’s unwavering focus casts aside the frailty of mortal limitation.*
This Charm upgrades Superior (Sense) Focus and must be purchased separately for each set of senses. While using Superior (Sense) Focus to enhance the chosen set of senses, the deathknight gains additional benefits
- The range at which she can make out fine sensory detail is further extended: one mile for vision or hearing or (Essence/2, rounded up) miles for scent.
- Instead of reducing sensory penalties by one, she halves them, rounded down.
- When she makes a (Perception + Awareness) roll using an enhanced sense, she reduces the cost of any instant-duration Awareness Charms she uses to enhance it by one mote each. If all five of her senses currently benefit from this Charm, she gains this discount on all Awareness rolls, including Join Battle.
- While using Awful Clarity Insight, she rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on Awareness rolls using the enhanced sense.
