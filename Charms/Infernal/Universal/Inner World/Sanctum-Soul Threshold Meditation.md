*The Infernal vanishes into her inner world, exploring the depths of her soul.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after a scene spent meditating to enter her inner world physically. Within it, the bonus to her mote recovery increases to five and she adds (higher of Essence or 3) automatic successes on rolls to introduce facts about her inner world. She can reshape her reality by actively introducing facts in mid-scene. She can use this Charm a second time to return, appearing in the same place she left.

Other characters can attempt a difficulty 7 (Perception + {Awareness, Investigation, Occult, or Survival) roll to detect a trace of the Infernal’s presence where she left. They can wait for her to return, or use magic like [[Shattered Gates of Heaven]] (p. XX) to intrude on the inner world. If another characters ends up stranded in the inner world, he can find a way back with an (Attribute + Ability) roll that fits his attempted escape at difficulty 5. If he fails, he must spend another hour seeking escape before he can roll again.
### Keys
#### Soul-Haven Invocation (Essence 3) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to bring up to (Essence x2) willing characters into the inner world with her.
#### Embrace of Hellish Paradise (Essence 4, [[#Soul-Haven Invocation (Essence 3) (+1wp)|Soul-Haven Invocation]]) (+10m)
The Infernal can pay an additional ten-mote surcharge when she uses [[#Soul-Haven Invocation (Essence 3) (+1wp)|Soul-Haven Invocation]] to bring a number of characters equivalent to a Size (Essence) battle group with her (Exalted, p. 206).
