The Sidereal has sworn upon the Sword and the pitiless Maiden who wields it, vowing to die before forsaking her duty to Creation. When a persuade roll or other influence would cause the Sidereal to act against a Major or Defining Intimacy, her oath calls down a doom to stay her hand. She suffers unavoidable lethal damage equal to the Willpower cost to resist the influence. The Storyteller chooses what form this takes: being hit by a stray arrow mid-battle, coughing up blood, being struck by lightning, etc. Using this Charm terminates the offending influence and lets the Sidereal roll (Intimacy) dice, losing Limit equal to her successes. Reset: Once per story unless reset by upholding a Defining Intimacy of that opposes the rejected influence or a Major or Defining Intimacy of loyalty or duty. Reckoners can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect. The Scripture of the Expectant Maiden Once, there was a maiden… ...who was always looking forward to the way things would be. She said, “Someday, I’m getting out of this place.” “Someday, I’m going to kill that boy that put me here.” “And while I wait, I don’t much mind,” “’cause it’s better to dream tomorrow than to be there.” “I’m holding at bay,” she said, “what I know to be true.” “That I’ll never get out. I won’t let my dreams die!” “I’ll hang on to hope,” she said, “until Time itself ends. But—” “There’s always an ending,” said Time.
