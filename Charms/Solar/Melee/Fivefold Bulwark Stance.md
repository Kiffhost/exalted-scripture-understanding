Accepting no form of defeat, the Solar gazes along the edge of her blade and sees what it would see. The ebb and flow of battle becomes clear to her; she sees the arcs of incoming attacks as glowing trails of Essence, and moves with impossible, fluid speed to strike the path of all harm. For a full scene, the Exalt may ignore certain penalties to her Parry Defense and reduce the cost to use Bulwark Stance by two motes and Dipping Swallow Defense by one. In addition, when she uses Dipping Swallow Defense, it raises her Parry Defense by one.
