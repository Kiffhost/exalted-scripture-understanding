*The Lawgiver is attuned to her subconscious, and is preternaturally aware of her surroundings.*
If the Exalt possesses this Charm, she feels an instinct each time she encounters a scene in which a case scene or profile character action (p. 224) should be used. At this point, the Storyteller informs the player which action is appropriate, and vaguely why—if danger is present, the player is informed that the Solar senses a trap and should use a case scene action; if there is a suspicious character, the player is made aware of that character so that a profile action can be used. This Charm does not entail automatic success at each prospective action. It merely informs the player which action should be performed, and why. As the Solar notices many things the player does not, this Charm can be used to generate reasons for investigations it would otherwise be impossible for a normal character to perceive.
