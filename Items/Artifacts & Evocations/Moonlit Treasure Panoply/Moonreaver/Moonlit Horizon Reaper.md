*Fleeting rifts trail behind Moonreaver’s edge like an afterimage, a flickering ribbon of otherworldly moonlight.*
The wielder gains the following benefits:
 - The cold that emanates from the rifts is an environmental hazard with difficulty ([[Strength]]) and Damage 1L/round, extending out to short range from the wielder. Those damaged by it are penalized as per [[Cold Breath of the Moon]].
 - Enemies who hit the wielder with an unarmed attack or spend a round grappling her suffer one die of decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]].
Those damaged by it are penalized as per [[Cold Breath of the Moon]].
 - Against enemies affected by [[Cold Breath of the Moon]], damage dice added by subsequent uses of that Evocation are converted to automatic successes.
 - Arrows vanish into the rifts, scattering across the othermoon. When an enemy makes a ranged attack against her, 1s on the attack roll subtract successes.
## Resonant
On the wielder’s turn, she can reflexively banish all trivial enemies within close range to the othermoon, where they’re incapacitated by cold almost immediately. She may choose to have any survivors return once the scene ends.
## Dissonant
The wielder must pay one [[Initiative]] on each of her subsequent turns to maintain this Evocation.
