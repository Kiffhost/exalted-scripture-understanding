*The Abyssal’s prowess exceeds that of artisans fettered by mortal lifespans, a master of countless crafts.*
When the Abyssal learns this Charm, each dot she has in a [[Craft]] Ability grants her an additional dot that she may place in another [[Craft]] Ability with a lower or equal rating. Likewise, each [[Craft]] dot the Abyssal purchases with experience grants another dot that can be assigned to a [[Craft]] with an equal or lower rating.
