*Armies fall screaming before the Abyssal’s terrible might.*
The Abyssal makes a decisive attack against all enemies within close range, rolling (Initiative/2, rounded up) dice of decisive damage against each hit enemy.
Against trivial enemies, she rolls her full Initiative and ignores Hardness.
With Essence 5, this Charm’s cost is reduced by one mote.
With an Essence 5 repurchase, if the Abyssal incapacitates at least one enemy with this Charm, she may pay six motes, one anima, and two Initiative to reflexively make a withering attack against all enemies within close range. She gains full Initiative from the highest damage roll but can’t gain more than three Initiative from other damage rolls (this doesn’t include Initiative Breaks for crashing enemies). If she crashes at least one enemy with this attack, she may use Glorious Carnage Typhoon again reflexively to make a decisive attack again, as above.
