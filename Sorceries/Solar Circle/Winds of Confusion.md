*The sorcerer whispers the secret name of the hurricane that formed where Hell’s first stars were unmade, blowing a black wind of mind-death.*

Purplish-black air blows from behind the sorcerer, creating a wind corridor that’s one mile wide and five miles long. It extends up to medium range vertically. The wind isn’t impeded by any mundane materials unless they’re completely airtight. Other characters exposed to the wind slowly lose their mental faculties. At the start of each of their turns, they must make a difficulty 5 (Intelligence + Integrity) roll. Characters who fail are addled, temporarily lowering their Intelligence and permanent Willpower by one dot, to a minimum of 0. This reduction applies for all purposes, including Charm calculations, with the exception of meeting Attribute minimums for Charms or similar effects. If a character’s permanent Willpower is reduced below their current temporary Willpower, they lose any excess points. The sorcerer is completely immune to the wind.

This reduction is cumulative for characters who fail multiple times, quickly eliminating the minds of all but the most resilient. A character whose effective Intelligence or Willpower is reduced to 0 becomes completely unaware of the world. Such characters stand, sit, or lie in a comatose state. They wake from this torpor if they’re damaged or otherwise harmed. However, this doesn’t restore the reduced traits, and they’re unable to use or comprehend language for this spell’s duration.

Once the spell ends, reduced values return at a rate of one dot per hour.
# Control
The sorcerer’s breath smells sweet and causes momentary dizziness for those who breathe it in deeply. When a character’s Intelligence or Willpower is reduced to zero, the sorcerer may choose to put them in a mindless trance, rather than rendering them comatose. They wander mindlessly, unaware of their surroundings or identity. The sorcerer can use social influence to command them, and they count as having as a Major Intimacy that supports any influence she uses. However, they cannot manage tasks more complicated than what a common working animal could understand.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 20)
The sorcerer is no longer immune to the wind.
