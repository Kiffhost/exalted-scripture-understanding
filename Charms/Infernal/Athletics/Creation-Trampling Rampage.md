*The Infernal’s fury levels cities and shatters mountains, exacting retribution on a faithless world.*

The Infernal makes two rolls for a feat of strength and adds her successes together. She only needs to pay a Charm’s cost once to enhance both rolls. If it’s a feat of demolition that supports a Major or Defining Intimacy, she makes three rolls and keeps the highest two.

If the Infernal succeeds, she gains one Willpower. If the feat supported an Intimacy, it’s strengthened by one step, and she can’t voluntarily weaken it until she next fails a feat of strength. If she fails, she rolls (Essence + Strength) dice and gains Limit equal to her successes.
## Special activation rules
If the Infernal uses this Charm together with Infinite Might Expansion, she waives its most cost and the once-per-scene limit.
