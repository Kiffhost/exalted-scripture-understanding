The Lunar’s visage lingers in onlookers’ memories, whispering terror and temptation. She resets a failed persuade or bargain roll to seduce a single target, or a failed threaten roll against a single target. If the target uses the same Intimacy that he did against the first roll to bolster his Resolve against her renewed roll, its Resolve bonus is reduced by one. This Charm can only be used once per scene. Protean: If the Lunar uses this Charm to reset a seduction attempt in a human shape her target has a Major or Defining Tie of lust, love, etc., toward, or resets a threaten attempt in any shape he has a Major or Defining Tie of fear toward, he also suffers −2 Resolve against the renewed roll.
