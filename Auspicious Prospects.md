Each Caste has an Auspicious Prospects for (Caste) power that divines how certain events or developments relate to destiny’s plan. If an event would help ensure destiny comes to pass, and the Sidereal does something meaningful to ensure that event happens, she fulfills that auspicious prospect. The same is for thwarting something contrary to destiny. Fulfilling an auspicious prospect grants one Willpower, subtracts one Limit, and grants a Role Bonus (p. XX).

Not everything is accounted for by destiny. If an event doesn’t matter one way or the other, there’s no auspicious prospect to fulfill, but the Sidereal can intervene in the matter as she sees fit without having to fear any repercussions within the Bureau of Destiny — at least, not for official reasons. This is almost always the case for events involving the actions of the Exalted and other powerful beings (p. XX).

If the Storyteller doesn’t have a particular answer in mind, he should pick whatever result best serves the story. Revealing an auspicious prospect can introduce a plot hook for player characters to follow up on or a narrative complication to contend with, while a neutral result gives players license to make bold decisions.
