Even when those maimed by the Lunar’s claws escape her, their wounds remind them that the hunt isn’t over. Characters that suffer a crippling injury inflicted by the Lunar count as having a Minor Tie of fear toward her until it fully heals. If the injury is a severed limb or comparable maiming, it counts as a Major Tie instead. The Lunar adds (Essence) dice on threaten rolls with any Attribute against such characters. Receiving an artifact or other magical prosthetic replacement for a maimed limb counts as healing it for this Charm’s purposes. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has a threaten or intimidate dice pool may learn this as a Charisma Charm, with Endless Nightmare Hunt (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
