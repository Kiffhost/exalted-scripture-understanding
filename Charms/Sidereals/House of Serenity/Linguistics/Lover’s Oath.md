The Sidereal and her partner twist the ends of a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Bride around their fingers; as they exchange promises, the prayer strip splits and shrivels into two starmetal rings set with sapphires. The Sidereal binds herself to a willing partner, each of whom must have a positive Defining Tie toward the other. So long as they both wear their starmetal rings, they gain the following benefits: 
-  Their Ties to each other can’t be weakened or altered, except by a partner voluntarily weakening her own Ties or eroding other partners’ Ties toward her. 
-  They can sense each other’s emotional state and general circumstances. 
-  They can pay each other’s mote and Willpower costs. Spirits and other characters whose mote pools are significantly larger than the Exalted’s can’t pay mote costs. 
-  When one partner would take damage or suffer harmful effects, his partner may choose to suffer it in his stead. 
-  Other characters can’t remove the rings unless their efforts benefit from magic. The rings are nigh-indestructible, like artifacts. The Sidereal can end this Charm without breaking this partnership, leaving the rings intact. She can subsequently use this Charm to empower them again without her partner needing to be present, even if one or both no longer has the requisite Tie. She may end a partnership if she chooses, shattering both rings. The Sidereal can bond with multiple partners. She can’t take a new partner without each other partners’ assent unless she breaks her bond with the dissenters.
