An icy wind heralds the arrival of Glacial Mantle’s master and her army, plunging the battlefield into an unseasonable winter. This Evocation creates a unique magical stratagem with threshold 3. If successful, upon Joining Battle, heavy snowfall, sleet, or hail descends upon the battlefield, inflicting a −2 environmental penalty on enemies’ ranged attacks, movement actions, and vision- or hearing-dependent Awareness rolls. Additionally, the intense cold increases any withering damage dealt by allied battle groups by one point. This damage bonus doesn’t apply against characters immune to environmental penalties.
## Dissonant
This Evocation’s penalties only apply against enemy battle groups.
