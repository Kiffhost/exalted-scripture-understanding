Drawing on ancient wisdoms and forbidden secrets, the Lunar may uncover flaws hidden in sorcerers’ curses or divine miracles. After encountering the ongoing effects ofaspiritCharmoraspell,sherolls(Intelligence+[Lore or Occult]) to introduce a method by which that magic may be undone. This roll is opposed by the character who created the effect, using an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) combination. If successful, the Lunar’s player and the Storyteller should work together to determine a way that she can end the magic. The effort required to do so should be commensurate with the effect’s strength. This can’t reverse Instant-duration effects, or magic used by Essence 10 beings. If the Lunar breaks a magical effect with this Charm, the opposing character becomes aware of it, sensing the affront to his primacy. An Intelligence 5, Essence 4 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a one-Willpower surcharge to introduce a way to permanently undo a Terrestrial sorcerous working, or temporarily suppress a Celestial or Solar working long enough for her to accomplish a significant task.
