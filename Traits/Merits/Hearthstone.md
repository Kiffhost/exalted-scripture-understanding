This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
This Merit bestows ownership of a hearthstone—a gem formedofconcentratedgeomanticEssence,bearingpotent magical powers. Most hearthstones radiate broad mystical benefits into the region surrounding them, but some rarer stones have more concentrated or direct powers, or even hide a handful of potent Evocations within their depths.
MosthearthstonesaredeliberatelyformedthroughEssence concentration in manses, but a few hearthstones naturally form in demesnes or at sites where Essence has worked prodigiousmiraclesupontheland.Ifahearthstoneislinked to a manse, and the manse’s owner places the hearthstone in a specially-designed socket in an attuned artifact, then the character enjoys the benefits of standing within the manse wherever she goes (see the Manse Merit, p. 163).
Two dots in this Merit represents the power of most hearthstones in Creation, while four dots provides a greater hearthstone from an exceptionally powerful manse or demesne.
Hideous (0 dots)—Innate This Merit has no cost, and may be taken for free.
The character is memorably ugly, possibly as a result of overt deformity, disfiguring scars, inhuman mutations, or just being born that way. His Appearance does not measure how attractive he is; instead, the more dots of Appearance he has, the more intimidatingly horrid he looks. The character adds his Appearance bonus (p. 218) to attempts to threaten or intimidate, rather than to instill and persuade actions.
### Drawback
The character subtracts his Appearance rating from most seduction attempts.
