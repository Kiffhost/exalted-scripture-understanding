The Lunar may pay a four-mote surcharge when she uses [[Lodestone Reckoning Manner]] to intuit hidden shortcuts and anticipate unforeseen delays. She and up to ([[Essence]] x2) companions increase the speed at which they travel along the charted course to 20 miles per day across normal terrain, 10 miles per day across harsh wilderness, or (Speed x4) miles per hour for ships. Mounts don’t count toward the limit on companions. This Charm only enhances naval travel if the Lunar helms the ship and there are no more than ([[Essence]] x2) other characters aboard. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is migratory can learn this as a [[Perception]] Charm.
