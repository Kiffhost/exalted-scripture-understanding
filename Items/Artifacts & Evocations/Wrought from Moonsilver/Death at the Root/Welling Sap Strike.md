*Where the bark is cut, sweet life flows out.*
After dealing damage with a decisive attack or successfully using [[Sever the Flow]], the wielder gathers geomantic [[Essence]] from her surroundings into a shining corona around the [[Grimcleaver]], adding one die to the raw damage and Overwhelming of its withering attacks. The wielder can stack this Evocation up to ([[Essence]]) times. In a demesne or manse, this increases to (its Merit rating), if higher. In N/A-rated demesnes and manses, it can be stacked without limit.
