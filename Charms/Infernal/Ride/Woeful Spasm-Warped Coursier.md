*The Infernal’s steed is twisted and remade in the Chrysalis Grotesque, emerging as a monstrous thing better suited to Hell’s agonies.*

The Infernal spins a Chrysalis Grotesque around a willing mount. After a day, it emerges, transformed. It gains six dots of mutations, representing demonic features: brazen plates like scales, green flame that spits from its mouth, crystalline wings like those of the agata, and similar transformations. Additionally, when the Infernal rides it, it adds an automatic successes on attack rolls, movement actions, feats of demolition, and threaten rolls, and gains +1 Defense.

The Infernal can use this Charm a second time, waiving its Willpower and experience costs, to change the mutations possessed by a mount. It requires only a scene within the Chrysalis Grotesque. Otherwise, a mount can only benefit from this Charm once.

This Charm’s experience cost is waived the first time the Infernal uses it. It’s refunded if the transformed mount is slain.
