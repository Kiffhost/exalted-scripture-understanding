When the pain of parting is too much to bear, [[Fond Remembrance]] offers the mercy of a clean cut.
When a character spends [[Willpower]] to see through a false memory, the Lunar can reflexively use MindBlanking Fear Technique (Lunars, p. 226) to erase all his memories of her, real and fake. This Evocation doesn’t alert the Lunar to the fact that the character resisted.
Against trivial characters, the Charm’s cost is waived and it succeeds automatically.
