*The deathknight and her pale steed fight as one, riding down their foes with murderous focus.*
While the Abyssal is mounted, she can transfer up to half her [[Initiative]], rounded up, to her steed, or allow her steed to do the same for her. This can be used to make and defend against attacks, but must be declared before the roll, as usual.
