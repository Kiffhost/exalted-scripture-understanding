*When fighting blind, the Solar’s second sight rises to see through the [[Essence]] of the world, momentarily revealing her target’s location and allowing her to strike.*
During combat, the Exalt may use this Charm on her turn to strike at a hidden foe within range. If this attack is successful, it does not knock her opponent out of stealth unless he’s incapacitated by the blow. Instead, it forces him to change hiding places, making him subject to the penalty for moving in [[Stealth]] (p. 204). If the target can find a different hiding place without changing range bands, this does not use up his movement action for the turn.
