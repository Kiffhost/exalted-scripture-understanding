*Arcs of deathly white Essence swirl around the Hungry Ghost master as she opens her lower soul’s spiritual maw to consume her foes.*
To use this [[Charm]], the stylist must have [[Initiative]] 12+. She makes a decisive attack against an enemy with lower Initiative, adding dice of damage equal to the difference between their Initiative ratings, up to a maximum of the stylist’s Initiative. If she has a relevant [[Intimacy]] of primal emotion, she adds ([[Essence]] + [[Intimacy]]) to her effective Initiative to determine both the bonus and the maximum damage she can add.
This soul-destroying attack is especially potent against living enemies and ghosts, dealing aggravated damage. If such an enemy is incapacitated, the stylist devours his higher soul, gaining (his [[Essence]]) motes. If she slays one of the living, his lower soul will always rise as a hungry ghost (Exalted, p. 503) the next time the sun sets unless he’s put to rest with magic like the [[Zenith]] Caste anima. These revenants have a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of terrified obedience toward the martial artist.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by crashing an enemy whose [[Initiative]] was higher than the stylist’s.
## Mastery
When the stylist consumes an enemy’s soul, she may incur [[Experience Debt]] to instantly learn a single Martial Arts Charm or [[Eclipse]] Charm that he knew, as long she meets all its usual prerequisites.
She can likewise learn necromantic spells she qualifies for, though not sorcerous ones. She can’t learn Sidereal Martial Arts this way unless she devours a Sidereal’s soul.
## Terrestrial
This Charm can only be used against crashed enemies.
