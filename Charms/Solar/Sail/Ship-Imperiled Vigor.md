The Lawgiver has weathered storms and faced many crises on the open sea. With this Charm, the Exalt is quickened by peril and reacts to disaster with unhesitating action. When the vessel she is aboard has taken hull damage, the Exaltgainsanumberofbonusdiceequaltothe hull penalty. For example, if the hull penalty is -1, the Solar gains +1 to certain actions. These bonus dice can be applied to any action in defense of the ship or its crew, from combat to social influence to rolls to repair damage to the ship and stop its sinking. These bonus dice cannot be applied to Naval Maneuvers or pursuit rolls, although they do apply to [[Sail]] rolls to avoid hazards and navigate to a destination.
