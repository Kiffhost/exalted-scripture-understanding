Water is the flow of Creation, descending from Heaven and travelling to the corners of the world. It clings to neither shape nor form, shifting and changing to adapt to its surroundings. It’s not stopped by dams, but merely diverted, finding another path to the goal it inexorably seeks. It needs only the slightest crack to permeate any barrier, and with time, it will wear the mountains down to dust. Its depths conceal many things, whether the glinting treasures of sunken ships or the unseen menace of the riptide.

Exaltation as a Water Aspect breaks down fixed and stagnant ways, suffusing the Dragon-Blood with the mercurial adaptability of water. She learns to see things from many perspectives, pursuing countless paths until she finds the one that leads to victory. If conventional methods prove unsuccessful, she tries the unconventional. If honorable means are unavailing, then underhanded ones must be employed. Challenge and conflict is the wellspring of all growth, and the only sin is conceding failure.

The Children of Danaa’d navigate the treacherous waters of uncharted seas, government bureaucracies, and criminal underworlds with equal ease, unstymied by seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Every battle is a chance to learn and grow, whether it’s adapting one’s fighting style to counter that of a superior opponent or drilling green troops in battle strategy through practical experience. Every social interaction is one step closer towards accomplishing their goals or schemes, even if they may not understand how at first. Their dogged persistence sees them to the end of unraveling mysteries, solving academic challenges, or resolving social disputes.

A Water Aspect shares her persistence with her Sworn Kin, helping them to adapt and grow stronger in the face of adversity. When her Hearthmates would resign themselves to failure or fall into despair, it’s she who encourages them to find wisdom from their defeat. Within Dragon-Blooded societies, they’re problem solvers who offer practical solutions to all difficulties, great and small. Conflict, be it military, political, or economic, is a chance to move forward, and they guide their people through times of trouble to see the other shore, or instigate such competitions when necessary to avoid stagnation.


# Aspect Markings

Water Aspects tend toward a slight bluegreen tint to their skin, sometimes a deep green-black or ebony in those of refined pedigrees. They can smell of fresh running water, salty ocean spray, or of the earth after rainfall. Some are marked by watery eyes or perpetually damp hair. Their clothing might billow as though soaked in water, and their presence can leave surfaces covered in condensation. 

# Anima Banner

Water Aspect animas are dark blue, tinged with green or black, rippling like pools of water or rolling like ocean waves. Some give off the roar of the pounding surf crashing to shore, while other are accompanied by an eerie silence like the stillness of the ocean depths. Their iconic animas swell into impressive displays of water dragons, whirlpools, tsunamis, schools of fish, or siaka and other great sea beasts.

# Anima Effects

Water Aspects move with fluid grace, and are as at home beneath the water as they are on dry land (p. 155). 
- For five motes, the Water Aspect may use her move action to cross the surface of water as though it were solid land, and ignores the −3 penalty for rushing or disengaging across difficult terrain. She gains these benefits for free while at bonfire.
- For three motes, the Water Aspect adds a nonCharm success on a roll to disengage, withdraw, or resist being grappled. 
- Water Aspects may breathe water as though it were air, and suffer no penalties for being submerged in water.

# Great Curse Manifestation

A Water Aspect’s Great Curse makes her perseverance a liability as she goes to unnecessary extremes to overcome obstacles or protect allies, or faces down impossible obstacles refusing to believe she can be defeated. She might take any underhanded shortcut or employ any plans, no matter how convoluted, in the pursuit of her own triumph.
