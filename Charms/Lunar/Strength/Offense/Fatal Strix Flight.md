The Lunar graces her victim with the gift of flight. When she uses [[Mighty [[Ram]] Smash]] (p. XX) from close range, she may pay a four-mote, one-[[Initiative]] surcharge to launch her victim vertically instead of horizontally. The extra damage added by [[Mighty [[Ram]] Smash]] is replaced by falling damage (Exalted, p. 232) as her victim plummets back to earth.
