*The deathknight savors the exquisite pleasure of agony, drawing power from pain.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after being hit by a decisive attack, but before the damage roll. She gains one mote for every die on the damage roll that rolls a success. This includes dice that are rerolled into failures with [[Far Beyond Ruin]] or similar defensive magic, but she doesn’t gain additional motes if rerolled dice succeed again.
The Abyssal can’t gain more than ([[Stamina]]) motes per round from this Charm. With [[Resistance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, this increases to ([[Stamina]] x2).
With a [[Resistance]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm for two [[Initiative]] to exchange four motes from it for one [[Willpower]]. (Exchanged motes still count toward the maximum).
With a [[Resistance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm for one [[Willpower]] to exchange motes for [[Initiative]].
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by being hit by a decisive attack with 10+ damage dice without being damaged.
