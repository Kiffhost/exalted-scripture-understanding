*The deathknight judges a soul’s worthiness to serve.*
The Abyssal makes a ([[Perception]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) read intentions rolls against a member of an organization, adding ([[Essence]]) automatic successes. Success reveals the strongest Tie he holds towards it.
She succeeds automatically against characters who don’t use magic to resist or who have less temporary [[Willpower]] than her.
With a [[Bureaucracy]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm to discern Ties towards organizations she belongs to, rather than her target. She only succeeds automatically against characters whose permanent [[Willpower]] is lower than her own, even if they don’t use magic.
