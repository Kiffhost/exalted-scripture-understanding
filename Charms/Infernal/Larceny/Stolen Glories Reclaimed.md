*The Infernal thief’s audacity rivals that of the gods, who stole Creation from its makers.*

The Infernal adds (Essence) dice and rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on a Larceny roll for pickpocketing and other forms of theft. If she has an Intimacy that would support stealing something, she also gains this bonus on Awareness, Bureaucracy, and Investigation rolls to detect, examine, or appraise it.
## [[Keys]]
#### Audacious Villain Heist (Larceny 4, Essence 2) (3m)
The Infernal can pay three motes when she rolls to steal something to automatically succeed against opposing Awareness rolls unless they’re enhanced by magic. She can’t do so for objects that are currently in use or attuned artifacts. Onlookers who fail their roll can’t notice the object’s absence for at least (Infernal’s Essence) minutes, unless they directly discover it — for instance, when a mercenary goes to draw his stolen sword.
