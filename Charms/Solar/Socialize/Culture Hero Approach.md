This Charm allows the Solar to make a special read intentions action while observing an unfamiliar ritual to discern its purpose. This action has a difficulty of the obscurity of the ritual, and can be lowered by a relevant Lore rating. For example, an expert on the Skullstone Archipelago could interpret the ritual of bone and ivory more easily than someone who has never visited Onyx. This Charm can also pick up ritual subtexts: an expert in cults might recognize a demon-worshiping dance disguised as a harvest ritual. Basic success on this roll tells the Solar the meaning of the ritual. For every two additional successes, she understands an additional one-sentence fact about the ritual. If she is expected to perform the ritual, each fact she uncovers in this manner amounts to a single automatic success on a Performance roll to participate.
