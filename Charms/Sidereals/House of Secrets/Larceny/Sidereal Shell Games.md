*Running her fingers through the weave of fate and crossing her wrists, the Sidereal switches strands of fate between herself and an enemy.*
The Sidereal rolls (Wits + Larceny) against the Resolve of an enemy within short range. Success lets her impose a −1 penalty on one category of the victim’s rolls: mental, physical, or social. Alternatively, she can lower his soak by one. Every two extra successes increases this penalty by one, maximum −3. The penalty lasts until the end of the scene.
The Sidereal profits from her theft. If she inflicted a dice penalty, she adds that many dice on all rolls of the penalized category. If she penalized her target’s soak, she adds it to her own soak.
Using this Charm has no overt visual display, but the target can feel the Sidereal sapping his prowess. He can end the Charm by crashing or incapacitating the Sidereal.
