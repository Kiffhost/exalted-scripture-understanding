*The Abyssal’s thieving hands are unburdened by any concern for law or propriety, effortlessly claiming trinkets and treasures.*
When the deathknight rolls [[Larceny]] to steal an object that isn’t currently in use or an attuned artifact, she adds ([[Essence]]) successes and succeeds automatically unless opposed by magic. This theft can’t be detected without magic or superhuman senses, and such efforts still suffer a −4 penalty.
Against magic that automatically reveals the use of [[Larceny]] actions, like [[Crime-Unveiling Wickedness]], this Charm forces their user to make a ([[Perception]] + appropriate Ability) roll opposing the Abyssal’s roll for the theft. Observers’ 1s and 2s subtract successes on this roll.
With a [[Larceny]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a three-mote surcharge to render her theft undetectable for ([[Essence]]) minutes, even if it’s done in plain sight. This ends prematurely if a character directly notices the stolen object’s absence, such as a messenger attempting to deliver a missing scroll.
