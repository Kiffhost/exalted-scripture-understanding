# Arms of the Chosen Errata

The Solar coaxes and reshapes an artifact’s Evocations with hammer and flame. She must spend (10 – Essence) hours at work. The player of the artifact’s owner may swap out any of that artifact’s currently active Evocations to unlock new ones, including custom Evocations (p. 18). The artifact’s owner must meet the Essence minimums and prerequisites of any new Evocations he takes, and cannot swap out an Evocation that’s a prerequisite for another currently active Evocation. An artifact may only benefit from a single use of this Charm per story.
# Pre-Errata

Carrying a daiklave or other Artifact weapon into her forge, the Solar may enact a working of hammer and flame, blood and Essence, to coax and reshape the nature of an Exalted weapon, reshaping its current active Evocations. This process takes (10 - Essence) hours, and allows the weapon’s owner’s player to change the weapon’s current active Evocations. If the Solar does not own the weapon she is reforging, the owner can pay the experience point cost of the Charm’s activation. This Charm may only be used on a particular weapon once per story.
