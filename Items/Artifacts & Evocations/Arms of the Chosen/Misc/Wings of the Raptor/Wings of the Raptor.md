While it’s said that Teremi Salo cut the first [[Wings of the Raptor]] from a wind dragon’s hide, these feathered cloaks were usually sewn with moonsilver thread from the skins of hybroc or strix. The cloak’s moonsilver clasp has a socket for a single hearthstone. Attuning the cloak commits one mote. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the [[Wings of the Raptor]]

Unless the Exalt is dissonant with moonsilver, she unlocks [[Raptor Takes Flight]] for no experience cost when she first attunes to the [[Wings of the Raptor]].
