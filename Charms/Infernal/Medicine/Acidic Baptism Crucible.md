*Anointing a favourite in a spray of acrid spittle, the Infernal dissolves his paltry form to leave something greater in its place.*

The Infernal inflicts a mutagenic poison on a willing character, letting him gain up (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3, maximum 5) mutations by incurring experience debt (p. XX). These mutations are demonic in appearance, resembling the denizens of Malfeas. He suffers intervals of poison equal to the number of dots he takes on, as above. The poison has Damage 1L/hour and a −3 penalty. He doesn’t receive a roll to resist, and the poison can’t be treated. However, its damage is never fatal for those the Infernal has positive Ties toward. Once the poison has left his system, he fully heals from that crippling effect.

Alternatively, the Infernal can pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to inflict a flesh-warping poison that heals a crippling effect. This can heal amputations and similarly severe wounds, but only if they happened recently and the patient still has the severed limb to reattach to the wound. The patient must accept intervals of poison based on the wound’s severity, as if it were a crippling injury, equal to the maximum damage that wound could prevent (Exalted, p. 201). She can also grant mutations as well, in which case her patient takes intervals of poison equal to the higher of the two, plus an additional interval.
## [[Keys]]
#### Toxic Mercy Benevolence (Medicine 5, Essence 2)
The poisoned character receives this Charm’s benefits after the first interval of the poison passes, though he still suffers all remaining intervals. The Infernal adds +2 to the number of mutations she can grant.
#### Wound-Dissolving Alchemy (Medicine 5, Essence 3, [[#Toxic Mercy Benevolence (Medicine 5, Essence 2)|Toxic Mercy Benevolence]])
The Infernal can treat the most grievous of crippling effects even if they didn’t occur recently. She can do so even if there isn’t a severed limb to reattach, as her poison causes damaged flesh to regenerate. However, regenerating damaged tissue adds +2 to the intervals of poison the target must take and increases its damage and interval to 4A/week.
