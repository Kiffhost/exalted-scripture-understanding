*Slamming her hands together, the Immaculate creates a deafening thunderclap.*
All other characters in medium range, including allies, must roll (Stamina + Resistance) against it as an environmental hazard with difficulty (Essence + 1), Damage (Strength/2, rounded up)B. The shockwave strikes dematerialized characters as well as materialized ones, and has (Strength)B Damage against spirits. This technique can be heard for miles around, but doesnâ€™t affect characters beyond medium range. 
## Special activation rules
If the Immaculate enters Air Dragon Form with Initiative 20+, she may reflexively use Thunderclap Kata.
