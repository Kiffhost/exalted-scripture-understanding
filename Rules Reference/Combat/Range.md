The [[Accuracy]] of ranged weapons generally varies with range.

There are several range categories that two characters can potentially occupy in relation to one another:
# Close
When a character is at close range, he is in an opponent’s face, close enough to easily attack with a hand-to-hand weapon such as a sword, spear, or his fists. This doesn’t mean that the characters are necessarily within arm’s reach of each other at all times, but rather that they are able to close such a distance in moments. 

If an opponent is within close range of a character, that character is *embattled*, and must use a [[Disengage]] if he wishes to move away from the opponent.
# Short
When a character is at short range, he is outside of the immediate reach of an opponent wielding a hand-to-hand weapon, but close enough that the opponent could reach him with a quick sprint.
# Medium
A character at medium range is a fair distance away from an opponent. This is the range band of the most far-reaching [[Thrown]] weapons, and less powerful [[Archery]] weapons, and at this range it’s impossible for two characters to communicate with one another without shouting. 

Characters cannot make Thrown or Archery attacks from medium range without first taking an [[Aim]], or the attack will automatically miss. This aim action provides no [[Accuracy]] bonus; to gain an accuracy bonus, two aim actions must be taken in a row before the attack.
# Long
A character at long range is very far away from his opponent. Combat at this range can only occur through powerful [[Archery]] weapons such as the [[Long Bow]], and is the favored range of snipers. Closing with a character at long range can be quite difficult! Complex communication is generally impossible without signaling devices, energetic pantomime, or magic. 

Characters cannot make [[Thrown]] or Archery attacks from long range without first taking an [[Aim]], or the attack will automatically miss. This aim action provides no [[Accuracy]] bonus; to gain an accuracy bonus, two aim actions must be taken in a row before the attack.
# Extreme
A final range, extreme range, also exists. At this range, opponents are distant specks; communication is generally impossible, as is combat. All range bands beyond long range are considered extreme range, and a character might potentially be several extreme range bands away from another character in a scene ranging across a very large area. 

In the event that some form of magic or specialized weapon makes an attack from extreme range possible, characters must take an [[Aim]] first, or the attack will automatically miss. This aim action provides no accuracy bonus; to gain an accuracy bonus, two aim actions must be taken in a row before the attack.
