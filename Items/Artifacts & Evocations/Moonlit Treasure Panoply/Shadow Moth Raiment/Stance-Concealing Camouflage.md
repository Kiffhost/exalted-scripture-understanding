The wearer’s technique is a lie, concealing one style behind the semblance of another.
To use this Evocation, the wearer must be in a Form Charm. She reflexively activates a different Form, changing between them as she reveals that her enemies have misread her fighting style.
## Resonant
With an [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the wearer can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use this Evocation even when she isn’t in a Form, her style concealed behind seemingly ordinary movements.

## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by using a different Form Charm.
Awakening: This Evocation awakens for free if the wearer meets its prerequisites.
