The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] can soar through the air on enormous wings or levitate on waves of eldritch force, intangible threads strung from the sky or stranger means. She’s capable of flight with her movement actions. When she enters her[[Devil-Body]], she can reflexively ascend one range band and move up to one range band horizontally.
