With flawless gaze and unswerving eye, the Exalt’s vision corrects itself, eating away impurities and anomalies to give her the most perfect view. When contesting a [[Stealth]] or [[Larceny]] action against the character, this Charm can be used to create a cascading reroll, eliminating non-successes from the [[Awareness]] roll as the Solar’s vision corrects itself. After an [[Awareness]] roll, record successes and reroll ([[Essence]]) non-successes. For each of these dice that turns up a success, reroll another die until the cascade fails to produce any successes. Dice rerolled by [[Sensory Acuity Prana]] are not included in the cascade. This Charm may also be used in [[Join Battle]] against an opponent the Lawgiver can see.
