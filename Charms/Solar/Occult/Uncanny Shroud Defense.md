On the verge of death, the Exalt draws uncanny Essence around her like a shroud, stepping between worlds. When struckwithanykindofdamageorattackthatwouldremove her last health level, the Exalt may use this Charm to stop the final level of damage. This Charm cannot be used if the Solar is currently on her last uninjured health level.
