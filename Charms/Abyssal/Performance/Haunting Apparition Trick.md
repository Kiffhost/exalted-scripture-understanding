*The Abyssal accentuates her performance with eerie apparitions — phantasmal imagery, blood that seems to drip down walls, inexplicable chills, shadows moving strangely, and the like.*
The Abyssal can pay a one-mote surcharge when she uses [[Morbid Fascination Style]] or [[Undying Virtuoso Spirit]] to enhance illusory apparitions. They can extend out to short range from her, and individual apparitions can be up to the size of a person. With [[Performance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, they can be up to Legendary [[Size]].
These apparitions are obviously illusory, and won’t block lines of sight or otherwise impede senses, but they expand the type and amount of information the Abyssal’s influence can convey. This can be used to circumvent language barriers, time pressure, or other impediments to communicating complex ideas.
With a [[Performance]] 5 repurchase, the Abyssal can instead pay a three-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to create convincing illusions. She uses the result of her influence roll to determine her illusions’ quality, or rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Performance]]) if she didn’t use influence. Onlookers can only roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) to see through this if they have specific reason to question the apparition’s reality or if they have magically enhanced or superhuman senses that are relevant to recognizing it. Even then, they suffer a −4 penalty and their 1s subtract successes.
