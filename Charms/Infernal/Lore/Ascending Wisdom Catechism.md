*The Infernal is an insurmountable peak of wisdom, the summit to which lesser minds aspire.*

The Infernal trains a student. Before he can receive her wisdom, he must choose one of his Principles to cultivate, strengthening it by one step. If he has any Intimacies that oppose the Principle, he can’t benefit from this training until he’s fully removed them.

A suitable aspirant can be trained in (his base Resolve, maximum 5) dots of relevant Attributes or Abilities, which must relate to the chosen Principle or a goal related to that Principle. He adds +1 to this if the chosen Principle is negative. This can raise his trait ratings above the Infernal’s own. For Quick Characters, this can raise dice pools up to fourteen dice and static values up to seven. The training time required is divided by (target’s Resolve + 5), and the Infernal only needs to spend a single scene mentoring him.
## [[Keys]]
#### Summit-Aspirant Convocation (Lore 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal can train up to (Essence) students with a single use of this Charm. Not all students need take the same traits, although the Storyteller may require her to stunt appropriate instruction for training widely disparate subjects. Alternatively, she can train up to (Essence x5) students, but halves the number of dots she can grant each of them, rounded up.
