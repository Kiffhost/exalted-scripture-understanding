*The Infernal has contingencies and countermeasures for even the most unimaginable disasters.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after making a Bureaucracy roll related to leadership, organizational management, taking measures against sabotage, and the like. She rerolls all dice that initially rolled failures and can activate additional Charms to enhance the roll, retroactively revealing contingency measures she’s prepared.

If the Infernal’s roll is opposed by a character attempting to sabotage her leadership, curse her organization, or the like, it also counts as a special read intentions roll against him. If successful, the Infernal begins to catch glimpses of the saboteur when she looks in reflective surfaces. They’re not clear enough to reveal his identity, but the Infernal will automatically recognize him if they meet in person.

Once the Infernal learns the saboteur’s identity — either by meeting him or otherwise — she immediately forms a Minor Tie to him. Its emotional context depends on how she views him as a rival: a Tie of love for a worthy opponent, or a Tie of disgust for those who fall short.
