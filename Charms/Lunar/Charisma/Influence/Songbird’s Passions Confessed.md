Stirring the passions of others, the Lunar lays their hearts bare.
When the Lunar successfully reads the intentions of someone affected by [[Rapture of the Nightingale]], her player can ask the Storyteller one of the below questions about the inspired emotion. Every three extra successes let her ask an additional question.
 - What’s an [[Intimacy]] he has that involves that emotion?  - What’s an [[Intimacy]] he has that opposes that emotion?  - Is there something involving that emotion that he’s not being honest about with me?  - Is there something involving that emotion that he’s not being honest about with himself? Questions about Intimacies can be asked multiple times.
If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Lunar’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
If the Lunar has [[Creation-Spanning Passion]] (Lunars, p.
167), when she’s sharing dreams, her player can ask one of the above questions about any emotion, in addition to the usual question.
