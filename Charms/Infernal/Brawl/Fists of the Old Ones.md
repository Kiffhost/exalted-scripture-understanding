*Those hurled away by the Infernal’s unholy might are fortunate — perhaps they’ll land out of sight as she slaughters their comrades.*

If the Infernal deals damage with a decisive attack, she knocks her opponent prone. He gains a Minor Tie of fear to her. Depending on how many levels of damage she deals, she strikes with greater force:
- **3+ Damage**: If there’s a nearby obstacle, the Infernal can slam him against it, causing him to suffer damage equivalent to a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232). It must be close enough that he can smash into it without needing to move between range bands. If the collision deals damage, the Willpower cost to resist gaining an Intimacy is increased by one.
- **4+ Damage**: As above, but the collision damage is equivalent to a medium-range fall. Alternatively, the Infernal can knock her enemy back or upward by one range band, inflicting short-range fall damage if he collides with an obstacle. Dealing damages increases the Willpower cost to resist gaining an Intimacy by two.
- **5+ Damage**: As above, but the collision damage is still equivalent to a medium-range fall if the Infernal knocks her target back. Dealing damages increases the Willpower cost to resist gaining an Intimacy by three.

If the Infernal’s victim collides with an obstacle, the falling damage roll is also treated as a feat of demolition against it. If the feat is successful, he loses (Infernal’s Strength) Initiative. If the attack incapacitated him, she adds this to her base Initiative instead.

With Essence 3, the Infernal doubles the total damage dealt for purposes of this Charm’s effect. If she deals 7+ damage, she can knock an enemy back or upward by two range bands, with medium-range fall damage. If the collision deals damage, the Willpower cost to resist gaining an Intimacy is increased by four.
## [[Keys]]
#### Infernal Hellraiser’s Instinct (Brawl 5, Essence 3) (4m, 1wp)
Once per scene, when the Infernal knocks an enemy upward, she can pay four motes, one Willpower to leap into the air with him, making a reflexive decisive attack against him before he plummets and suffers falling damage. Her Initiative doesn’t reset until she’s made this attack. The Infernal doesn’t suffer falling damage. This uses her movement action. She can reset this key by gaining ten Initiative in a single tick.
