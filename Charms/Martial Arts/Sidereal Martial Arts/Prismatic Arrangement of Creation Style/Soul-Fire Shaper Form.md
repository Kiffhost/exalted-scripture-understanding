The Sidereal acts in perfect balance with the cosmos, bringing the world around her into alignment with her victory. 
-  She adds +2 effective Essence, maximum 10, for magic that uses Essence ratings in calculations (but not for any other purpose). 
-  Once per round, she may reduce the Willpower cost of Astrology Interruption Method, Essence Redirection Technique, Sequential Essence Disruption, or Spell-Shattering Palm by one. 
-  When she would gain Initiative, she may exchange some or all of it for that many motes instead. She canâ€™t do so when resetting Initiative. 
-  When paying Willpower, she may spend five motes in place of a point of Willpower. Enlightenment: The stylist counts as having Essence 10 for calculations.
