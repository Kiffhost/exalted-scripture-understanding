Not even well-tempered steel can survive the full force of Sekhem’s fire. This Evocation burns or melts almost any non-magical substance, affecting an area within close range that’s roughly ten feet in diameter and three feet thick. This can carve a hole in a wall or floor, vaporize the bars of a cage, or turn bedrock into a seething pool of lava. Characters standing in or caught beneath a wash of molten stone face a one-time environmental hazard with Difficulty 5, Damage 6L. Outside of combat, this Evocation’s Heat minimum is waived. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a successful decisive attack while at Initiative 12+.
