For just a moment, the stars align to bring Kaijin’s wearer briefly out of phase with the material world. This Evocation enhances a roll to oppose a grapple, disengage or withdraw from an enemy, or otherwise escape from an enemy. The target number of the roll — the number a die must show to be counted as a success — is lowered by one. No combination of effects can lower a roll’s target number below 4. 

## Dissonant

The wearer may only count up to (Essence) 6s as successes. 

## Resonant

In addition to lowering her target number by one, this Evocation raises the target number of all opposed rolls by one. No combination of effects can raise a roll’s target number above 9.
