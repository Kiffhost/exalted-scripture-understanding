The Sidereal makes the Greater Sign of the Captain before a heavenly gate to impose her authority upon it, rimming its edge with saffron fire as a distant destination appears on its other side. When the Sidereal and any characters accompanying her cross through one of Heaven’s gates (p. XX), she can use this Charm to appear at one of the following destinations instead of that gate’s normal exit: 
-  A manse to which she’s attuned. 
-  A building she legally owns or holds legitimate authority over. 
-  A ship or similar vehicle she’s piloted this story or that she owns or holds legitimate authority over. 
-  The Bureau of Destiny, if she’s in its employ.
