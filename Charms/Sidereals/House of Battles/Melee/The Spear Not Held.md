*Envisioning the outcome of an exchange of blows with her foe countless times in a single instant, the Sidereal weaves her triumph into fate without ever needing to draw her weapon.*
The Sidereal makes a (Perception + Melee) withering attack against the Guile of an enemy within medium range. Instead of using a weapon’s traits, this attack has Accuracy and Overwhelming (Essence, maximum 5). It has Damage (10 + Perception) but doesn’t include Strength. The attack ignores armored soak, and its target substitutes his base Guile for his base natural soak against it.
Using this Charm to make an unexpected attack doesn’t break concealment.
## Special activation rules
This Charm can be flurried with an aim, full defense, or threaten action.
