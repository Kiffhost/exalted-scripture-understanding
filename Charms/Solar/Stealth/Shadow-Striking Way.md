The Lawgiver strikes from the shadows and is gone again. This Charm supplements a decisive attack made from concealment, and uses extra successes from the attack as automatic non-Charm successes on a [[Stealth]] roll for the Solar to re-enter concealment, ignoring the penalty for attempting concealment during combat. If the roll for concealment is successful, the Lawgiver moves to a new hiding place within one range band. As her old location is discovered, the Lawgiver must move in order to use this Charm. If the Storyteller deems there are no other places of cover or concealment within one range band, this Charm can’t be used. Extra decisive attack successes used by [[Shadow-Striking Way]] cannot be used by hypothetical other [[Charms]] that might use them. If the Solar combines this Charm with [[Shadow-Crossing Leap Technique]] (Exalted p. 408) lower the cost of that Charm to one mote, one [[Willpower]], and double the automatic successes granted to the Lawgiver’s [[Stealth]] attempt.

### On [[Shadow-Striking Way]]

The backer wanted a way to attack from concealment and immediately disappear like a deadly shadow. I could tell from his description that he wanted something a little more versatile than [[Hidden Snake Recoil]]. The problem with this effect has always been balancing it. Fighting from a state of concealment is prohibitive on purpose. Thus, I balanced this Charm against the significant advantage it confers. [[Charms]] that follow [[Shadow-Striking Way]] will only enhance it in very gradual ways. Like many Solar [[Charms]], [[Shadow-Striking Way]] is a central effect from which small upgrade [[Charms]] might radiate outward. Backer: Kalzera of Nugasya
