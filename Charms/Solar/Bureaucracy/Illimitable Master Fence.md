*By spending a day in a market, the Lawgiver can sense the ebb and flow of commerce, guiding her to knowledge of hidden or illegal markets.*
By observing normal transactions, speaking with merchants and customers, and watching the general course of economic dalliance, she becomes aware of the bureaucratic specialties of everyone connected to a specific market. The Lawgiver even becomes aware of the special market knowledge of characters whose names she doesnâ€™t know and whose faces she has never seen.
