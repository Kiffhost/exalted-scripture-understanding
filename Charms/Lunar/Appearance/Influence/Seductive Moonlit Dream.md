The Lunar embodies passion, drawing eyes and weakening wills. She doubles 9s on an instill roll to create a Tie of lust or attraction toward herself (or her current form), or a persuade or bargain roll for seduction. Protean: Characters with Ties of lust, love, desire, etc. toward the Lunarâ€™s current human shape treat their Resolve as 1 lower when determining how many bonus dice her Appearance adds (Exalted, p. 218).
