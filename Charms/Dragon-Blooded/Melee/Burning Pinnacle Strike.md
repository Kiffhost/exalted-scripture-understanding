*The Exalt’s body, skill, and [[Essence]] unite in the moment of her triumph, striking a rapid blow guided by sheer instinct and the flame of her fighting spirit.*
After making a withering attack that leaves her with an [[Initiative]] higher than that of all enemies present in the combat, she reflexively makes a withering or decisive attack. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. This Charm may only be used once per round.
