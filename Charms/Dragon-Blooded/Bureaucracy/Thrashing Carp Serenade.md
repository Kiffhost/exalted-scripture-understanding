The Dragon-Blood impedes the flow of an enemy organization with frightening efficacy, whether by sabotaging a rival’s commercial contracts, sowing discord among ministers of a foreign government, or bringing about a bureaucracy’s ruin from within. After at least one scene spent sabotaging a project or bureaucratic task, she rolls ([Manipulation or Intelligence] + Bureaucracy) with double 9s. The difficulty is (the project leader’s higher of Essence or Bureaucracy). A successful roll doubles the time needed to complete the project. Every threshold success increases this multiplier by one, up to a maximum of (the Dragon-Blood’s Essence). This can be negated by magic such as Bureau-Reforming Kata (Exalted, p. 286). The Dragon-Blood cannot use Thrashing Carp Serenade against the same organization more than once per story, even if its projects are led by different characters.
