The Exalt can completely banish a targetâ€™s pain with but a touch. When she uses this Charm, her subject is suffused with [[Essence]] that flows through his nerve endings, transforming pain signals into those of euphoria. This prevents a character from feeling pain, removing all wound penalties. However, it also puts stress on the Solar. Should her target engage in strenuous activity such as combat, the Solar takes a -1 penalty to all actions as long as she keeps the Charm committed. This penalty stacks; if the Exalt supports multiple characters in this way, then her penalty mounts.
