*The Lunar marks those closest to her heart with her sacred brand.*
The Lunar gains the following benefits when using [[Shining Moon-Child Mark]]: Argent Dreamer Glyph: If she has [[Creation-Spanning Passion]] (Lunars, p. 167), she may imbue a mark with a spiritual link when she bestows it on someone she has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] for, causing them to share dreams as per that Charm.
Boundless Argent Patronage: She reduces the total mote cost of all uses of it by (higher of [[Essence]] or 3). For example, an [[Essence]] 1 Lunar would pay zero motes for the first use, one mote for the second use, and full cost for further uses.
Mark of Distant Embrace: If she has [[Divine Paramour’s Embrace]] (Lunars, p. 148), she can use it on a marked character whenever he sleeps without requiring a roll, as if she were there to comfort him herself. With that Charm’s repurchase, she can do so at any time.
Sigil of the [[Eclipse]]: She can use [[Shining Moon-Child Mark]] based on her Solar mate’s [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward someone rather than one of her own. Her mate must either be present or have previously expressed his [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the Lunar.
