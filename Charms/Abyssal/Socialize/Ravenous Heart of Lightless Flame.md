*The Abyssal reveals her inner nature, consuming the minds of those who can’t accept this revelation.*
The deathknight causes a read intentions action against her to fail automatically unless the opposing character accepts (higher of Abyssal’s Essence or Anima) dice of aggravated decisive damage to look upon the unbearable truth she embodies. This damage can’t be prevented by any means.
If the Abyssal successfully asserts her Guile against a character who chose to accept the damage, that character believes he succeeded…only to discover a truth terrible beyond words. He gains a Major Principle related to death, the dead, or the Underworld to represent this revelation’s impact, chosen by the deathknight’s player. Her victim can’t spend Willpower to resist this.
For the rest of the scene, any of the Abyssal’s influence that leverages the inflicted Intimacy costs an additional Willpower to resist.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses this Charm together with Fathomless Inner Night, she can choose to threaten her target if he fails rather than instilling an Intimacy.
