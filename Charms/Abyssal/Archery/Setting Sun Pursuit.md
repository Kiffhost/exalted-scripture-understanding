*A long hunt only heightens the Abyssal’s hunger for bloodshed.*
The Abyssal may use this Charm after a successful tracking roll, rush, or [[Awareness]] roll opposing a character’s [[Stealth]]. She banks a special pool of [[Initiative]] equal to her total successes on that roll, maximum ([[Perception]] or [[Wits]]). When she Joins Battle against that enemy, she may add the pooled [[Initiative]] to the [[Initiative]] she receives from Joining Battle.
Alternatively, when the Abyssal makes a decisive attack against that enemy, she may add the pooled [[Initiative]] to its damage roll. She can use this to attack him while crashed, using only the [[Initiative]] from the pool for the attack’s damage.
