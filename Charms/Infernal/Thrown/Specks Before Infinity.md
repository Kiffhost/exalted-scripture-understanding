*Space ceases to matter amid the Endless Desert’s sands. So too does the Infernal strike without thought for the space between.*

When the Infernal makes an attack, she may treat it as if she were attacking from a point at close range. This effects things like a withering attack’s Accuracy bonus, whether she needs to aim, the applicability of cover, and her weapon’s range — potentially letting her attack at extreme range.

If the Infernal displaces an attack while concealed, it doesn’t break her concealment if she rolls 3+ extra successes on the attack roll.
## [[Keys]]
#### False Oasis Harrowing
Instead of this Charm’s usual effect, the Infernal can twist space at up to (higher of Essence or 3) points within short range. She can make attacks as if she were at any of those points, as above, regardless of where she is. With Essence 5, this key’s range increases to medium.
#### Twisting Sandstorm Withdrawal (Essence 5, [[#False Oasis Harrowing]]) (5m, 1wp)
While using [[#False Oasis Harrowing]], the Infernal can reflexively pay five motes and one Willpower on her turn to vanish and reappear at one of the chosen points within long range, without crossing the space between. The Willpower cost is waived if the point is within short range. She reappears in a cloud of silver sand, letting her reflexively roll Stealth to establish concealment. This uses her movement action.
