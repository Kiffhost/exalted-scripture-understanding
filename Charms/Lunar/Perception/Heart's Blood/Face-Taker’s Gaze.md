The Lunar drinks deep of her prey’s soul with her eyes, seeing herself reflected in the mirror of his heart. She performs a sacred hunt to claim a human’s shape by observing him, spending the majority of her active time watching, until she discovers one of his Defining Intimacies — either with a successful read intentions roll, or by observing his actions. Once the Lunar uncovers a Defining Intimacy, she may conclude the sacred hunt by forming that Intimacy herself and raising it to Defining. This counts as the Intimacy needed to take a human shape. Once the Lunar takes a shape this way, she can’t voluntarily weaken the acquired Intimacy for the rest of the story. If the Lunar’s mistaken as to her prey’s Intimacies, the sacred hunt fails; she can’t take his shape through this Charm again this story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means. This usually occurs if the Lunar makes an incorrect assumption about her target’s Intimacies and doesn’t verify it by reading his intentions, but can also result from deceptive magic. Senses
