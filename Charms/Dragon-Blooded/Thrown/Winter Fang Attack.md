The Terrestrial’s weapon is chilled by her deadly intent, numbing flesh as it strikes. This Charm can supplement a decisive attack or a gambit. If the attack deals damage or the gambit succeeds, the enemy loses Initiative equal to the10sonthedamagerollortheInitiativeroll,maximum (Essence). The Dragon-Blood doesn’t gain this Initiative.
