*The Wyld often lures ships into unstable waters where the crew becomes monstrous and the ship transforms into something that can no longer float.*
A Lawgiver who knows this Charm will automatically sense the Wyld approaching her ship at least one round before passing into it. She may activate this Charm, thinning her anima into a crackling, stabilizing field that crawls over the deck, mast, and surrounding atmosphere, making it immune to the Wyld’s shaping influence before fading out of view. This protection extends to the ship’s crew as long as they remain aboard the ship. The Solar may activate this Charm even while she is asleep.
