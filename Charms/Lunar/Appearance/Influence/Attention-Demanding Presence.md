*Magnifying her presence, the Lunar stands at the center of attention.*
Any characters that can see her suffer a −(Lunar’s [[Appearance]] − his [[Resolve]]) penalty, minimum −1, on [[Perception]] rolls, except those opposing her [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]]. A character that botches a penalized roll forms a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of desire or fear, as appropriate, toward the Lunar (or her current shape). However, the Lunar takes a −3 penalty on [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] rolls.
