The Immaculate Order doesnâ€™t object to interest-bearing loans in and of themselves, but predatory loans are another matter. The Order opposes lending that crosses class boundaries. Poor peasants, unable to understand the intricacies of patrician and Dynastic financial instruments, cannot help but be taken advantage of. Like the Inconsiderate Horseman, the creditor acts without care for the harm she causes the debtor. 

Immaculate disapproval goes both ways, however. A debtor knowingly accepting a loan beyond her current means to repay indicates that, like the Ostentatious Peasant, she expects her fortunes to change for the better. Yet all members of the Perfected Hierarchy should accept the lot offered them by the Dragons. In such circumstances, the victim receives as much blame as the perpetrator.
