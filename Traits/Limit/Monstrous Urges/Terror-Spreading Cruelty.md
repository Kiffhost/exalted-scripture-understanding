The Lunar’s cruelty runs rampant, an unbound embodiment of horrific monstrosity. She pursues goals in the manner most likely to terrorize as many people as possible. Should she fight off a bandit gang to protect a village, she will inflict as much pain and fear on them as she can and leave their mutilated corpses as a warning to future raiders. If she courts a prince’s favor by training his soldiers, she’ll browbeat them while training them in demoralizing strategies, possibly spreading rumors of their horrific devil-might throughout the prince’s kingdom and neighboring lands.
This ends if the Lunar is confronted by a significant enemy who seeks to defeat her because of the terror she’s spread.
