# Minor
The victim feels weary and lethargic, suffering a −1 fatigue penalty on all rolls unless he receives twelve hours of sleep each day. Rolls to diagnose the disease are made at +4 difficulty. 
# Major
The victim’s fatigue penalty stacks by one each day he goes without twelve hours of sleep, maximum −5. In addition, he can no longer heal damage naturally (Exalted, p. 173) if he remains fully active during convalescence. Rolls to diagnose the disease are made at +3 difficulty.
