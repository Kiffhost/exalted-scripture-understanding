Emerald Grasshopper Form Taking on the shape of a vast swarm, the Lunar unleashes the multitude of herself. When she uses Emerald Grasshopper Form to become a Minuscule Size animal, she may become a swarm. She must pay four motes on each subsequent turn to maintain this. Her swarm-shape loses Minuscule Size’s effects (p. XX), gaining the following instead: 
-  She gains (lowest of Dexterity, Stamina, or Wits) temporary −0 health levels. These temporary levels are the first to be filled when she takes damage, and vanish when filled. 
-  She gains a swarming attack with light weapon traits (Accuracy +4, Damage +7, Defense +0, Overwhelming 1) and the Lethal, Brawl, Flexible, Grappling, Natural, and Piercing tags. Swarming attacks apply to all enemies within close range, using one attack roll. On withering attacks, only the highest damage roll awards Initiative. On decisive attacks, she divides her Initiative evenly among all hit enemies (rounding up) to determine the damage rolled against them. On gambits, she likewise divides her Initiative evenly among hit enemies (rounding up) for Initiative rolls, though she need only pay the gambit’s Initiative cost once. Grappling has additional rules, detailed below. Swarming attacks are incompatible with Simple Charms. 
-  On a successful grapple, she makes one (Strength + Brawl) control roll opposing each enemy she succeeded against on the Initiative roll. On each turn of the clinch, she may either restrain all foes, expending two rounds of control over each of them; make one withering or decisive savaging attack against all clinched foes, as described above; or release all foes. 
-  She can’t use Parry to defend. She gains +3 Evasion, halves the minimum damage of withering attacks against her, rounded down, and subtracts one level of damage from decisive attacks against her. These benefits don’t apply against weapons with the Flame or Siege tags, attacks enhanced by magic capable of striking multiple enemies or an area of effect, or other effects the Storyteller deems capable of harming the entire swarm. She’s immune to grapples, unless enhanced with magic that could feasibly constrain her swarm-self. 
-  Human-sized or smaller characters suffer a −3 penalty on rolls opposing her rushes or disengages, and rolls to disengage from her. They must disengage to move away from her while at short range or closer to her.
