*Moving in grotesque contortions, the stylist weaves beyond her foe’s reach.*
The stylist can use this Charm after being hit by an attack, but before the damage roll. She rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) opposing the [[attack]] roll. This also counts as a [[threaten]] roll. If the stylist has [[Hideous]], her [[Appearance]] adds bonus dice on the roll.
If the stylist beats the attack roll, she reflexively moves one range band away from her attacker after the attack. This doesn’t use her [[movement]] action. If she beats the attacker’s [[Resolve]], he can’t move toward her until his next turn ends unless he resists her [[influence]]. As long as the stylist beats either, up to ([[Essence]]) 1s on the damage roll subtract successes. If she beats both, 2s also subtract successes.
## Mastery
The stylist can use this Charm after the damage roll.
## Terrestrial
This counts as the stylist’s movement action for the round — or the next round, if she’s already taken one.
