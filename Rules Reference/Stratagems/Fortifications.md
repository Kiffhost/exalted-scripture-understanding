The victorious general leaves her enemy with no choice but to confront her on a battlefield sheâ€™s prepared in advance to confound her foes. This may be an entrenched camp on a hill surrounded by palisades of stakes, or it may mean street-to-street fighting in a city where the victorious force has prepared avenues of swift movement with which the enemy is unfamiliar; it may even indicate warfare across a series of collapsible trenches. In any event, the opposing force begins the fight at [[Range#Long]], and treats the entire battlefield as [[difficult terrain]], whereas the victorious force treats the battlefield as normal terrain.
