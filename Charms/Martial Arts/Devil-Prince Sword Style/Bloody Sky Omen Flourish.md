*The Devil-Prince celebrates her kill with a spray of blood and a cry of victory, letting surviving enemies know it’s merely a matter of time before they fall to her artistry.*

The stylist can use this Charm after dealing decisive damage, reflexively rolling ({Appearance or Charisma} + {Performance or Presence}) against her victim and all other enemies who witnessed her attack to instill a [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven Intimacy]]. (Note that this can strengthen existing [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven intimacies]].) Affected characters lose (1 + 10s on the damage roll, maximum 5) Initiative unless they resist this with Willpower.

If the stylist uses this Charm after an attack that incapacitates an enemy or inflicts a crippling injury, characters who already have [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven intimacies]] suffer one die of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness, in addition to losing Initiative as their fear and misery churns in their body.
### Terrestrial
The Initiative loss can’t exceed (Essence).
