*Patient as death and cunning as night, the Abyssal schemer is never caught without a plan.*
The Abyssal can use [[Villainous Mastermind’s Foresight]] reflexively without need for a planning scene, revealing a scheme already in motion. She adds a free full Excellency on the roll and mutes all motes spent on it.
## Reset 
Once per story unless the Abyssal’s plan faces a significant setback or obstacle from an unexpected obstacle.
