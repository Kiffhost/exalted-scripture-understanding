*The weave of fate itself strains as the Sidereal performs feats of impossible might, wrestling behemoths and kicking down towers.*
The Sidereal can grapple a Legendary [[Size]] foe or forcibly move it with an attack or similar effect. She waives the [[Willpower]] cost to reduce the target number of rolls to do so with any Ability. Alternatively, the Sidereal can undertake a feat of strength that would normally be impossible given her size and leverage, lifting an object as though her gripâ€™s leverage extended one range band further than usual or destroying a portion of a large object one range band beyond what she could normally do. With [[Essence]] 5, every five extra successes on a feat of strength extend its scale by one range band, maximum +4. 
## Reset
Once per day unless reset by fulfilling an auspicious prospect with a feat of strength or joining battle against a Legendary [[Size]] enemy.
