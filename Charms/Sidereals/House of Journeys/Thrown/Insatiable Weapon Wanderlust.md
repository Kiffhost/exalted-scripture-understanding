Whispering to her weapon of distant lands to her weapon, the Sidereal fills its heart with unquenchable wanderlust. The Sidereal’s attack extends its range by one band, maximum long. If the attack roll’s target number is reduced, she extends the attack’s range by two bands instead. With [[Thrown]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Sidereal may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to extend this Charm’s maximum range to extreme.
