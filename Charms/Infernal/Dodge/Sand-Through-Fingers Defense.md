*The Infernal eludes her foe’s grasp, dissolving into silvery sands, crimson wind, shattered glass, or writhing shadows.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after successfully dodging an attack, dissolving and then reforming one range band away. This doesn’t let her pass through physical barriers.
## [[Keys]]
#### Bloodless Murk Evasion (Dodge 4, Essence 2) (+2m)
For a two-mote surcharge, if the Infernal successfully dodges, she can reflexively roll Stealth to establish concealment, as long as her new location provides a suitable hiding spot.
#### Drifting Demon Abduction (Dodge 5, Essence 2) (+3m)
When the Infernal dodges an attack at close range, she can pay a three-mote surcharge to drag her enemy with her to her new location. If this directly imperils him, such as dragging him off a cliff, the Storyteller should let him make a suitable roll to avoid harm, like rolling (Dexterity + Athletics) to grab on to the cliffside.
#### Sand-Slip Trick ([[#Drifting Demon Abduction (Dodge 5, Essence 2) (+3m)|Drifting Demon Abduction]])
When the Infernal uses [[#Drifting Demon Abduction (Dodge 5, Essence 2) (+3m)|Drifting Demon Abduction]], she can choose to displace her attacker while remaining in her current position.
#### Laughing Gust Denial (Dodge 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal’s ephemeral form allows her to pass through any obstructions between her and her destination.
