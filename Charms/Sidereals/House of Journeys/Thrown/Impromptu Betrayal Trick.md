*Once the Sidereal’s sent her enemy’s weapon flying from his grasp, there’s no telling where it could end up.*
When the Sidereal successfully disarms a character, she can use this Charm to reflexively make a decisive attack using the disarmed weapon against a character within medium range of its former wielder. She suffers no penalties for attacking with an artifact weapon attuned by another character. This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if the Sidereal attacks an enemy suffering from LifeGets-Worse Approach.
