*Those who shed sacred blood invite their own destruction.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after taking decisive damage from an attack at close range. She unleashes a spray of envenomed blood, rolling an unblockable decisive counterattack with (Stamina + Medicine). Her wound penalty doesn’t apply to this roll — instead, she adds that many non-Charm dice. An enemy hit by the attack doesn’t take damage, but is exposed to the poison created by Spiteful Sea Tincture. This benefits from any of that Charm’s keys that the Infernal has unlocked.

With Medicine 5, Essence 3, the Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to unleash this counterattack against all enemies within close range. She can do so even if the decisive damage she took came from a ranged attack, an environmental hazard, or the like.
