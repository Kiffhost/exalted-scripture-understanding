The necromancer may recognize characters by the smell or taste of their blood, granting her one success on appropriate rolls such as identifying wounded targets with a [[case scene]] action or [[tracking]] them. If she encounters a character whose blood she has tasted, she gains the same bonus to recognize them through disguises.
