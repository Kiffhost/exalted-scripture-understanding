*The flames of the Lunar’s rage aren’t easily snuffed.*
Once per day, she may reset [[Halting the Scarlet Flow]] by activating [[Relentless Lunar Fury]]. Additionally, when she activates [[Halting the Scarlet Flow]] in the same instant as [[Relentless Lunar Fury]], [[Halting the Scarlet Flow]] loses the Perilous keyword, letting her use it while crashed.
