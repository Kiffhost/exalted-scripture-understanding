*The Infernal scours away any sound that she might make, becoming a creature of utter silence.*

The Infernal adds (Essence) non-Charm dice on a Stealth roll and acts with perfect silence. Opposed rolls that are based solely on hearing fail automatically. Characters with magically enhanced or superhuman hearing can hear her, but suffer a −2 penalty on the roll.

Alternatively, the Infernal can silence a physical action with any Ability, making it impossible to detect with hearing. (She doesn’t add dice on the roll). The silence doesn’t apply to indirect consequences of the action, like the sound of glass broken by her arrows.

However, embracing silence is not without cost. The Infernal is left unable to speak or make any vocal utterances for the rest of the scene, except for laughter.
## [[Keys]]
#### Silence Precedes Slaughter (Stealth 4, Essence 2)
This Charm’s duration is extended until the start of the Infernal’s next turn.
#### Thousand Voices Silenced (Stealth 4, Essence 2, [[#Silence Precedes Slaughter (Stealth 4, Essence 2)|Silence Precedes Slaughter]]) (+4m)
The Infernal can pay a four-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s silence to affect everyone and everything within close range. (This doesn’t render others voiceless). If she’s in concealment with 5+ Stealth successes, this increases to short range.
#### Crimson Whisper Refinement (Stealth 5, Essence 3, [[#Silence Precedes Slaughter (Stealth 4, Essence 2)|Silence Precedes Slaughter]]) (+2m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene. Doing so leaves her voiceless for the rest of the day.
#### Voiceless Annihilation Whirlwind (Essence 5, [[#Crimson Whisper Refinement (Stealth 5, Essence 3, Silence Precedes Slaughter (Stealth 4, Essence 2) Silence Precedes Slaughter ) (+2m, 1wp)|Crimson Whisper Refinement]])
When the Infernal uses [[#Crimson Whisper Refinement (Stealth 5, Essence 3, Silence Precedes Slaughter (Stealth 4, Essence 2) Silence Precedes Slaughter ) (+2m, 1wp)|Crimson Whisper Refinement]], it extends this Charm’s duration to indefinite. Learning this key renders the Infernal permanently voiceless.
