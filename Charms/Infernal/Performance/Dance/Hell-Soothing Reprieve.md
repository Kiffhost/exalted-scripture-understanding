*The horrors of reality cannot touch the Infernal as she dances through their tumult. Flame and storm alike bow to her who forgives their wrath.*

The Infernal calms an environmental hazard with her dance, rolling ({Appearance, Charisma, or Stamina} + Performance) against its difficulty. She doubles 9s against mundane hazards as well as supernatural hazards of the Demon Realm. If she succeeds, the hazard is suppressed for as long as she continues to dance. Any terrain rendered perilous or impassable by the hazard can be safely traversed, like walking over the surface of molten lava. The Infernal can’t take non-reflexive actions while performing.

For very large hazards, like a hurricane or raging wildfire, this quiescence is limited, extending out to long range from the Infernal, plus an additional range band for every two extra successes. On the other hand, smaller hazards, like a single bonfire, may be snuffed out permanently even after the Infernal stops dancing.

Once this Charm ends, the hazard remains quiescent until the end of the Infernal’s next turn. If she uses it again before the hazard resumes, she waives its Willpower cost and doesn’t need to roll to keep the hazard suppressed.

This Charm ends if the Infernal attacks or takes other hostile action, with the hazard resuming immediately. She can’t use it again for the rest of the day.
## [[Keys]]
#### Revel Before the End (Essence 5) (+5m)
Once per story, the Infernal can stay the wrath of the heavens themselves. She can hold back a natural disaster or great cataclysm, even if it deals uncountable damage: an earthquake that threatens to swallow a city, a volatile manse on the verge of exploding, a sorcerer’s [[Rain of Doom]], a disaster foretold with [[God-King’s Shrike (Dogstar Ruminations)|God-King's Shrike]], etc. The roll’s base difficulty is 5; for perils created by another character, add (his Essence/2, rounded up) to the difficulty. If successful, the cataclysm and its effects are halted out to a distance of one mile from her for as long as she dances, plus an additional mile for every two extra successes. An earthquake pauses; a falling star halts its descent; a tidal wave dances alongside her rather than breaking against the shore. Once she stops dancing, the cataclysm arrives in full force after a minute has passed. She can reset this key by accomplishing a legendary social goal.
