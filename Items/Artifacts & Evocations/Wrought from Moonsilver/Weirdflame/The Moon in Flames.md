*The Lunar may use Weirdflame’s fire to transform characters with [[Sharing Luna’s Gifts]] (p.*
XX), waiving its health-level cost. If she knows [[Insidious Lunar Transformation]] (p. XX), she can make its gambit with [[Weirdflame]], waiving its health-level cost. [[Evocations]] that enhance [[Wyld-Flame Crucible]] also enhance [[Insidious Lunar Transformation]] — for example, reducing the difficulty of using it against a target marked by [[Twisting Ash Brand]]. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the Lunar fails a roll against Spark of Madness’ [[Derangement]].
