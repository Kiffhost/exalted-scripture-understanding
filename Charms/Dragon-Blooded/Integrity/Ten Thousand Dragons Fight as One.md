*The bellicose temperament of the Dragon-Blooded has set them against each other throughout the ages, but in times of crisis, the bonds of shared blood are stronger than any division of house against house or nation against nation.*
When the Exalt witnesses another Dragon-Blood in risk or danger — physical, social, or otherwise — she may use this Charm to instantly form a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty towards him, or to strengthen such a [[Intimacy|Tie]] by one step. For the rest of the scene, that [[Intimacy|Tie]] benefits as though she’d used this Charm’s prerequisite to swear an oath to assist him. If she Joins Battle or makes an influence roll in this pursuit, she adds ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm bonus dice on the first such roll she makes. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
