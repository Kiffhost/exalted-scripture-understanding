*The Exalt may draw the Essence from a target with a touch.*
If the target possesses a mote pool, the Exalt may touch him and pay one [[Willpower]] to roll ([[Wits]] + [[Lore]]) against his [[Resolve]] (unmodified by [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]), stealing motes equal to the extra successes from his peripheral mote pool (defaulting to personal if their peripheral [[Essence]] is depleted).
In combat, this is a difficulty 5 gambit executed with a hand-to-hand combat Ability of the Exaltâ€™s choice.
