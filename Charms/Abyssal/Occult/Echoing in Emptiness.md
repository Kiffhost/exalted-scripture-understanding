*The deathknight’s voice spans the emptiness between life and death, speaking in a susurrus of maddening whispers.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Screaming in Silence]], she may send her message to up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) different characters. Her Circlemates don’t count against this limit, nor do undead that she’s created or summoned.
If a character has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the Abyssal, the range at which she can contact them is multiplied by ([[Intimacy]]). The same is true for her Lunar mate, who counts as having a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] for this purpose.
[[Whispers]]: Characters with [[Whispers]] don’t count against the maximum the Abyssal can contact, and treat their [[Whispers]] rating as a Tie to the Abyssal to determine the message’s range. If they choose to respond, they may direct it either to the deathknight alone or to all other characters with [[Whispers]] who received the message.
