*The Solar channels [[Essence]] into her steps and motions, insinuating herself into the minds of her audience.*
The Solar winds through the motions of a dance. Roll ({Manipulation or Appearance} + [[Performance]]) with one automatic success against the target’s [[Resolve]]. If successful, the target’s [[Resolve]] or [[Guile]] is lowered by two against the Exalt’s next social influence attempt.
