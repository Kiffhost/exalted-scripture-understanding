Employing deft circumlocutions and subtle innuendo, the Lunar carries on two conversations simultaneously. She appears to speak on one topic, but the subtext of her speech conveys either a single idea or an influence roll, perceived only by those she wishes to grasp her true meaning. Those characters must still understand the language the Lunar is speaking in.
