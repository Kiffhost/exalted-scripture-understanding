As proof of her illimitable soul, the Solar may induct a new infinite god-weapon into the world of mortal matter. When she has ten or more legendary projects under way, she may use this Charm to complete one of them without further rolls or expenditures of craft points. This Charm has a similar function for Artifacts of a lower rating, so long as each of the ten Artifacts is the same rating. This Charm may only be used once per story, and may not be used again until at least half of the current projects have been completed. Prematurely abandoned or failed projects do not count as having been completed. Using this Charm awards no craft points; the finished artifact is its own reward.
