*The stars foretell the coming of the Sidereal’s forces, turning the tide of battle with their unexpected arrival.*
The Sidereal can use Auspicious Recruitment Drive to reveal that reinforcements are on the way, completing the roll instantly. These reinforcements represent soldiers the Sidereal has previously recruited offscreen.
This battle group arrives and Joins Battle at the beginning of the next round in combat. When used this way, the rallied battle group gains an additional dot for every three extra successes the Sidereal has, rather than every two successes, and she can’t spend successes to improve its Drill or Might.
If the Sidereal knows Training Mandate of Celestial Empowerment, the battle group gains that Charm’s benefits. She may reflexively use an Ascending (Caste) Horoscope Charm on one of the battle group’s members, waiving its Willpower cost.
The Storyteller can increase the difficulty of Auspicious Recruitment Drive up to a maximum of 10 if circumstances would make such a turnabout implausible. Even on a successful roll, her player must explain how she arranged for the reinforcements. A Sidereal with Yellow Path (p. 168) can use it reflexively, waiving its Willpower cost, to ignore this.
With an Essence 4 repurchase, the Sidereal’s player can use Auspicious Recruitment Drive reflexively in scenes where the Sidereal isn’t present, revealing that she and her forces are on the way. This can only be used once per story, even if the Sidereal resets Auspicious Recruitment Drive.
