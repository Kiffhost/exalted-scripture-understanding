Once per day, the sorcerer can elevate herself into a state of mystic sympathy after dancing in ecstatic whirls for at least a few minutes. She gains (Performance) sorcerous motes that last until she next sleeps or uses this ritual again. While she holds these motes, she counts as having the Major Principle “I must embrace and express joy.” Acts of chaos and destruction count as expressions of joy for this Intimacy. She loses all gathered motes if she violates this Intimacy and cannot perform the ritual until she completes a serious task which affirms her commitment to it.
