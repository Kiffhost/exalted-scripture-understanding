Legendary Size has the following benefits:
- Smaller enemies’ attacks don’t inflict onslaught penalties. (Magically inflicted onslaught penalties still apply.)
- The character can’t be reduced below Initiative 1 by smaller enemies’ withering attacks unless they have 10+ post-soak damage dice. Such attacks still award the full amount of Initiative damage rolled.
- The character can’t take more than (attacker’s Strength + 3) levels of damage from smaller enemies’ decisive attacks. Levels of damage added by magic don’t count against this limit.
- The character can’t be grappled by smaller enemies unless they use magic like Titan-Murdering Grasp. Such magic is also necessary for them to resist her grapple control rolls. 
- The character can’t be knocked back by smaller foes’ smash attacks and is more difficult to knock back with magic (Exalted, p. 274).
