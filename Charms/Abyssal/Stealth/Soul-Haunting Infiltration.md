*The deathknight sinks into her victim’s shadow with a wicked grin, making him nothing more than a shadow puppet dancing on her strings.*
The Abyssal can use [[Shadow-Pinning Strike]] to hide in an enemy’s shadow instead of pinning it. When she successfully grapples an enemy within close range, if her ([[Wits]] + [[Stealth]]) roll also beats his [[Resolve]], she can use this Charm, entering his shadow.
Infiltrating an enemy’s shadow gives the Abyssal control of his motor functions and senses, letting her act through him. His actions still use his own traits and the Abyssal can’t use her magic to enhance them or force him to use his own magic. The Abyssal can’t compel him to act against his Major or Defining Intimacies, requiring her to use bargain, persuade, or threaten rolls as usual against him.
The Abyssal’s influence can convince her host to take actions that will cause life-threatening harm, ignoring the usual rules for unacceptable influence, but she suffers any damage that he does. If he successfully asserts his [[Resolve]] against such influence or spends [[Willpower]] to resist it, this Charm ends.
While the Abyssal is within her victim’s shadow, she counts as being in concealment. Other characters can’t perceive or interact with her unless they have magic applicable to possessing spirits and similar beings. She can be exorcised by magic like [[Burning [[Exorcism]] Technique]] (Exalted, p. 356), though she’s not subject to any other effects such magic imposes on exorcised spirits.
