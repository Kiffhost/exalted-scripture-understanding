Even if a murderer washes the blood from his hands, the smell of iniquity that clings to his heart draws the magistrate to him. The Dragon-Blood doubles 9s on an Awareness, Investigation, or Survival roll to detect the presence of a character that has made a Larceny roll in the last (Essence) hours. She can determine whether or not a given individual is the source of the guilt by successfully profiling him.
