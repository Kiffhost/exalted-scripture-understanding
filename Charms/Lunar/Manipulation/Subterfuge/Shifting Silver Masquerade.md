The Lunar convincingly inhabits countless roles, intuitively realizing and correcting any missteps. If she acts out of character while disguised, allowing other characters to make new rolls to spot her [[Tell]] or see through a disguise, 1s on those rolls subtract successes. Alternatively, this Charm can add a non-Charm success on an acting-based [[Performance]] roll with any Attribute.
