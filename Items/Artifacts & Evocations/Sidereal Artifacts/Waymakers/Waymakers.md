These starmetal wind-and-fire wheels are large enough for a small child fit through, though their bladed edges are scarcely thicker than paper. Their hand-grips are carved from a mineral that cannot be found in Creation, each with a delicate recess for a hearthstone. Plaintive Abiona forged them for her Circlemate Unforgiving Lightning to wield against the Sequence of Irreducibles, a chasseur of the Scorpion Empire. The Sequence had folded and encysted itself deep within Creation’s substrate. Its armored scales were distance; its talons, fractal blight. Thus, Abiona forged a weapon that to cut space itself, using the arch of a heavenly gate as a whetstone to hone the Waymakers’ edges. Thus armed, Unforgiving Lightning descended into the Cascade, cutting a clear path through the infested space of its dominion to strike at its heart-lemma. He prevailed, though his right hand was forever warped by its predatory geometries. The Waymakers were returned to Abiona after Unforgiving Lightning’s death in a Silver Pact ambush. Too grief-stricken to bear the sight of them in another Sidereal’s hands, she sealed them away within the Cascade of Irreducibles’ corpse, a strangely-angled maze of envenomed crystal and nacreous porcelain. She’s spread rumors of them as she travels through Creation to ensure they’re found by a worthy wielder, as long as she never has to meet them. 
 
## Evocations of the Waymakers

The Waymakers’ wielder adds one die on withering and decisive damage rolls against fae, and one success on rolls to navigate the Wyld, overcome its obstacles, or contend with magic that warps space or makes it behave unusually, like certain Getimian Charms.
