The Solarâ€™s understanding of corporeal Essence allows her to channel her forces to rend spirits at the point of impact. Breath-Drinker Method supplements a decisive attack, allowing the Solar to steal a number of motes from a spirit equal to the number of health levels damaged by the attack. The Exalt may not steal more than (Essence x2) motes on a single attack.
