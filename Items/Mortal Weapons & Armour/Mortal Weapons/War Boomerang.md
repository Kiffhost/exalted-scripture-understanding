These weapons are curved, flat pieces of sharpened metal or specially hardened ironwood that spin through the air with deadly force. While not normally designed to return, highly skilled characters can perform this impressive feat.
Players of characters who have three or more dots in
[[Thrown]] may make a second, reflexive ([[Dexterity]] +
[[Thrown]]) roll if the boomerang misses its target. If this second roll succeeds, the boomerang curves around and lands within close range of the thrower. If the thrower’s player rolls three or more successes, then the boomerang actually returns to the thrower’s hands.
