The Lawgiver becomes preternaturally adept at navigating through bureaucracies. She can naturally sense who to talk to in order to produce results, who expects or is amenable to bribes, which functionaries are actually useful or friendly and which are officious tyrants abusing their meager sliver of power. The Solar may add her Bureaucracy score to the read intentions actions of any Ability so long as it helps her in producing a desired bureaucratic result, such as obtaining a license, gaining a passport or securing an audience.
