The Solar may call upon her vast stores of knowledge to greatly enhance Wyld-Shaping Technique at phase three or beyond, aiding her roll with double 8s. She may call upon this power during one phase per attempt. A repurchase at Essence 5+ allows her to call on this power during an additional phase, aiding it instead with double 7s.
