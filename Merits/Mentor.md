Another individual of greater experience regularly teaches and advises the character. Mentors may provide advice, assistance, and even training in mundane or magical fields.
A one-dot mentor is an expert within a particular noteworthy field, such as languages, swordplay, [[Templates/sorcery]], or martial arts. A two-dot mentor is an expert in several notable fields, and may be an individual of notable power or influence. A three-dot mentor is a master of many things, as well as a significant regional power or universally respected authority in his areas of expertise.

#### Lunar
Pact Lunars often have a shahan-ya as a three-dot [[Mentor]]. In games where all players are students of one shahan-ya, the Storyteller might give them this Merit for free.

#### Sidereal
Experienced Sidereals are three-dot Mentors. Senior gods of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] are usually two- or three-dot Mentors.

#### Exigent
While an Exigent’s patron is often consumed by her Exaltation, many deities — particularly those of great personal power or rank — survive, albeit diminished. An Exigent’s divine patron can be taken as a three- or five-dot Ally or two- to three-dot [[Mentor]], depending on their personal power
