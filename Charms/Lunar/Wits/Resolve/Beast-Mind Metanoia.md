The Lunar escapes into an animal mind’s simplicity, untouched by philosophers’ nuanced arguments and courtiers’ sophisticated temptations. After her Resolve is overcome by an influence roll, she can use this Charm to momentarily reduce her intellect and cognitive faculties to the level of any animal whose shape she possesses. She retains the ability to understand languages she speaks, but her vocabulary and ability to parse complex sentences may be drastically diminished based on the chosen animal. If the Storyteller deems that the influence is too complex for her diminished mind to understand, she may reject it as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). Alternatively, if the Lunar’s diminished state lets her understand some but not all of the influence, the Storyteller may deem that its effect on her diverges from the opposing character’s intentions accordingly. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by experiencing Limit Break (p. XX). Example: An imprisoned demon successfully persuades Rhanka Three-Toe to retrieve the jeweled sphere that can free it from its prison-shrine. She uses Beast-Mind Metanoia to reduce her cognitive faculties to a dog’s. The Storyteller deems that a dog can comprehend retrieving the sphere, but that using it to free the demon would be entirely beyond it. Thus, the influence only compels Rhanka to obtain the sphere, after which she’s free to do as she pleases with it. 
## Protean 

This Charm only costs five motes, one Willpower if the Lunar reduces her intellect to that of her current animal shape.
