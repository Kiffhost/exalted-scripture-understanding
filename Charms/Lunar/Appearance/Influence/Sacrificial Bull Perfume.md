The Lunar smells of sweet incense and the fragrant smoke of burnt offerings, drawing spirits to her pleasing scent.
The Lunar’s [[Alluring Scent Technique]] affects spirits within medium range of her, in addition to its usual targets. Its effects are heightened against them:  - Spirits with a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the Lunar are also subject to the “No Tie” effect.
 - Spirits with no Tie to the Lunar are also subject to the “Positive Tie” effect.
 - Spirits with a positive Tie to the Lunar also suffer −1 [[Resolve]] against her influence leveraging such ties.
If the Lunar enhances [[Alluring Scent Technique]] with [[Mysterious Stranger Intimation]] or [[New Friend Aroma]], spirits can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist those Charms’ effects unless their [[Essence]] exceeds the Lunar’s.
