*The Abyssal aims not toward her target, but toward his doom, where he will meet her blade.*
The Abyssal makes a withering or decisive attack that ignores [[cover]]. It can even strike through [[Cover#Full|full cover]] as long as an opening exists, but sheâ€™s treated as if attacking from [[Range#Long|long range]].
