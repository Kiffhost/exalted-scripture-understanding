*Guided by predatory instinct, the Lunar becomes one with the flow of battle.*
After crashing a higher-[[Initiative]] enemy, she rolls [[Join Battle]]. If he had a âˆ’2 or greater wound penalty, she adds a free full Excellency on the roll. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack from [[Initiative]] 30+. 
## Totemic 

Lunars with predatory spirit shapes may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm.
