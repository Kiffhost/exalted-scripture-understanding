The Solar enacts a skill which doubles and trebles her body in a shimmering blur, placing it together outside of an attack. Upon successfully applying her [[Defense|Evasion]] the Solar may activate [[Fourfold Shiver Binding]] to raise her [[Defense|Evasion]] score by one for the rest of the scene. This bonus is not stackable, and does not count as dice added by a Charm. [[Fourfold Shiver Binding]] is incompatible with armor.
