*The Shatterbond Knives’ wielder leaves her rival an enduring reminder of their struggles.*
When the wielder deals 3+ decisive damage, she may embed one of the knives in her target, increasing his wound penalty by −1 and adding one die on all attacks she makes against him for the rest of the scene.
Against her rival, she adds (Rivalry/2, rounded up) dice instead.
The victim can pull the knife out with a miscellaneous action, though he suffers (wielder’s [[Essence]]) dice of unpreventable lethal damage. For the wielder’s rival, this increases to (Rivalry) dice if it’s higher, or adds one die otherwise.
If the wielder recalls the embedded knife to her hand, it returns without harming her victim.
## Resonant
When used against the wielder’s rival, he can’t pull out the knife unless she allows it.
