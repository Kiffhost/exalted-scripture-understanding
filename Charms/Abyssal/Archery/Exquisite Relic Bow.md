*The Abyssal’s killing intent takes form as a spectral weapon, a vicious bow of night-black Essence or a flamewand roaring with sickly green pyreflame.*
The Abyssal creates an artifact Archery weapon from Essence. The type of weapon created and its exact appearance are the same each time she uses this Charm.
The deathknight can use Relic Arrow Method’s dice-adding effect to enhance attacks made with the summoned weapon without regard for its once-perscene limit, although each use beyond the first incurs a one-mote surcharge.
This Charm may be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation to the summoned weapon. These Evocations draw their themes and function from the deathknight’s personality, Caste, and iconic anima banner.
