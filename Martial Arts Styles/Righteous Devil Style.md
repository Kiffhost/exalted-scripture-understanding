# [[Righteous Devil Style]]
The Righteous Devil is a figure of burning fury and solemn judgment, a wandering hero who protects the innocent and banishes the wicked into a fiery hell of their own making. Students of the style master the [[firewand]] (p. 589), wielding these exotic weapons with a deadly precision that’s more art than archery. However, the heart of the Righteous Devil style is not in its fiery attacks, but in the judgment that precedes them. When the strong and powerful use their positions to oppress those beneath them, when the selfish put their own needs above those of the community, when the once-righteous turn from their ideals to pursue their own desires—these are the crimes which the Righteous Devil judges most harshly, and his verdict is spoken in cleansing flames. Many students of this style have a [[Intimacy|Principle]] encompassing this code of ethics, though there are some who turn against the moral teachings of their sifus, or who simply learn the martial techniques of the style with no heed for the ethics behind them.
