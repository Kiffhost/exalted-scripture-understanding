# Earth Dragon Style
Earth Dragon style tempers overwhelming force with meticulous deliberation, moving slowly and surely with every technique. Students undergo training regimens that strengthen the body, hardening fists through hours spent striking barrels of gravel and learning to ignore their pain by sleeping on beds of nails. This training tempers them into nigh-invincible warriors who can stand toe to toe with unruly gods and Anathema, withstanding deadly blows and answering in kind with their mighty tetsubos.
## Weapons
Earth Dragon unarmed attacks are solid, powerful strikes delivered with the elbows, knees, or two-handed hammer blows. This style also uses tetsubos. Unarmed attacks enhanced by Earth Dragon Charms can be stunted to deal lethal damage.
## Armour
This style is compatible with all armor.
## Complementary Abilities
Occult is used to battle spirits, while Athletics is employed in feats of strength
