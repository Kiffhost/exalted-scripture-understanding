This Charm allows the Solar to use [[Flashing Edge of Dawn]] in the same instant that she uses [[Fervent Blow]]. If the clash is successful, resolve the counterattack’s attack and add the damage (if any) to that of [[Fervent Blow]] for a single damage roll. Over-and-Under Method’s cost replaces that of [[Flashing Edge of Dawn]] and [[Fervent Blow]].
