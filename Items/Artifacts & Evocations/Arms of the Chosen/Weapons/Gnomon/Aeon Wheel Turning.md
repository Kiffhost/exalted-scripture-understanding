Gnomon trails ribbons of indigo and violet light as the Exalt strikes an enemy â€” and then vanishes. A split-second later, she reappears, repeating the same strike from an instant in the future. This Evocation can only be used while the wielder is at [[Initiative]] 15+, or during the frozen time of [[Step Between Seconds]]. She makes a decisive attack or a gambit, making two attack rolls and keeping the higher result. When enhancing the attack with [[Charms]] or other magic, she need only pay their costs once to enhance both rolls. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 15+ [[Initiative]] from a single withering attack that either crashes an enemy or drops his [[Initiative]] from higher than hers to lower. 

## Dissonant

The wielder cannot use this Evocation outside of the frozen time of [[Step Between Seconds]].
