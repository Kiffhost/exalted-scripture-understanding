Fist swirling with molten fury, the Lawgiver punches her enemy in the heart, rips it out of his chest, and offers it up as a prayer to the divine force that flows through her. This Charm is a decisive gambit with a difficulty of the target’s remaining health levels. If successful, it does exactly enough damage to kill that opponent. The Solar rips her victim’s heart out, then she lifts it to the sky. The last thing they see is their heart going up in a gout of flames as the Solar’s fist closes around it. When the Solar kills a trivial opponent with this Charm, she gains a point of [[Willpower]] and automatically terrifies all other trivial opponents. When she kills a non-trivial opponent with [[Heart-Eating Fist]], she gains no [[Willpower]], but is suffused with a sudden surge of storming transformative anima. As the power of the Unconquered Sun flows through her, she automatically heals (half [[Essence]] rounded up) health levels and may reflexively trigger [[Ascendant Battle Visage]] or [[Burning Sky Apocalypse Strike]] at no cost.

### On [[Heart-Eating Fist]]

The Dragon Kings of old, prehuman worshipers of the Unconquered Sun, used to offer up sacrificial hearts to the Most High. Held aloft against the sunlight, these hearts would burn, signaling the Unconquered Sun’s acceptance of the offering. With this Charm, the Lawgiver offers up the heart to herself. As her fires consume it, she gains a surge of incredible power.
