*Having claimed one victim, the Abyssal assassin returns to the shadows to savor the taste of blood.*
To use this Charm, the Abyssal must be in concealment and must have landed at least one decisive attack this scene. She rolls [[Join Battle]]. Any motes spent to enhance the roll are muted.
With a [[Stealth]] 5 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay two motes whenever she incapacitates an enemy to reset this Charm.
## Reset 
Once per scene.
