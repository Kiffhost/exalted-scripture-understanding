*The deathknight topples even the greatest of foes, slaying titanic beasts with bounding strikes, superior strength, and incomparable speed.*
When the Abyssal attacks a Legendary [[Size]] enemy, she adds an automatic success on the attack roll and ignores the defensive benefits her enemy receives from his size. This doesn’t let her grapple him.
This Charm’s [[Initiative]] cost is waived and it loses the Perilous keyword against enemies the deathknight has a negative Major or Defining Tie toward.
