8/0 SPECIAL ATTACKS ### Miasma of Rot
The first time a living character comes within close range of a corpse-soldier in a scene, he must roll (Stamina + Resistance) at difficulty 4 to resist nausea. If he fails, he loses three Initiative and suffers a −1 penalty on all rolls for the rest of the scene.
### Plaguebearer
Infected wounds left by a corpse-soldier’s bite have virulence 5 (p. 233).
MERITS ### Mindless
Corpse-soldiers treat social influence as unacceptable. In battle groups, they have perfect morale.
The Abyssal need not snuff the flame of contagion entirely, making plague rats of her patients.
When the Abyssal’s treatment cures a patient of a disease, she can choose to still leave him contagious. He suffers no ill effects but remains a vector for contagion.
She can also use this Charm after inflicting a disease with Unsurpassed Plague Kiss, immunizing her victim against it while leaving him contagious.
Diagnosing the disease is impossible without magic like Pitiless Triage Judgment that specifically enhances such rolls. Even then, such rolls still suffer a −4 penalty. This can’t affect incurable diseases like the Great Contagion.
The Abyssal can also use this Charm on herself when she successfully resists exposure to a disease or is cured of it. Its cost is waived when she does so. Unlike her patients, she may choose to suppress the disease’s contagiousness at will.
The Abyssal can stack multiple uses of this Charm, both to affect multiple patients and multiple diseases.
