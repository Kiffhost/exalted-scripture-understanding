In a moment of desperation, the Solar may call upon the fury of nature. Focusing her primal Essence through a mighty shout or the cry of her familiar, the Solar calls upon all natural animals within (Essence) miles that match the species of her familiar. These animals assemble into a Size 2 battle group (see Exalted p. 205) with average Drill — elite if they are pack hunters such as wolves or Lions — and Might 0 unless they are diminutive creatures such as rabbits or squirrels, in which case the amplitude of Solar Essence increases their Might to 2. Outside of combat, this battle group takes around ten minutes to assemble unless the assembled beasts are particularly slow. Battle groups of incredibly fast creatures such as hawks can assemble in less than a minute, as can battle groups composed as creatures who are in the immediate vicinity. In combat, assembly takes a number of rounds equal to eight minus the Dexterity of the average member of the battle group, or a single round if the subjects are all nearby or are incredibly swift. The battle group is led by the Solar’s familiar. If the familiar is not present, the battle group will still instinctively attack targets on the Solar’s behalf, and will attempt to follow her if she moves or attempts to flee or indicates a new target for them to savage. War Charms that directly control battle groups are ineffective at leading such a mob, but Survival Charms that enhance the familiar’s own actions allow it to pass on orders and bonuses from the Solar’s War Charms, such as it is able to understand them. Lastly,atEssence4+,allsuccessfulwitheringattacksmade by this battle group award half the Initiative (rounded up) to the Solar’s familiar, if it is present on the battlefield. This Charm has no effect on the familiars of other characters, spirit animals, or an animal that has a Major or Defining Intimacy of hatred for the Solar.

### On Riotous Cry of the Beast

The backer wanted to use his Survival to call up an army of forest creatures to aid him in battle. I expanded the concept to any creature matching the Exalt’s familiar, and conceptualized it as a battle group and tertiary buff for your familiar. This Charm also allows rather “weak” animals to remain valid choices for a familiar. Players are encouraged to conceptualize a Might 2 animal as moving at tremendous speeds, leaping through the air, and fighting with unusual bravery, just like a Solar. Backer: Kristopher Todd
