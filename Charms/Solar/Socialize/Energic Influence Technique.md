The Lawgiver can seed the minds of others with resounding goodwill or disfavor. This Charm supplements an instill action in which the Solar attempts to raise a target’s Minor [[Intimacy]] to Major, or a Major [[Intimacy]] to Defining. If the instill action is successful, the target also gains a new Minor [[Intimacy]] that reflects the one being increased. Thus a Solar could link “duty to one’s nation” to “appreciation for the captain of the guard.” This Charm fails if the target has Major or Defining Intimacies that directly contradict the proposed Minor [[Intimacy]]. 

## Special activation rules

The player must declare what Minor [[Intimacy]] they plan to tack on before using this Charm. During the instill action, the declared [[Intimacy]] must be a part of the Solar’s pitch.

### On [[Energic [[Influence]] Technique]]

The backer asked for a Charm that would allow him to take the Defining Principle of a character and turn it into a Defining Tie for a related character. For example, if you love your nation, that Charm could automatically make you love your nation’s leader. We deemed this far too powerful effect, and decided to instead go with something a little more hands-on, that allows a Solar to increase favor with someone by using their goodwill, seeding them with an [[Intimacy]] for future use. Note that this Charm can also be used to increase and introduce negative Intimacies. This Charm only moves in one direction, though. You can’t use it to decrease one [[Intimacy]] and raise another.
