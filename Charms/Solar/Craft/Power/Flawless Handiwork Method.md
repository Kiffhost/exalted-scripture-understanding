*The Solar capitalizes on her own genius.*
Her hands and [[Essence]] flow in tune with the spirit of her craft, turning even the shoddiest materials into sublime masterworks. [[Craft]] rolls supplemented by this Charm reroll 10s until 10s fail to appear. At [[Craft]] 3+, this Charm may be repurchased, allowing the Exalt to also reroll 6s until 6s fail to appear.
