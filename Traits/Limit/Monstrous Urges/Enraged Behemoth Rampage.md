The Lunar’s rage boils over into violent fury at the slightest provocation. If she encounters a physical barrier obstructing her goals — a locked door, the guards of a noble she wishes to court, a booby-trapped corridor — she’ll attack it until it no longer impedes her. If she experiences an unpleasant sensory stimulus, she’ll lash out until it ceases. She can refrain from physically harming the objects of her positive Ties, instead attempting to intimidate them into obedience.
This ends if the Lunar sees that her !!actionshavecausedaStorytellercharactertowardwhomshe!! has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] to fear or reject her.
