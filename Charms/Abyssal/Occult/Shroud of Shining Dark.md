*The Abyssal’s anima shrouds her in radiant darkness as the taint of necromancy seeps through it.*
The Abyssal doesn’t lose necromantic motes for going a turn without gathering them. When she takes a [[Necromancy|Shape Necromancy]] action while at glowing anima or higher, she gains +1 [[Defense]] and +(Anima) soak until her next turn.
