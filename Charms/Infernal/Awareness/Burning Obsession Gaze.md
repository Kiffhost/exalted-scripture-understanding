*The Infernal’s eyes burn with hatred and desire. The world cannot help but know her attention.*

The Infernal chooses a specific character she can perceive or a general category of things, like valuable items or wild animals. She can see the chosen subject through solid barriers and other obstructions, as if it were limned with radiance that pierces through solid matter. She can’t see anything that’s more than one range band thick — or two range bands, if she has a Major or Defining Intimacy toward her subject.
### Keys 
#### World-Piercing Radiance (+4m, 1wp)
For a four-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, the Infernal can use this Charm without choosing a subject, seeing through all barriers. The Willpower surcharge is waived while using the indefinite-duration version of Imperious Hellfire Eye.
