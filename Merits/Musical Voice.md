The mutant’s voice has the inhuman timbre of a songbird, trumpeting elephant, or rattling snake. Penalties on her influence rolls from noisy environments are reduced by three, and her voice counts as an exceptional instrument (Exalted, p. 580).

### Drawback
The character suffers a −3 penalty on efforts to disguise her voice or mimic others’ voices.
