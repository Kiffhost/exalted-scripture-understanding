*The Sidereal invokes her intrinsic authority as one of the Maidens’ Chosen to facilitate smooth dealings with the spirit world.*
Gods and elementals count as having Minor Ties of professional respect to the Sidereal; spirits who are enemies of fate count as having one of fear. So long as she and her allies give such spirits no reason to take offense, they must hear her out when she speaks. The imposed [[Intimacy|Tie]] always penalizes summoned spirits’ [[Resolve]] against the Sidereal’s rolls to bind them with magic like [[Summon Elemental]]. A spirit may pay one [[Willpower]] to ignore or interrupt the Sidereal or two [[Willpower]] to initiate hostilities, but still retains the [[Intimacy|Tie]] of respect. If the Sidereal or any of her companions engage in combat, even in self-defense, further spirits may attack without spending [[Willpower]].
