*The Lunar’s jaws stretch impossibly wide to engulf her prey.*
After establishing a clinch with 5+ rounds of control, she swallows her enemy whole. The maximum size of enemy she can devour depends on her current shape’s size: 
- In Legendary [[Size]] shapes, she can devour any enemy without Legendary [[Size]]. 
- In shapes larger than a human, she can devour any enemy smaller than a human. 
- In human-size or smaller shapes, she can only devour enemies with the Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] [[Merits]]. 
- In shapes with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]], she can only devour Minuscule [[Size]] foes smaller than her current form. She suffers none of the usual clinch penalties, but her victim does. He can’t attack anyone but her, and may suffer other restrictions the Storyteller deems appropriate. The Lunar can’t use normal grapple actions against a swallowed foe, other than releasing him by spitting him out. Instead, on each of her turns, he suffers a difficulty 5, damage (Lunar’s [[Essence]])L [[Environmental Hazards|environmental hazard]] from her digestive fluids. If this incapacitates him, she can either spit him out, leaving him alive but unconscious, or fully digest him, killing him and spitting out any indigestible equipment. The Lunar doesn’t lose rounds of control when she’s attacked, although she still does when damaged. If damage reduces her rounds of control to zero, it tears open a hole in her flesh for her victim to escape through, and she suffers an unavoidable level of lethal damage. If she changes into a shape insufficiently large to contain the devoured foe, she reflexively spits him out before completing the transformation.
