**This Ability is necessary to create artifacts.** 

[[Lore]] represents a character’s understanding of the world, covering academic disciplines of history, mathematics, geography, literature, science, philosophy, and similar scholarly pursuits. It can be used both to recall useful pieces of academic knowledge, as well as to perform scholarly research in a library or archive. It is also important in the forging of artifacts and the raising of manses. 

# Background
Players must note the subject of their character’s education when selecting [[Lore]], as this impacts the scope of what the Ability may cover for them— [[Lore]] 5 alone makes the character a world-class savant, but doesn’t mean she knows everything. [[Lore]] areas of expertise can be expanded with specialties and roleplaying.
