Drawing upon the profound connection she shares with her Solar mate, the Lunar speaks eloquently of her passions, revealing what the moon knows of the sun. When she makes an influence roll that upholds her Tie to her Solar mate or involves speaking on his behalf, she adds (Intimacy) dice. If she instills other characters with the same Tie she has toward him, or weakens Ties toward him that have an opposing context, these dice are non-Charm. Additionally, affected characters suffer −2 Resolve against her Solar mate’s next influence roll during that scene. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar is in her Solar mate’s shape, the Resolve penalty can apply against the next influence roll she makes that scene.
