This Evocation can’t be used when the eye on Gorgon’s blade is fully closed. Gorgon leaves a wound that doesn’t bleed, for it turns blood and flesh to stone. A decisive attack made with this Evocation poisons its target on a successful hit. The toxin’s traits are damage 1L/round, duration (Essence + Strength) rounds. If the target has been hit with Stone-Sinew Offensive, its penalty is added to the poison’s duration. The toxin has no base penalty, but each health level lost to the poison gives the target −1 to all Dexterity-based pools and +1 soak as his body petrifies. These modifiers only disappear as the damage is healed; mortals don’t heal this damagenaturally.Ifthetargetacceptsacripplinginjuryto ablate this attack, that injury involves partial petrifaction. 

## Dissonant
