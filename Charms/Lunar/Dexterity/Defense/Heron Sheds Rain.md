Inaninstantofsupremespeed,theLunar’sguardapproachesinfinity.ShecanapplyParryagainstunblockableattacks (but not ambushes). For a two-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge, she rolls [[Initiative]], adding successes to her Parry as a non-Charm bonus. This resets her to base [[Initiative]]. If she uses this Charm with [[Coiled Serpent Strikes]], her [[Initiative]] doesn’t reset until after the counterattack. Alternatively, she can use this Charm, paying its surcharge, to perfectly parry a source of [[uncountable damage]] without resetting [[Initiative]], rendering her immune to a recurring source of [[uncountable damage]] for a scene. She might use her claws to carve out a shelter in which to weather an avalanche, or turn aside a hurricane’s winds with a sword-stroke. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 20+ [[Initiative]] in an instant.
