The Exalt flies with an eagle’s swiftness and a wind-god’s grace. This Evocation permanently upgrades [[Raptor Takes Flight]]. The wearer gains +1 [[Defense|Evasion]] and two bonus dice to combat movement while flying. She moves at 80 miles per hour outside of combat. On activating [[Raptor Takes Flight]], the wearer has the option to immediately launch herself one range band into the air. 

## Resonant

Only a wielder resonant with moonsilver can awaken this Evocation.
