Perception is inextricable from reality; space and time are illusions obscuring the truth. The stylist can use this Charm on her turn to reveal that a character within medium range of her has actually been somewhere within short range of his apparent location all along. Any appearances to the contrary were but a trick of perspective. Against unwilling characters, this requires a difficulty 3 gambit with (Perception + Martial Arts), opposed by their (Manipulation + Integrity) roll. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round, but she can only use it once per turn. If the stylist can see a target in a reflective surface, she can use this Charm on him as long as he’s within (Essence) range bands. Enlightenment: Upon winning Join Battle, the stylist can use this Charm any number of times and without needing gambits against unwilling targets, waiving the Willpower cost of uses past the first.
