Wrapping a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Dancer around her eyes, the Sidereal embodies the affirmations and truths that those around her have waited their entire lives to hear, a measured antidote to all the troubles of their lives. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  She gains a bonus dot of Appearance, which can raise her above Appearance 5. 
-  Her influence rolls to instill positive Ties, weaken negative Ties, inspire positive emotions, or persuade characters by leveraging positive Ties or emotions cost an additional Willpower to resist. Mortals and trivial characters can’t assert Resolve or spend Willpower to resist such influence. 
-  Once per scene, she may waive an Excellency’s cost to reduce the target number of an influence roll that benefits from this Charm. 
-  Characters who can see or hear her gain a Defining Tie of romantic love to her. Characters of incompatible orientation or whose players invoke the Red Rule instead gain a Defining Tie of fascination instead. Ignoring her imposes a −3 penalty on rolls opposing her and −1 Defense and Guile against her. Trivial characters can’t opt to ignore her. 
-  If she knows Perfection in Life (p. XX), she reduces its cost to five motes. The Sidereal is blinded by the prayer strip, suffering a −3 penalty on vision-based rolls. She can’t remove it without ending this Charm.
