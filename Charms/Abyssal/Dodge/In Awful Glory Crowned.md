*The deathknight revels in her enemies’ despair, glorying as they succumb to the freezing weight of their failure.*
If the Abyssal raises an enemy’s penalty from [[Frozen Fears Blossom]] to (higher of his base [[Resolve]] or 3), she can use this Charm to crash him. He’s incapacitated instead if the exploited [[Intimacy]] is Defining or if he’s a mortal, [[Essence]] 1 ghost, or trivial character, surrendering utterly to despair.
Either way, the Abyssal’s victim loses [[Willpower]] equal to the levels of damage dealt by the final use of [[Frozen Fears Blossom]]. If this leaves them without any temporary [[Willpower]], they gain a Defining Tie of obedience toward the Abyssal with intensity equal to that of the exploited [[Intimacy]].
Mortals and trivial characters affected who lose all [[Willpower]] die of despair unless the Abyssal spares them. Such characters always leave a ghost, as do those who die in the same scene this Charm was used.
Their Ties of obedience linger past their death.
