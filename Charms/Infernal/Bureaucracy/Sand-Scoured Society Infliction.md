*The Infernal’s words are a weapon against those who imagine there’s such a thing as justice, laying bare the nasty, brutish truth of society.*

The Infernal curses an organization or other group while interacting with its leader, in its headquarters, or otherwise engaged directly with its leadership or seat of governance. She rolls (Manipulation + Socialize) opposed by the ({Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation} + Bureaucracy) of the organization’s leader. Success afflicts the organization with the following:
- Any structures that it owns or uses are suffused with malevolence. This works like [[Blighted Temple Desecration]], but can affect structures of any size. Additionally, characters within them count as having a negative Minor Tie toward the group and all of its members, within an emotional context chosen by their player.
- Its members suffer −2 Resolve against rolls to instil negative Ties toward the group or its other members or weaken positive Ties to them, unless their Resolve is higher than the Infernal’s roll.
- Its members can’t use positive Ties toward the organization or its other members to oppose the Infernal’s influence rolls with any Ability, unless their Resolve is higher than the Infernal’s roll for this Charm.
- Once per session, the Infernal’s player can inflict an automatic botch on any roll made as part of a part of the organization’s affairs. If the group’s leader has a negative Tie toward the group, the Infernal can inflict (Intimacy) botches per session instead.
- The Infernal can sense whenever group members come into serious conflict as a result of such negative Ties. She doesn’t learn what happened or who was involved, but knows where it happened. Once per day, she may gain one Willpower from this out of smug satisfaction.

The Infernal can renew this Charm at the end of this duration without needing to interact with the organization, but must still make a roll opposing the group’s leader.

This Charm can’t curse a group if its effective Size is larger than a single Size 5 battle group (Exalted, p. 206), but can affect a smaller subset of such a group.

The Infernal can stack this Charm to curse multiple organizations.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used on a given organization once per story.
