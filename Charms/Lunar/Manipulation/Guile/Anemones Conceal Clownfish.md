The Lunar lends an air of mystery to even the most boorish companions, insinuating hidden depths they donâ€™t possess. When she witnesses an ally being targeted by an effect opposing his Guile, she grants him +1 non-Charm Guile. The maximum amount he may raise his Guile with Charms is also increased by +1. If the Lunar uses this Charm to benefit her Solar mate, any motes he spends to enhance his Guile are muted.
