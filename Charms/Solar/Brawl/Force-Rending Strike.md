*The Exalt glances into the aura of violence before her and knows the course of her opponent’s strike, meeting it with a greater violence of her own.*
This Charm allows the Solar to make a reflexive [[Brawl]]-based clash attack(p.202)against an incoming decisive attack. This does not count as the Solar’s combat action.
