*The Infernal pollutes her victim’s Essence meridians with surgical precision, feeding his own blighted Essence into the disease that wracks his flesh.*

The Infernal makes an unarmed (Dexterity + Medicine) gambit against an enemy suffering from disease, at difficulty (2 + disease’s intensity). She doubles 9s on the Initiative roll against enemies she can eat.

Success increases the disease’s intensity by one step and makes her victim lose (Infernal’s Essence) Initiative, plus another point for each of up to (Medicine) extra successes on the gambit’s Initiative roll.

If the disease’s intensity is at Defining, it doesn’t progress to fatality unless the victim is a mortal or First Circle demon. Against others, the victim suffers dice of lethal damage equal to the amount of Initiative he loses, ignoring Hardness.
