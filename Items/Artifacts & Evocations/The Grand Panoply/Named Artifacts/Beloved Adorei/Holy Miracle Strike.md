The fourth Evocation of Adorei allows the Solar to draw on her understanding of a thing in order to cut through it. The Solar holds [[Beloved Adorei]] close to her face and focuses all of her martial skill into the moment of a perfect strike, while Adorei focuses her on the Intimacies required to make the cut, allowing the Solar to channel a perfect, unerring, unstoppable strike. The effects of this Evocation are partly narrative: the Solar canbreakanunbreakablelock,cutthroughtheunbreakable door of a Deathlord’s sanctum, destroy an ongoing spell effect without a sorcerous working, and so on. Using this Evocation to do any of those things requires the Solar to know at least two Defining Intimacies of the being the thing being cut represents. The Solar must channel these into her strike. Once she has used them, they can never be used in this way again. This Evocation does not work to kill other characters, but may be used to do decisive gambits which would break malevolent spells, curses, or Charm effects which are hurting or controlling the target. This too requires using the target’s Intimacies. This Evocation cannot knock someone out of [[Limit Break]] or break the Great Curse.
