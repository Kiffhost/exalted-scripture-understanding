*Snarling fate with a twist of her hand, the Sidereal passes her pain back to her enemy.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm after being hit by a decisive attack but before the damage roll. She makes an unblockable and undodgeable (Stamina + Presence) counterattack, opposed by the initial attack roll’s extra successes.
If the counterattack succeeds, it doesn’t deal any damage. Instead, the Sidereal can redirect levels of decisive damage from herself to her attacker. She can redirect up to one level plus an additional level of damage for every three extra successes she rolls, paying two Initiative for each level she redirects. She does not need to pay this cost until after the damage roll. She can’t redirect more than (Stamina) total levels of damage.
If the enemy’s attack deals no damage, it counts as having missed.
