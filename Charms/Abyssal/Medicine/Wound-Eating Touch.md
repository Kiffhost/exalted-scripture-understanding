*Even the most grievous wounds retreat from the Abyssal’s touch, heeding her dread authority.*
The Abyssal heals ([[Essence]]) levels of non-aggravated damage or converts that many levels of aggravated damage to bashing with a touch. With animated corpses, she heals ([[Essence]] + 2) levels instead.
Mortals treated with this Charm are flooded with necrotic [[Essence]]. They suffer a penalty equal to the levels of damage healed on all rolls until they spend a full day in convalescence.
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by upholding death’s chivalry or a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] by treating a patient. This Charm can’t reset itself.
