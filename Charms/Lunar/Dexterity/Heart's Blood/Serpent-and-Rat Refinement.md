The Lunar has learned the ways of rat and rattlesnake, songbird and alley cat, wearing such humble shapes with effortless grace.
The Lunar gains the following benefits  - She can pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she shapeshifts into an animal form to grant it the Tiny Creature Merit (p. 185). This replaces the Minuscule Size and Legendary Size Merits, if applicable, and waives the need to use Emerald Grasshopper or Towering Beast Form for forms of such sizes.
 - When she uses a Protean Charm that receives a benefit because she is in a shape with Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size, she adds a bonus die on the roll enhanced or created by that Charm. Using multiple Protean Charms on one action doesn’t add additional dice.
 - When she uses Herd-Assailing Gadfly, she adds one die of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage.
 - If she knows Emerald Grasshopper Form, she waives its Willpower cost when she uses it in a shape with Tiny Creature.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has Minuscule Size or Tiny Creature may learn this as a Wits Charm.
