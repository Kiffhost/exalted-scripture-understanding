*The Abyssal rouses bloodthirst in even the meekest of beasts, horse and rider moving as one to kill.*
When she Joins Battle, her mount also gains an amount of Initiative equal to her own and acts on its own Initiative for the duration of the combat. It can attack on its own turn without using up the Abyssal’s attack for the round (Exalted, p. 203).
Using this Charm grants the mount a Minor Tie of hunger towards the living or increases a preexisting Tie’s intensity by one step. If it’s already at Defining intensity, the Abyssal can gain one Willpower when her mount gains Willpower for upholding the Tie in the scene she used this Charm, maximum once per scene.
