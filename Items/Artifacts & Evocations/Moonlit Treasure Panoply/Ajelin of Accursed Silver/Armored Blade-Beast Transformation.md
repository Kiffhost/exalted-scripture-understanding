Ajelin’s cursed metal merges with the Lunar’s own armored shell.
Sheathed With Moonsilver’s armored soak stacks with Invulnerable Moonsilver Carapace’s soak (Lunars, p.
253). The Lunar doesn’t gain this benefit if she’s fused her [[Invulnerable Moonsilver Carapace]] with other armor.
## Resonant
The Lunar can use [[Invulnerable Moonsilver Carapace]] reflexively when she uses [[Accursed Blade Embodiment]].
