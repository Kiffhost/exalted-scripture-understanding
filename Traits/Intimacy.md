Intimacies represent loves, hatreds, ideals, and goals—the things in this world people feel strongly about. **Intimacies are important to [[Social Influence#Social Actions|social influence actions]], as they help determine what kinds of influence will affect your character.** They come in two basic types: [[#Tie]] or [[#Principle]]. The basic mechanical function of Ties and Principles is identical, but some [[Charms]] and other special rules may differentiate between them. 

Intimacies come in three levels of intensity: [[#Minor]], [[#Major]], and [[#Defining]].

Intimacies help characters to regain [[Willpower]], and govern what actions they can be persuaded to take via [[Social Influence]].
# Rating

[[Charms]] will sometimes become empowered by Intimacies, such as by granting a character extra strength to fight to protect his loved ones. In these circumstances, a Minor intimacy is "valued at" 2 points, Major 3 and Defining 4—thus, a Charm granting dice equal to an Intimacy’s rating would grant 3 dice if keying off of a Major [[Intimacy]]. 
# Tie

Ties describe your character’s attachments to people, objects, organizations, and other concrete entities. They have an emotional context which describes your character’s feelings towards that entity. Ties are generally written as the subject of the Tie, followed by a parenthetical clarifier to establish context. Examples include:
- *Great Forks (Hometown affection)*
- *My mysterious benefactor (Wary respect)*
- *My wife (Love)*
- *Peleps Deled (Hatred)*
- *The Immaculate [[Order]] (Admiration).*
# Principle

Principles describe your character’s beliefs and ideals. Principles are generally written as a statement of the Principle. Examples include:
- *Honesty is my watchword*
- *Pragmatism rules my actions*
- *The Immaculate Philosophy is the true guide to righteous living*
- *I believe everyone looks out for number one.*
# Gaining Intimacies

Characters may gain new Intimacies in several ways, all subject to Storyteller approval. The key to changing Intimacies is that the change must make sense given the roleplaying going on during the scene and in the broader context of the story. Characters can’t gain beneficial new Intimacies if it doesn’t match how they’ve been played.
- Intimacies can be created at Minor intensity or strengthened by one level by the [[Social Influence]] of other characters. 
- Whenever the player feels it is appropriate and the Storyteller agrees, the character may add a new Minor [[Intimacy]] or intensify an existing [[Intimacy]] at the end of a scene by one degree. 
- In extraordinary situations, the character may gain a new [[Intimacy]] at Major or Defining Intensity based on the events of the story

when an Abyssal murders your brother, it’s probably acceptable to go straight to a Major or Defining Tie of hatred toward him.

## Special note
Because your Intimacies are the key to avoiding [[Social Influence|influence]] you absolutely cannot abide (as described in [[Social Influence#Resisting]], it’s important to spend a few moments thinking about good “safety net” Intimacies when making your character. For example, if the idea of your character violating his sworn oath is antithetical to how you imagine him, you probably want a Major or Defining Principle along the lines of “My word is my bond” or “Once I give my word, I never go back on it.”
# Losing Intimacies

Losing Intimacies is similar to [[#Gaining Intimacies|gaining them]], and likewise subject to Storyteller discretion.
- Intimacies can be degraded by one level or removed entirely (if Minor) by the [[Social Influence]] of other characters.
- Whenever the player feels it is appropriate *and the Storyteller agrees*, the character may remove a Minor [[Intimacy]] or degrade an existing Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] at the end of a scene. Generally, this should follow several sessions in which the subject of the [[Intimacy]] hasn’t come up—characters should rarely drop or degrade an [[Intimacy]] right after it has been created, even if the [[Intimacy]] is undesirable. Alternately, this might follow several sessions showing the character resolving or working to conquer unwanted Intimacies, such as Intimacies of fear or hatred. 
- Whenever the Storyteller judges that a player hasn’t reflected an [[Intimacy]] in her roleplaying for a while, she may declare that it has degraded or even disappeared completely. 
This last point is mostly to keep characters from accumulating a lot of Defining Intimacies, which should be reflected in the character’s actions at least once per story. Few characters can sustain the kind of intensity needed for more than a small handful of Defining Intimacies, and the Storyteller’s pruning helps keep down the clutter.

# Intimacies in [[Social Actions]]

Intimacies represent a character’s relationships, beliefs, ideals, and goals. A character’s Intimacies help determine what types of influence will affect him.
## Intensity
See also [[Intimacy#Rating]].

The strength of an [[Intimacy]] is defined by its intensity— Minor, Major, or Defining. When a character is targeted by an influence roll that opposes one or more of his Intimacies, add a bonus to his [[Resolve]] based on the intensity of the most applicable [[Intimacy]]. On the other hand, if one or more of a character’s Intimacies *supports* an influence roll applied against him, then he suffers a corresponding penalty to [[Resolve]] based on the most applicable [[Intimacy]].

If more than one [[Intimacy]] supports or opposes a social action, only the most relevant [[Intimacy]] modifies the target’s [[Resolve]]. 
<details>
	<summary>Example</summary>
For example, If you have a Major Tie of hatred against the Realm, and a Defining Tie of hatred toward Ragara Jirun, and Ragara Jirun tries to convince you to act in support of the Realm, both Intimacies would logically oppose the influence, but only the Defining Tie of “Ragara Jirun (Hatred)” boosts your [[Resolve]], as it has the strongest intensity.
</details>

Sometimes [[Social Influence]] is supported by one [[Intimacy]] and opposed by another at the same time. 
<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
If Righteous Thorn has a Defining Tie of hatred toward the Realm, but the Major Principle “Violence solves nothing,” then an attempt to convince him to support an armed revolt against Realm occupation would face no bonus or penalty to his [[Resolve]] since the two cancel one another out (-3 for the Defining [[Intimacy]] in support, +3 for the Major [[Intimacy]] in opposition).
</details>

The effects of these different Intensities are listed below.

### Minor
**Minor** Intimacies are notable parts of your character’s worldview, but only come into play when the subject of the [[Intimacy]] is directly relevant to her current situation. 

Minor Intimacies are notable relationships or beliefs that have some influence over a character’s actions without being an integral part of who he is. Characters will usually let their Minor Intimacies dictate their behavior in situations where it is directly relevant, as long as it does not act against a stronger [[Intimacy]] or their own self-interest. A man with a Minor Tie of “My Wife (Love)” has a real and profound relationship with his spouse, but it doesn’t have a strong influence on his actions outside the context of his romantic and family life. A peasant with a Minor Principle of “The Immaculate Philosophy” believes sincerely in the teachings of the Immaculate [[Order]], but her reverence has little sway over her non-religious behavior. Minor Intimacies apply a +2 [[Resolve]] bonus against influence rolls that oppose them, or a -1 [[Resolve]] penalty against rolls that align with them. 

### Major
**Major** Intimacies hold more influence over your character, coming into play even if the subject is only indirectly or tangentially related to the situation at hand. 

Major Intimacies are relationships or beliefs that influence the way the character acts in many areas of life. Major Intimacies influence the behavior of characters even in situations where they are only tangentially or indirectly relevant, and might lead a character to act against their own self-interest as long as they do not face severe harm or life-altering inconveniences because of it. A man with a Major Tie of “My Wife (Love)” has a strong relationship that dictates how he acts outside of just the context of the relationship. A peasant with a Major Principle of “The Immaculate Philosophy” applies the teachings of the Immaculates to almost every aspect of her life. Major Intimacies apply a +3 [[Resolve]] bonus against influence rolls that oppose them, or a -2 [[Resolve]] penalty against rolls that align with them.

### Defining
**Defining** Intimacies hold sway over every aspect of your character’s life—they’re the pillars of her worldview, and often things she would lay down her life to protect. Defining Intimacies should come up at least once per [[Time#Story|Story]].

Defining Intimacies represent the most important things in a character’s life, the relationships or beliefs that they place above all others and refuse to compromise. Defining Intimacies influence the greater part of a character’s behavior in all fields of life. If there’s something for which a character is willing to lay down his life, then it is best represented by this level of intensity. A man with a Defining Tie of “My Wife (Love)” is not just a committed spouse; his relationship influences almost everything he does. A peasant with a Defining Principle of “The Immaculate Philosophy” is defined as a person by her reverence for Immaculate tenets. Defining Intimacies apply a +4 [[Resolve]] bonus against influence rolls that oppose them, or a -3 [[Resolve]] penalty against rolls that align with them.
