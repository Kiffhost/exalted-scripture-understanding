*One day, even Adorjan will be outpaced by her Green Sun Princes as they hasten to revenge.*

The Infernal automatically succeeds on a rush. She moves with such speed that any trivial character whom she came within short range with on her turn is killed instantly, torn to ribbons of flesh.

The Infernal can also use this Charm on an opposed Athletics roll in a test of speed, annihilating any trivial characters who dare oppose her. However, she can’t use it if she’s trying to escape someone.

If multiple characters use this Charm or a similar effect in a test of speed, each of them counts as having rolled one success more than the highest number of successes on any one roll.
