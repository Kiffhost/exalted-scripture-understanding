*The Sidereal is never caught unprepared, forearmed by her prescient sense for danger.*
The Sidereal readies a weapon or dons armor instantly. This doesn’t entail any action on her part; instead, it’s revealed that she anticipated this conflict and had the weapon or armor handy, perhaps hiding it under her clothes.
