It’s the nature of water to flow past obstacles unchanged. The Dragon-Blood sloughs off the physicality of flesh, her body becoming fluid and translucent for as long as she remains in Water Aura. With her movement action, she may attempt to flow through locked doors, cracks in walls, or any other obstruction that isn’t waterproof — passing through the bars of a jail cell, flowing under a door, or pouring herself through a crack in a wall. This also lets her escape any grapple not enhanced by magic. If this Charm ends while she’s in a space too narrow to contain her, she’s forcibly shunted back to where she entered it, and suffers a level of unpreventable bashing damage. The Dragon-Blood’s watery form is more difficult to damage, granting her +1 Evasion. If she’s unarmored, she also gains (Essence + 1) hardness. She adds (Essence/2, rounded up) bonus successes on all Stealth rolls. If she attempts to hide underwater, these don’t count as a Charm bonus. This Charm can only be used once per day.
