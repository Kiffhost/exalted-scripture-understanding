*The Abyssal’s artistry lays bare the futility of mortal striving and the fleeting transience of joy.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Magnificent Cenotaph Allure]], she can convey an [[instill]] roll to weaken certain positive [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. She can target either positive [[Intimacy|Tie]]s to a specific object, like “the [[Scarlet Dynasty|Realm]],” or positive [[Intimacy|Principle]]s related to a certain subject, like “positive outlooks on life.” The [[Storyteller]] should be flexible in applying this — for instance, if the Abyssal targets positive [[Intimacy|Ties]] to the [[Scarlet Dynasty|Realm]], her influence could also undermine positive Ties to the [[Scarlet Dynasty]]. Some viewers may be unaffected if they lack sufficient context — a portrait depicting a prince’s famed defeat in battle would mean little to someone who’s never heard of him. Affected characters can’t use the weakened [[Intimacy]] to strengthen their [[Resolve]] or in [[Decision Points]] until they’ve recovered [[Willpower]] from resting.
