Few can endure the othermoon’s killing cold for as long as Bright Withering did.
The wielder may pay a three-mote surcharge when she uses [[Cold Breath of the Moon]] against an enemy still suffering the penalty from a previous use of that Evocation.
This increases the decisive damage bonus to +2 dice and the withering bonus to +(higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice.
An enemy damaged by the attack loses one [[Initiative]].
## Resonant
The wielder gains the [[Initiative]] lost by her enemy after she resets to base.
