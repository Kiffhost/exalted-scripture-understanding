*The Lunar draws power from her spiritual ties to her territories, evoking miracles from her sacred domain.*
The Lunar can awaken [[Evocations]] from territories. Their themes can draw on the territory’s history and chosen qualities and the Lunar’s character concept, Caste, and spirit shape. She need not be within a territory to use its [[Evocations]], though many are most powerful when used within her territory. Upon purchasing this Charm, she awakens a single territory Evocation for free.
If a Lunar abandons a territory, she loses its [[Evocations]] and is refunded their experience cost. Likewise, if changes to a territory render one or more [[Evocations]] thematically inappropriate, she loses those [[Evocations]] and is refunded their experience cost.
