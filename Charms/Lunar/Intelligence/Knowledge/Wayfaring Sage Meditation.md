*The Lunar gleans vital lessons from hard-won experience.*
Once per session, when she uses intellect, cunning, [[sorcery]], or ties with otherworldly beings to uphold a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]], accomplish a major character or story goal, or achieve a legendary social goal, she gains a [[Lore]] background (Exalted, p. 237) in a topic related to her accomplishment.
Once per story, the Lunar may purchase a specialty in [[Bureaucracy]], [[Craft]], [[Investigation]], [[Larceny]], [[Linguistics]], [[Medicine]], [[Occult]], [[Socialize]], [[Survival]], or [[War]] that’s the same as one of her [[Lore]] backgrounds for only one experience point.
