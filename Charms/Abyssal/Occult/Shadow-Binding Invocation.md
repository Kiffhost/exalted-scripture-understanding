*Death’s Lawgiver bids the Underworld’s shades attend her with a word that can only be whispered, beckoning them even into the sunlit realm of the living.*
The Abyssal causes a spirit she’s bound with a spell or claimed as her familiar to materialize, as long as it can hear her invocation. He pays no cost to do so.
