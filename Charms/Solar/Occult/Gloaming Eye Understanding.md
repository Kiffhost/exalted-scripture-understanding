The Solar channels her Essence into a perfect medium. At the center of day and night, she may be taught up to (Essence) spirit Charms that are applicable to the Eclipse anima power. She need not pay experience points to learn these Charms; she maintains the power to perform such magic as long as she keeps motes committed to the effect. Releasing these motes causes knowledge of the Charm to fade. In order to learn these Charms, the Exalt must meet the trait requirements for the Charm, but does not need to have learned the Charm’s prerequisites.
