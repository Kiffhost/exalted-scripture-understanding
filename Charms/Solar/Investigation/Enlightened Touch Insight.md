By touching a piece of evidence and stirring its [[Essence]] with her own, the Lawgiver gains a psychometric vision related to the object. This is a ([[Wits]] + [[Investigation]]) read intention action against a difficulty equal to the number of days since the evidence was placed. If successful, the Exalt feels the exact emotion of the one who left the evidence behind at the moment it was produced.
