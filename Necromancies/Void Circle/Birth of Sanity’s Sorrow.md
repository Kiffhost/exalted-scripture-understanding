*Drowning in shadow of utmost black, the necromancer emerges transformed into a monstrosity that reflects her darkest impulses — strong as sorrow, fleet as fear, armored in tragedy and abhorrence.*
The necromancer undergoes a grotesque transformation, marking them as an avatar of death. She gains four of the following powers or traits, chosen when she first learns this spell.
Banquet of Blood: Blood is drawn to the necromancer, knitting her wounds and quickening her fury.
Once per round, when a character within medium range suffers decisive damage, she can heal one level of non-aggravated damage or gain (2 + target’s base wound penalty) [[Initiative]]. She also gains two bonus −0 health levels, which are the first to be damaged and which refresh at the start of each turn.
Blood-Forged Body: The necromancer’s form swells with meaty sinew. She gains two bonus dots of [[Strength]], which may exceed 5, and may make a reflexive feat of strength with a free full Excellency once per turn.
Cataclysm Mantle: The necromancer is wreathed in balefire and void-stuff. This is an environmental hazard that extends out to short range, with difficulty 5 and Damage 5L/turn. Trivial characters are always slain instantly.
Devastating [[Action]]: On her turn, the necromancer can take a devastating action. She chooses between reflexively activating one Simple-type Charm that creates an attack or reflexively making an attack against an enemy battle group or all trivial opponents within range of her weapon. Neither counts as her attack for the round.
Hundred-Armed Horror: The necromancer grows multiple appendages of flesh, shadow, or [[Essence]].
She rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) to [[Join Battle]], establishing a new [[Initiative]] track. She still takes only one turn per round, but can use either track interchangeably when determining her turn, taking damage, paying costs, or gaining [[Initiative]]. If lands a decisive attack, she resets the track she made the attack with. If this bonus track is crashed, it’s lost. She may pay ten motes and one [[Willpower]] to reestablish it, making another [[Join Battle]] as above.
Legendary [[Size]]: The necromancer gains the Legendary [[Size]] Merit (p. XX).
Monstrous Mien: The necromancer gains 2 bonus dots of [[Appearance]], which may exceed 5, and gains the [[Hideous]] Merit for the duration of the spell. She doesn’t suffer penalties for flurrying attacks with influencer rolls. When she does, a successful attack inflicts −2 [[Resolve]] against her influence roll, while successful influence inflicts −2 [[Defense]] against her attack.
Singularity of Purpose: The silence of the void quiets the necromancer’s mind. She treats any influence that would cause her to stand down, lessen her attack, or hesitate as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). Once per round, she may reduce the [[Willpower]] cost of resisting influence or using a Charm or similar effect by one.
Once per story, when the necromancer’s Incapacitated health level is filled with damage, she may reflexively cast this spell, rolling (current temporary [[Willpower]] + [[Essence]]) to gather necromantic motes.
She can spend her own motes as if they were necromantic motes toward the spell’s cost. If she gathers enough to cast the spell, she also heals her Incapacitated level and gains ([[Essence]]) additional −0 health levels. These levels are the first to be damaged and are lost when filled. If she survives the scene, she cannot regain [[Willpower]] through sleep for seven days, wracked by nightmares of her own neardestruction.
## Control
The necromancer may choose an additional feature for her transformation. Spirits of Creation automatically sense her potential for annihilation, and count as having a Minor Tie of hatred towards her.
## Distortion (15)
A rival may siphon away some of the necromancer’s terrible power, deactivating one of this spell’s special abilities of their choice. This spell may be distorted multiple times, deactivating a different ability each time.
