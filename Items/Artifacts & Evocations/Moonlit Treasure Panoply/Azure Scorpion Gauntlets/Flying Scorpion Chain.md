*With the gauntlet’s blades firmly anchored, the wielder uses their chains to drag herself across the battlefield with incredible speed.*
The wielder fires the blades into a surface or large object within medium range. In combat or other circumstances where failure would be relevant, she must roll ([[Dexterity]] + [[Thrown]]) at difficulty 4. If successful, she pulls herself up to two range bands toward it by retracting the chains. This count as her movement action.
If the wielder moves upward, she can then jump to a nearby surface, grab something protruding from the ceiling or walls, etc. This may require a ({Dexterity or Strength} + [[Athletics]]) roll. If she doesn’t, she falls back to the ground, but the chain slows her descent enough that she doesn’t take damage before the blade comes loose from the surface.
Outside of combat or similar circumstances, the wielder doesn’t need to roll for this Evocation and waives its [[Willpower]] cost.
## Resonant
This Evocation can be flurried. If the wielder flurries it with an attack after completing her movement, she ignores all penalties from flurrying.
## Dissonant
If the wielder uses this Evocation within close range of any enemies, she must reflexively disengage. She uses the initial [[Thrown]] roll’s result instead of making a new roll.
