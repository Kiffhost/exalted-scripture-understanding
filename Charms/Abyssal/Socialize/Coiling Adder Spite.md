*The Abyssal’s spite nurtures grudges silently, filling her words and actions with venomed potency.*
When the Abyssal cites a negative Tie in a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], she treats its intensity as one step higher. If it’s already Defining, the [[Willpower]] cost to resist the influence is reduced by ([[Essence]]).
The deathknight can also increase a negative Tie’s rating when she uses an instant-duration Abyssal Charm that specifically relies on negative Ties. If her Tie is already Defining, adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on any roll made as part of that Charm.
The Abyssal can’t use this Charm with a negative Tie if its object is aware she has that [[Intimacy]], or if anyone present in the scene other than her allies knows of the Tie.
## Reset 
Once per story unless reset when the Abyssal suffers significant harm or defeat at the hands of someone she has a Major or Defining Tie toward. It’s also reset if she suffers a wrong so egregious that she immediately forms a negative Defining Tie toward the perpetrator.
