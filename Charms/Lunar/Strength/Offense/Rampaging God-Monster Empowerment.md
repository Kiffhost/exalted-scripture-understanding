*The Lunar awakens the monster that lurks in her soul, embodying the beast of the apocalypse.*
She rerolls ([[Essence]]) failed dice on decisive damage rolls against lower-Initiative enemies and gains motes equal to the 10s on such rolls, up to a maximum of the motes spent enhancing the attack. 
Against crashed enemies, she rerolls damage-roll 1s until they cease to appear before rerolling other dice. 
This Charm ends if the Lunar is crashed.
