*Bringing together a union of bow, [[Essence]], will, and spirit, the Exalt raises Hunting Hawk with a triumphant cry, and her anima flies free as an enormous, brilliant golden hawk, which joins the Exalt in battle.*
This avatar of the [[powerbow]] immediately rolls [[Join Battle]] and gains its own [[Initiative]] pool. It has the traits of an eagle (p. 563), and is in all ways considered the Solar’s familiar—including being a valid subject for [[Survival]] [[Charms]], even those that permanently empower a familiar. At [[Essence]] 4+, the Solar may pay for Hunting Hawk’s instant-duration [[Evocations]] by spending points of the anima hawk’s [[Initiative]] in place of motes on a two-for-one basis. If the anima hawk is incapacitated, it vanishes and cannot be called forth again until the Solar uses the [[powerbow]] to successfully hunt and slays a deadly beast or monster that challenges her skills as a hunter. During that time, the cost of all of Orichalcum Hunting Hawk’s [[Evocations]] rise by one mote, as the [[powerbow]]’s wounded spirit strives to mend itself.
