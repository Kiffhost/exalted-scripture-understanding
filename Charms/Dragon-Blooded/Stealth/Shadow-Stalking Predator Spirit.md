*The Dragon-Blood moves through the wilderness as its hidden master, stalking her prey unseen.*
Boughs twist to conceal her movement; fragrant flowers and pollen obscure her scent trail. To use this Charm, she must be moving through or hiding behind light foliage, small trees, or comparable vegetation. When an enemy within medium range — or long range, in areas of heavy growth such as thick bamboo groves or forests dense with underbrush — rolls to oppose her [[Stealth]], his 1s subtract successes. When the Dragon-Blood makes an unexpected attack against an enemy within range of this Charm, she may pay one [[Willpower]] and expend her Wood Aura — ending this Charm — to double her attack roll’s threshold successes when calculating the damage of a withering attack, or to add her threshold successes as dice to the damage of a !!decisiveattack.Ifsheconveyspoisonthroughanunexpected!! decisive attack this way, she adds (Essence/2, rounded down) to its duration. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
