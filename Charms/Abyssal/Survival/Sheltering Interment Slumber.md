*The deathknight sinks into the earth to taste the peace denied her by her duty.*
While lying on a soft natural surface likesoil, sand, or peat moss. the Abyssal sinks into it, entering a torpor in which she has no need for sustenance or air.
The Abyssal can choose to remain in this torpor until a set amount of time has passed or she’s fully healed from all damage. She can still make [[Perception]] rolls to observe her surroundings in this state, though she suffers a −4 penalty and can’t use non-Excellency [[Charms]]. She can end this Charm and wake prematurely in response to external stimuli. Upon waking, she immediately bursts from her resting place, fully alert.
Rolls to detect the Abyssal while she’s entombed suffer a −4 penalty. A dedicated work team with shovels can find her after a day of search, or several days in poor circumstances — though they’ll still have to face the enraged Abyssal once they do. If a deathknight habitually uses this Charm in her travels, any tracking rolls suffer a −1 penalty from the gaps in her trail.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can use [[Wound-Absorbing Discipline]] (p. XX) reflexively when she uses Sheltering Internment Slumber, reducing that [[Charms]] cost by five motes.
