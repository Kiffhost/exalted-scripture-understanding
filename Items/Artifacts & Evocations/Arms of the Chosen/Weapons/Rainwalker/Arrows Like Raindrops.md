As wind changes rain’s direction, Rainwalker’s tempestuous [[Essence]] attracts arrows to glance harmlessly off it. This Evocation adds +2 [[Defense|Parry]] against an attack made from short range or beyond. If the wielder took a full defense action on her last turn or is using her [[Defense|parry]] to protect another character from a ranged attack with a defend other action, this is a non-Charm bonus. 

## Resonant

This Evocation’s duration is extended to one tick.
