*The Abyssalâ€™s weapon arcs from one target to the next in a single bloody swath.*
The Abyssal makes withering attacks against each of up to ([[Dexterity]]) targets, rolling a separate attack for each foe, followed by a decisive attack against a different enemy. However, if one of her withering attacks misses or deals less damage than the last attack, she skips over the rest and immediately makes the final decisive attack.
