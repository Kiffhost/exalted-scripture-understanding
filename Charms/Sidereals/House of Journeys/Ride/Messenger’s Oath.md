Making a silent promise to Mercury, the Sidereal leashes herself to her obligations. Upon accepting a task, responsibility, or mission, the Sidereal gains a Minor Principle for completing it loyally and diligently. The [[Intimacy]] can’t be weakened or altered by any means and influence opposing it suffers +1 target number. Any mount ridden by the Sidereal gains her [[Intimacy]] and this benefit. This Charm normally can’t be ended voluntarily, though the Sidereal can end it to swear to a more demanding task. If ends when the Sidereal fulfills her obligation or when fulfilling it becomes impossible or narratively irrelevant. Success counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX); failure causes her to lose one [[Limit]].
