*Dragonfly Finds Mate Catching her enemy’s flame with the barrel of her own firewand, the Dragon-Blood steals it for herself.*
When she uses [[Dragonfly Finds Mate]] with a firewand, she adds ([[Essence]]) dice to clash attacks made using another firewand, a fire-based attack, or a magical attack made of pure [[Essence]] or other energy such as [[Blazing Solar Bolt]], and may do so even if her weapon is unloaded. Winning the clash reloads her weapon, which visibly burns with stolen flame until she discharges it. Such uses of [[Dragonfly Finds Mate]] are both Fire- and Wood-aspected.
