The Dragon-Blood channels her anima into a puissant manifestation of her Aspect’s element. An [[Air Aspect]] might surround herself with a nimbus of crackling lightning; a [[Wood Aspect]] could conjure a swirling vortex of cherry blossom petals; countless fragments of stone might orbit an [[Earth Aspect]]. This Charm’s elemental aspect is the same as the Exalt’s. Drawing from this manifestation enhances her [[Elemental Bolt Attack]] when she uses it with her Aspect’s element:  - Its cost is reduced by three motes.
 - When a Simple or Reflexive Charm lets her make an [[Archery]] or [[Thrown]] attack, she can reflexively use [[Elemental Bolt Attack]] to make it.
 - She can use [[Elemental Bolt Attack]] reflexively to defend against an attack with a display of elemental power, applying a [[Defense|Parry]] rating of ([Dexterity + Ability]/2, rounded up, + 1). Either [[Archery]] or [[Thrown]] may be used.
 - In her Aspect’s Aura, she waives the anima cost to extend the range of her elemental bolts.
