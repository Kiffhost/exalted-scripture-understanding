The Infernal can slash with metallic claws, burn with a fiery gaze or crush her foes with grinding spires of basalt that rise from the ground. She chooses an (Attribute + Ability) pool appropriate for her form of attack and the traits of any artifact weapon for it.

If the Infernal chooses a non-combat Ability, she can’t use any of that Ability’s Charms to enhance attacks except for the Excellency. Instead, she can use Charms from a combat Ability of her choice that fits her attack’s nature — e.g., if she rolls Performance to attack with needles of rhapsodical sound, she could choose to make it compatible with Archery or Thrown.
