*The Dragon-Blood is everywhere and nowhere in the sea of crime.*
Such is her criminal ingenuity and masterful deception that she leaves no trace of her passage. Whenever an investigator rolls enough successes to uncover a piece of evidence she’s concealed, she may use this Charm to oppose the investigator’s roll with a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Larceny]]) [[conceal evidence]] roll, doubling 7s. If she beats his roll, his attempt fails, and whatever evidence she left behind dissolves away into water, rendering future attempts futile. While the evidence is erased, the vanished secret drifts through the mysterious flows of Water [[Essence]], finding itself drawn to the Dragon-Blood. A successful use of this Charm marks her with a swirling tattoo of black jade over her heart chakra. If the tattoo is revealed, witnesses may attempt a difficulty 3 ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll to realize the Dragon-Blood has used this Charm. [[Infallible Alibi Approach]] can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) through criminal or underhanded means. Once the Charm resets, the incriminating tattoo vanishes.
