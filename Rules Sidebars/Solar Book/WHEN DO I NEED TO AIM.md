Characters at medium or long range must typically take an aim action before they can attack. But this is not always true. A character does not need to aim if:
1. She is casting a spell. 
2. She is using a Charm from an Ability or martial art that is not typically ranged to create a ranged attack. Examples: Apocalypse Flare Attack (p. 283), Blazing Solar Bolt (p. 353). 
3. The ranged Charm in question is triggered by some event, objective, or dice result and must be performed instantly. Typically this type of Charm is Reflexive, but not all Reflexive Charms qualify. Examples: Fallen Weapon Deflection (p. 417), Savage Wolf Attack (p. 419). 
4. The ranged Charm in question creates bonus attacks or immediate attacks as a reward for a good dice roll, and it wouldn’t make sense for such attacks not to happen instantly. Example: Swarm-Culling Instinct (p. 416). 
5. If a Charm resets her combat action. 
6. If a Charm states she can waive the aim action.

# Aim
The character spends a few moments taking aim at his intended target. The player must declare which target he is taking aim at when he uses this action. Should his character attack that target on his next turn, the attack gains a +3 bonus. If the target moves out of the weapon’s range or behind [[Cover#Full]] before the character’s next turn, this action is wasted. 

An aim action is required before an attack can be made from [[Range#Medium]] or greater, even one assisted by magic; attacks from medium or greater range don’t gain a +3 bonus unless two consecutive turns are spent aiming. 

**Characters cannot move and aim during the same round without some form of magic to permit it. This action cannot be placed in a flurry.**
