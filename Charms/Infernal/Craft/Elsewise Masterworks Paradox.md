*The Infernal draws forth a wonder from thin air — something that she might have created, but never did.*

The Infernal manifests a two-dot artifact out of nothingness. She must have at least one dot of Craft (Artifact). Such artifacts bear all the hallmarks of her crafting, but their aesthetics and design are sometimes strange and subtly unnerving, perhaps even to the Infernal herself. She receives five gold points as long as this satisfies a basic objective.

With Essence 5, the Infernal can use this Charm to create three-dot artifacts.
## Reset
Once per story. The Infernal can reset it by completing a project to create an artifact or manse.
