*The deathknight grants her enemy the mercy of a swift release from her grasp, sending him to meet his end.*
When the Abyssal throws a grappled enemy, she can hurl him out to short range, and adds an additional +2 dice of [[Attack#raw damage|raw damage]] for each round of control she expends. If she uses this Charm after grappling an enemy with [[Titan-Murdering Grasp]], she can throw even Legendary [[Size]] enemies.
With [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal can expend two rounds of control to extend the throw’s range to medium, inflicting damage as a short-range [[Falling|fall]]. These rounds of control don’t add to the throw’s damage. Alternatively, she can expend four rounds of control to throw her enemy to long range, inflicting damage as a medium-range fall.
