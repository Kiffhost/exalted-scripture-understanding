The martial artist scurries along the strands of fate like a pattern spider, moving with disturbingly inhuman grace. The stylist can stand on thin air, finding footholds in the weave of fate, and can move vertically by running upward. Any movement action rolls she makes also count as threaten rolls against all enemies and bystanders â€” the way she moves is wrong, not how human limbs should move. Affected enemies flee the stylist or otherwise seek safety. Enlightenment: When the stylist uses this Charm, she may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to dematerialize for its duration, becoming unable to interact with the material world or be harmed by it without the use of magic.
