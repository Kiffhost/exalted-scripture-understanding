A sorcerer with an Essence pool may spend a scene in meditation to commit ten motes to the talisman. Once she begins shaping a spell while wearing the talisman, she may draw on the power she’s invested, contributing up to (Essence + 2) sorcerous motes towards the spell until the full commitment of ten motes has been converted into ten sorcerous motes, or the spell is cast (or countered). Committed motes are converted to sorcerous motes on a one-to-one basis normally, but are converted into two sorcerous motes when casting the sorcerer’s control spell. The sorcerer must wait until she’s had a full night’s sleep before she can charge the talisman again.
