*No.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have zero temporary Willpower. She can use it when her Resolve is beaten by an influence roll that opposes a Defining Intimacy or a Psyche effect. She reflexively enters her [[Devil-Body]] and perfectly defend against that effect. Against a Psyche effect, she becomes immune to that power for the rest of the scene.

If the opposing roll fails to beat the Infernal’s Resolve, she gains one Willpower for each success it failed by, maximum (higher of Essence or 3).

This Charm is subject to the usual once-per-story limit on [[Devil-Body#Devil-Body Apotheosis|Devil-Body Apotheosis]] (p. XX).
