The Exalt can make out the minute traces of writing that was once readable but has now been damaged or erased. Examples include palimpsests, water-soluble inks that have been left in the damp, and stone monuments that have been rendered unreadable by vandalism or the elements. This Charm cannot read the writing on inscriptions that have been crushed into sand or letters that have been burned to ashes. This Charm does not convey the ability to understand a language the Solar cannot normally read, but she may use this Charm in concert with Flawless Brush Discipline to make a perfect, undamaged copy of the original script for later translation.
