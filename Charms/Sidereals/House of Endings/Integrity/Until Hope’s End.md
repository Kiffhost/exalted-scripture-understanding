*All hopes must end, but until they do, the Sidereal clings fiercely to hers.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits
- Her hopeful Intimacies increase their Resolve bonus by one.
- Once per day, she can lower the Willpower cost to resist an inspire roll to create despair by one.
- While acting in accordance with a hopeful Intimacy, she adds (Intimacy) to her Stamina to determine how long she can go without food, air, and water.
- If a hope expressed by one of her Intimacies is decisively thwarted, it counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. 132).
