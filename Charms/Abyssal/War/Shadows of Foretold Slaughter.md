*Creation itself weeps for the bloodshed to come at the deathknight’s hand, ripping open a shadowland as her dreaded legion takes the field.*
The Abyssal makes a [[Strategic Warfare|Strategic Maneuver]] roll with double 7s to enact a unique magical stratagem with threshold 4. Enacting the stratagem causes a shadowland to open across the battlefield as combat begins, and also carries the effect of a [[Demoralized]] stratagem.
If the Abyssal’s forces are already fighting in a shadowland or the Underworld, this stratagem instead enhances allied undead battle groups. The bonus dice their [[Might]] adds on attack rolls are converted to automatic successes, and they add their [[Might]] to their [[Size]] when determining their [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] (Exalted, p. 208).
This shadowland doesn’t always linger after the battle’s end, but using this [[Charms]] make it far more likely that the fight will result in a permanent shadowland forming.
## Special activation rules
When the Abyssal uses [[Peerless Immortal Strategist]], she may use this Charm reflexively, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost, to add its stratagem to her options.
## Reset 
Once per story unless reset by unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through warfare.
# #custom/note 
Replaced the unknown prerequisite [[Flickering Phantom Phalanx]] with [[Janissary-Wraith Conscription]]. THIS MAY BE FALSE
