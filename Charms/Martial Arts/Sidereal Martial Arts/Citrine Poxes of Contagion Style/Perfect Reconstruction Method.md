The martial artist batters her patient’s body back into alignment with the patterns of his Essence. The stylist makes a gambit to heal herself or another character, rolling Join Battle to calculate Initiative if she uses it outside of combat. The Initiative roll’s difficulty equals (5 + patient’s total levels of damage); no attack roll is necessary unless he’s unwilling. Success heals (Medicine + extra successes) levels of non-aggravated damage or converts that many levels of aggravated damage to lethal damage, maximum (her Essence + her Medicine + patient’s Essence) levels. If the stylist knows other Charms that can heal damage or grant temporary health levels to other characters in combat, she may use them reflexively with this Charm, waiving Willpower costs, to extend their benefits through the gambit as well. If they require a roll, she uses her Initiative roll instead. The stylist likewise waives the Willpower cost of Charms like Instant Treatment Methodology that let her use such Charms in combat.
