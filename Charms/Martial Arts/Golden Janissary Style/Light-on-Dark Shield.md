No shadow intrudes upon the light. Spinning her weapon to build momentum, the stylist clashes an attack with her own withering attack. Her attack cannot deal more damage than (her Overwhelming), which she doesn’t gain. Against creatures of darkness, a successful clash also rolls one die of aggravated damage, ignoring Hardness. CREATURES OF DARKNESS Creatures of darkness are foes of Creation who stalk through the night or dwell in the dark places of the world. This includes demons and undead by default, but the Storyteller is free to include or exclude beings from this category at her discretion. A benign ancestor ghost might not be a creature of darkness, while a subterranean monstrosity empowered by forbidden gods could be.
