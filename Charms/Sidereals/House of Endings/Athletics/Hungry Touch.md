The Sidereal consumes an object’s future, bringing about its inevitable destruction early. The Sidereal performs a feat of demolition simply by touching an object. Lengthy feats, like bashing through a thick stone wall, are completed instantly if the Storyteller deems it feasible; if not, the time required to complete it is divided by the Sidereal’s (Strength + Athletics). In combat, a successful feat awards one Initiative if the feat changes the scene in the Sidereal’s favor. This Charm can’t be used to destroy objects worn or wielded by enemies, but an Athletics 4, Essence 2 repurchase removes this limit.
