Burning Branch entangles enemy weapons mercilessly. After parrying an attack from close range, the wielder may use this Evocation to counterattack with a disarm gambit (Exalted, p. 200). If the spear’s head is ignited, SHOU REN, SORCERER-PRINCE OF THE HIDDEN WORLD Asphodel’s bearer knows its resident scholar-shade solely through his voice — cool, collected, laced with bone-dry wit. Shou Ren is always happy to speak to the Exalt; despite absolute mastery of the hidden world, he is deprived of stimulation, craving both new lore from Creation and opportunities to converse with the living. In exchange, he freely shares his erudition and wisdom. As one born into the First Age, Shou Ren’s historical knowledge is invaluable to those of the [[Time]] of Tumult, but his expertise relates primarily to matters of scholarship. Asked of the dawn times, he speaks of life in a city of shimmering carnelian and burning gold, of the tyranny of the Queen of Eyes and the lost libraries of sacred Beriah. Beyond that, he is as limited to secondhand accounts and anecdotes as any other savant or ancient. Shou Ren is an initiate of the Terrestrial Circle of [[sorcery]], and knows a wide range of spells. Sample shaping rituals for a wielder who learns [[sorcery]] from him include the second and third shaping rituals for the Talisman of Ten Thousand Eyes linked to [[Asphodel]], or the Heptagram shaping ritual (Exalted, pp. 470-471). Should the hidden world’s gates be breached and its prince cornered, his personal prowess is roughly on par with a nephwrack’s (Exalted, pp. 506-508). The soulsteel crown Shou Ren wears is an artifact that manifests his authority within the hidden world. It cannot be taken from him so long as he exists. Should he be destroyed, another ghost of significant supernatural or sorcerous power can attune the crown and become the new prince in the jewel, assuming his role for purposes of counsel and bargains.

[[Time]]-Worn Soul: Shou Ren gains +2 [[Resolve]] against instill actions. a successful roll unleashes a burst of sparks that cause the enemy to lose ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]], which the wielder doesn’t gain.
