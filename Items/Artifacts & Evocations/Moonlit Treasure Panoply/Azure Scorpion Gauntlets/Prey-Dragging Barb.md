*As the gauntletâ€™s blades strike true, the wielder retracts their chains, pulling her foe back with them.*
An enemy damaged by a decisive [[Thrown]] attack is pulled one range band toward the wielder and falls prone. If the attack deals 4+ damage, the wielder can pull the enemy two range bands.
## Resonant
With [[Essence]] 3, the wielder only needs to deal 2+ damage to pull an enemy two range bands.
