So captivating is the Sidereal’s performance that her audience pays no heed to its performer, letting her step out unnoticed. The Sidereal stops performing, but the performance continues. The lingering vibrations of her performance’s fate cause audience members to believe that someone is continuing to perform. The Sidereal can’t make influence rolls through the lingering performance. The audience pays no heed to the apparent performer and forgets the Sidereal's involvement in the performance, as with arcane fate (p. XX). The Sidereal can enter concealment within the audience without needing a hiding place and can use the Performance Excellency to enhance Larceny and Stealth rolls against them. Trivial characters can’t notice her at all. If the Sidereal uses this Charm while performing with magic like Fivefold Maiden Melody, she ignores those effect's restrictions on her actions, but must pay five motes or Initiative at the start of each of subsequent turn in combat or minute outside to maintain it.
