*Channeling sorcerous power through the Quincunx’s crystals, the wearer perfectly calculates the trajectory of an attack and sends whips of [[Essence]] lashing to intercept the strike.*
She reflexively rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) to clash an attack against her. On a success, she doesn’t deal damage; instead, the Quincunx banks sorcerous motes equal to her total successes. This doesn’t count as the wearer’s combat action for the turn. 

## Resonant

Winning the clash also strips ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] from the attacker, which is added to the wearer’s [[Initiative]].
