Closing her eyes to the world, the Dragon-Blood casts her senses out onto the winds. Upon using this Charm, she specifies either a specific individual whose voice she wishes to listen for, or a specific sound to search for such as a particular phrase being spoken by any individual, a wagon’s wheels moving across a road, or a sword being drawn. She enters a trance in which she can hear the specified sound from (Essence) miles away, or (Essence x5) miles if it’s extremely loud, such as a tyrant lizard’s roar or an army on the march. If the specified sound occurs, she rolls to detect it with double 7s. Even on a failed roll, she’s able to hear the sound; success pinpoints its exact location. The Charm ends after she rolls.
