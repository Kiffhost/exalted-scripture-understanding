*Focusing on a cherished keepsake or important piece of evidence, the Sidereal attunes herself to its secret heart, hearing what it would say if it could speak.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm on an object that’s relevant to one of her Intimacies, making a difficulty 1 (Perception + Investigation) roll with (Intimacy) bonus dice. One success attunes her to that object’s Essence and fate, letting her hear and interact with it as though dealing with a person.
The Storyteller plays the object like any other Storyteller character, but it isn’t real and can’t directly affect anyone but the Sidereal. The Storyteller can assign it whatever traits he chooses; the default is five dice for all social and mental pools and no ability to take physical action at all. It has a positive Defining Tie toward the Sidereal chosen by the Storyteller.
If the Sidereal rolls any extra successes, she banks that many intuition points and can spend them on the following effects while interacting with the object:
4 points: The object points out something the Sidereal missed, letting her reroll an Awareness, Investigation, or Lore roll.
4 points: The object makes an influence roll to overturn influence affecting the Sidereal (Exalted, p. 221), with a pool of (Sidereal’s Essence + 10) dice.
4 points: The object accurately describes the last person to handle it. The Sidereal can subsequently use this option again for a description of the possessor before the last one, and so on.
7 points: The object accurately describes an event chosen by the Sidereal that it was present for and will include at least some useful information if any exists.
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Tie in the course of an investigation. Oracles can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
