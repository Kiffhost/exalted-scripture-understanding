This slow, subtle rhythm wakes the lower soul while the conscious mind still sleeps. The Exalt makes a persuade roll against a sleeping human as if he had a Major Tie of obedience toward her. If successful, the sleeper’s lower soul takes command of his body and sleepwalks to the Exalt, who can then make a single spoken persuade action. Because the lower soul is the seat of passion without reason, any of the sleeper’s Intimacies with no emotional content are suppressed for purposes of this influence. The sleeper must fulfill the task before waking if possible. Taking damage or entering life-threatening danger wakes the sleeper. He remembers nothing of what he did under the influence of this Evocation.
