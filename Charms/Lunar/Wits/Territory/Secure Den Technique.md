*Hidden in cunningly dug boltholes or well-stocked safehouses, the Lunar vanishes from the world.*
She spends a day working to secure an enclosed space that can hold up to ([[Essence]] + [[Wits]]) people, rolling ([[Wits]] + {Craft, [[Larceny]], or Survival}). This den is impossible for casual observers to notice; only characters actively seeking it can attempt to find it, opposing the Lunar’s roll with a ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Survival}) roll. Attempts to track characters into the den or otherwise indirectly infer its location suffer a (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) penalty. The Lunar and those she reveals her lair to can perceive it unhindered. If the Lunar has a relevant [[Craft]], she gains craft points from creating the den as though she’d completed a basic project. A Lunar with [[Magpie’s Nest Resourcefulness]] (p. XX) can activate it reflexively with this Charm to reveal that she’s previously prepared a den, though this imposes a −2 penalty on her roll. This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if the Lunar uses it in a territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]].
