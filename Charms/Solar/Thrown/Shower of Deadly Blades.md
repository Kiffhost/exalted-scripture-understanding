*The Lawgiver hurls a barrage of throwing weapons, centered around a single target, but striking every enemy within short range of that target.*
This is rolled as a single withering attack against all targets, but damage is only rolled against the initial target. Damage to all other targets is determined by this roll: foes struck by the attack automatically lose an amount of [[Initiative]] equal to the initial target, but not exceeding the Solarâ€™s [[Essence]]. This extra [[Initiative]] is not rewarded to the Solar upon success; she only gains [[Initiative]] from her initial target. This attack is generally used to scatter groups of enemies, and tends to leave dozens of throwing weapons embedded into the scenery. Using [[Shower of Deadly Blades]] forces an ammunition check (see p. 202) which cannot be enhanced by a Charm, and if she fails the Solar may not use this Charm again until she has taken at least three turns scavenging weaponry, as described on page 202.
