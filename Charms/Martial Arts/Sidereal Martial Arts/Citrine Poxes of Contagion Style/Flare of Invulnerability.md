The martial artist stirs her Essence into a furious conflagration of life and energy. The stylist gains Hardness (Essence + Stamina + Medicine) and may use it in place of her soak if it’s higher. When determining if her Hardness prevents damage decisive damage, her attacker uses only his Initiative, not damage dice from other sources. Against magical attacks that don’t include an attacker’s Initiative, he uses the lower of his Initiative or the attack’s base damage. This Charm ends if the stylist is crashed or goes a round without spending at least ten motes. In Citrine Poxes of Contagion Form, she need only spend five motes per round. Reset: Once per scene.
