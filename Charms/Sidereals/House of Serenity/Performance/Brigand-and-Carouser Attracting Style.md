*Strumming the threads of fate like a drunken lutist, the Sidereal brings herself into harmony with those on society’s margins.*
After a few hours or days spent merrymaking, going to parties, or flirting with strangers, the Sidereal’s assured to find herself caught up with a coterie of outcasts, ne’er-do-wells, and misfits. The Storyteller chooses the group, but the Sidereal may specify a general description: criminals, bohemian artists, political dissidents, etc. Alternatively, she may empower an existing such a coterie she’s fallen in with. As long as the Sidereal remains involved with her coterie and spends significant time interacting with them over downtimes, she gains the following benefits: 
- Her coterie and other characters within their social milieu accept her as one of their own. This counts as a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]]. 
- At the start of a scene, she may declare that a coterie member with skills equivalent to a mortal two-dot Retainer is with her, either having just arrived or been with her all along. She can’t choose a new Retainer until he leaves, there’s a downtime, or the session ends. 
- She can [[Introducing a Fact|introduce facts]] relevant to her coterie’s social milieu or about local rumors with ([[Wits]] + [[Performance]]). 
- She waives Excellencies’ mote costs to reduce the target number of [[Craft]], [[Larceny]], or [[Performance]] rolls similar to those involved in her coterie’s activities.
