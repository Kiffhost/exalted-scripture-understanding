*The Dragon-Blood can tell outsiders from locals with a glance, picking up on the subtle cues woven into the living web of society.*
While she’s in a city, village, or similar settlement, she can determine whether a character she perceives lives in that location, no matter how humble the place he calls home. Outside of a settlement, she instead discerns if a character is a resident of the largest nearby settlement she’s aware of. Fair Folk always appear as strangers, no matter how integrated into society they may be, but this doesn’t reveal their true nature. If the Dragon-Blood uses this Charm against a character in disguise or employing a similar magical deception, and learning his residence would compromise his ruse, she must roll ([[Perception]] + [[Investigation]]) with double 9s against his [[Guile]]. On a failed roll, the Dragon-Blood receives a result that conforms with her target’s cover. If the Dragon-Blood has memorized a character’s scent with [[Bloodhound’s Nose Technique]], she can use this Charm to see if he calls a place home without needing him to be present.
