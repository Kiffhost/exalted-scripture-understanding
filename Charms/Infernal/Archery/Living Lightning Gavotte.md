*The Infernal's arrow becomes a bolt of dancing lightning, arcing from foe to foe in exuberant revelry.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have Initiative 12+. She makes a decisive attack that can strike multiple foes. She chooses an initial target, then another enemy within short range of him. She can continue choosing additional targets, each within short range of the last, up to a maximum of (Dexterity) targets. She can't target the same enemy twice. The bolt can extend out beyond her weapon's range, and can target characters at medium range or beyond without needing to aim.

The Infernal makes a single attack roll, but rolls damage separately against each enemy, beginning with the initial target. If she deals any damage, the bolt then leaps to the next target, and continues in the same way until it has struck all targets or the Infernal fails to deal damage. This doesn't reset her Initiative - instead, after each attack, she loses Initiative equal to her successes on the damage roll. This can't reduce her below (higher of Essence or 3) Initiative.
