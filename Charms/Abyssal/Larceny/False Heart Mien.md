*A master of disguise, the Abyssal moves unnoticed among the living.*
The Abyssal adds two successes and doubles 9s on a disguise roll, and ignores penalties for disguising herself as someone of a different race or gender. Additionally, her disguise can include increasing or reducing her height by 10 inches, increasing or decreasing her weight by up to 10%, changing her apparent age, and altering her voice or accent.
Rolls opposing the Abyssal’s disguise fail automatically unless enhanced by magic, and even magically enhanced attempts suffer a −2 success penalty. Even a successful roll opposing the disguise doesn’t reveal the Abyssal’s identity or appearance, only that she is not who she appears to be.
