The Sidereal need only see someone from an across the room to win his heart. The Sidereal makes an influence roll with any Ability through body language to seduce someone or instill a Tie of romantic or sexual desire toward herself, ignoring the Resolve bonus for using body language (Exalted, p. 221). Other characters won’t recognize that she attempted to influence her target unless they successfully read her intentions or profile her that scene. With a Socialize 4 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a one-mote, one-Willpower surcharge for greater subtlety, adding (Essence) Guile against rolls that would reveal her attempt. Rolls that aren’t enhanced by magic or are made by characters with Ties of romantic or sexual desire toward her won’t realize this even if successful.
