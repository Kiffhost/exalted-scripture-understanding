The Dragon-Blood’s understanding of the cycle of elements and the flow of [[Essence]] allows her to empower her fellow Terrestrial Exalted. She transfers her Elemental Aura to a touched Dragon-Blood who isn’t in Aura state, and up to ([[Essence]] x3) of her own motes to her choice of his personal or peripheral pool. This Charm has the same aspect as the transferred Aura, and granted motes can only be spent on [[Charms]] of that element, Balanced [[Charms]], or magic without an elemental aspect. If the target’s mote pool can’t accept all the motes transferred, he has until his next action to spend them before they dissipate. A [[Lore]] 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase of this Charm allows the Dragon-Blood to also transfer a single level of anima when she uses this Charm.
