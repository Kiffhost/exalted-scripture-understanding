*The Infernal flays away the burdens of her heart, scouring true love and vengeful bitterness alike.*

The Infernal erases one of her Ties to an individual, turning her back on him and walking away. If he isn’t present in the scene, she need only mouth his name silently. Forsaking a Major or Defining Tie grants her one Willpower. She can’t forsake Ties to her Lunar mate.

For the rest of the story, the Infernal can’t voluntarily reform or strengthen the forsaken Intimacy. Rolls to instil it use the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221).

The Infernal may optionally erase the forsaken character from her memories. She retains her memory of past events involving him, but misremembers or misattributes events and deeds specific to him.
## Reset
Once per day, unless reset by voluntarily raising a Tie to an individual to Major or Defining intensity.
## [[Keys]]
#### Easily Abandoned Burden (Integrity 4)
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when a character makes an influence roll, sacrificing a Tie to an individual that would have supported the influence. Sacrificing an Intimacy used to justify an instil roll, persuade roll, or similar influence doesn’t render that influence unacceptable.
#### Outrunning the Past (Essence 2, Easily Abandoned Burden) (+3m)
If the Infernal chooses to erase her memories of a Major or Defining Tie, she reduces the Willpower cost to resist the influence by one. She may pay a three-mote surcharge when facing an influence roll that requires the sacrificed Tie to justify it, like a persuade roll . If she does, that influence fails automatically unless the Infernal has another Intimacy that supports it.
