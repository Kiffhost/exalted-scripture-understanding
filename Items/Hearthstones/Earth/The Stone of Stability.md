*This stone causes all structure within three miles to become unusually sturdy and stable.*
In addition to surviving all but the worst earthquakes without harm, bridges are able to bear more weight than normal and mineshafts are unlikely to collapse even if poorly reinforced and shored up. This stone does not allow entirely unstable structures to stand, or a flimsy bridge to support a caravan of yeddim. Instead, it roughly doubles structuresâ€™ strength and durability. This stone only affects structures like houses, mineshafts and bridges that are built on or into the ground and cannot be moved without great effort.
Also, this stone provides no protection against deliberate physical attacks on what it reinforces.
