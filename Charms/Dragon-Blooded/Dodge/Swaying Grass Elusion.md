The Dragon-Blood bends and sways under an enemyâ€™s attack, letting the force of his strike blow past her like the wind. She may raise her Evasion for two Initiative per point, and adds two to the maximum amount she may raise her Evasion with Charm bonuses (p. 162). Upon successfully dodging an attack made by a nontrivial enemy with lower Initiative, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Wood Aura to regain half the Initiative spent on this Charm, rounded up.
