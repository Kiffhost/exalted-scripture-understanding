*Everlasting Descent twists the trajectory of everything from arrows to meteors, sending them off-course in arcing parabolas.*
The wielder clashes a ranged attack with (Intelligence + Martial Arts), adding (Spin) bonus dice. Success lets her redirect the projectile, making an attack as with Errant Star Diversion. All magic used on the clashed attack applies its benefits to the wielder’s attack, if applicable. Alternatively, this Evocation can be used to defend the wielder against uncountable damage, rolling (Intelligence + Martial Arts) at difficulty 5. Success negates all damage, and renders the wielder immune to recurring sources of damage. Such force can’t be redirected at an enemy; it arcs away uncontrollaby but harmlessly. Once per story, the wielder can use this to protect everyone affected by a source of uncountable damage, not just herself, with a difficulty 7 roll. While Whirling Ecliptic Barrier is active, its cover bonus is added as automatic successes on both the (Intelligence + Occult) roll and the wielder’s attack roll. 
## Dissonant
Making an attack after a successful clash counts as the wielder’s attack for the round.
