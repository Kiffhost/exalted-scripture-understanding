	<summary>Why?</summary>
 Your choice of <b>Caste</b> and <b>Favored Abilities</b> is important to your character’s future development—it’s less expensive to improve selected Abilities, and to learn Charms associated with them. Charms belonging to your <b><i>Apocalyptic Ability</b></i> treat your Essence rating as 5 for the purpose of prerequisites.
