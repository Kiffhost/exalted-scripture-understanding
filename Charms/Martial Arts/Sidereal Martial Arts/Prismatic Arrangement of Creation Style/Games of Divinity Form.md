Moving with infinitely baroque complexity, the martial artist comes as close to perfect beauty as any imperfect being can. The stylist gains the following benefits: 
-  Her Appearance adds bonus dice (Exalted, p. 218) on all opposed physical rolls against enemies who can perceive her. 
-  She gains +1 Evasion against characters with Resolve lower than her Appearance (including bonus dots). 
-  Enemies can’t attack her or take harmful actions against her unless they spend one Willpower to resist for the scene. Characters whose Resolve is lower than her Appearance or who have positive Ties toward her must pay two Willpower instead. 
-  Any character — friend or foe — who witnesses the martial artist in this Form must succeed on a (Wits + Integrity) roll at a difficulty of the stylist’s Appearance (including bonus dots) or become addicted to viewing this Form, with −3 withdrawal penalty (Exalted, p. 167). Other depictions of the Games of Divinity, like dreamstones, can substitute for the Form. Enlightenment: Characters addicted to this Form count as having a Major Tie of Obsession toward the stylist. 

## Special activation rules

The stylist can reflexively enter this Form when she succeeds on an Appearance-based influence roll or a dance-based Performance roll in with 5+ successes.
