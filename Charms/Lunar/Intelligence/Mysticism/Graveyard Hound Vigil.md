*The Lunar stands between the worlds of the living and the dead, a sentinel against revenants risen from shattered tombs and the Underworld’s abhuman horrors.*
Her Lunar [[Charms]] that specifically affect spirits and fae also apply to nonspiritual undead like zombies, but not undead Exalted. Once per story, when the Lunar upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] by helping a ghost complete unfinished business, slaying an Underworld monster, negotiating between the living and the dead, sealing a shadowland, or performing a similar task, she gains two [[Willpower]] and loses one [[Limit]].
