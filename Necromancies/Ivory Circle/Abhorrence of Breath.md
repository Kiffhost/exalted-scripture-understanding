*With a keen and shattering screech, the necromancer cracks the shell of the world to create a void which draws in air, sound, and hope.*
A pin-sized void opens at a point within [[Range|medium range]] of the necromancer. It begins to draw in all air and loose matter within [[Range|long range]]. At the start of each character’s turn, they must make a reflexive ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) roll against (higher of necromancer’s [[Essence]] or 3) to avoid begin dragged one [[Range|range band]] towards it.
A vacuum forms within [[Range|short range]] of the void, silencing all mundane sound and causing characters to suffocate (Exalted, p. 232). The necromancer is immune to the void’s pull, but is still silenced and breathless. The void is too small for most things to pass through, but liquid — especially shed blood — is greedily drawn in.
## Control
The necromancer moves with unearthly quiet, inflicting a −2 penalty to detect her by hearing.
Spirits of air and sky — and the ghosts of all who died by suffocation or drowning — gain an automatic Minor Tie of enmity for her upon meeting her for the first time.
## Distortion (10)
The necromancer is no longer immune to her own hazard. Other characters reduce the difficulty to resist being drawn in by one, except for the necromancer herself — whatever exists beyond the void, it delights in treachery.
