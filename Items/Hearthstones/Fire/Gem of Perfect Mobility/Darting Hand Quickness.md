Like a flame, the Exalt is in constant motion. She may reflexively take any Dexterity action other than an attack, regardless of Initiative order. This Evocation may only be used once per scene, unless reset by succeeding on an opposed Dexterity roll against a non-trivial enemy with 5+ total successes.
