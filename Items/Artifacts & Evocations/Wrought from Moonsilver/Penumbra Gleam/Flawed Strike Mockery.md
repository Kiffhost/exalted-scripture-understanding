Enemies who witness their failed techniques reflected in Penumbra Gleam falter. Successfully blocking an attack steals one point of Initiative from the attacker and grants one Reflection. 

## Resonant

With Essence 3, the wielder may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to steal Initiative equal to the difference between the failed attack and her Parry, maximum (Perception).
