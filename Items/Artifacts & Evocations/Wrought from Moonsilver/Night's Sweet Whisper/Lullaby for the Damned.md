Allia’s soul is reborn in the piper’s song, calling out to the living nightmares and soul-drinking princes of the Wyld and offering them peace. The piper rolls a special gambit with ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) against the [[Resolve]] of a fae within long range. This attack roll can benefit from magic that enhances inspire rolls. The gambit’s difficulty is (fae’s higher of [[Essence]] or [[Willpower]]). Success transforms it into a harmless shape — a small animal, tree, mortal child, etc. — for a year and a day. It retains its intellect, [[Essence]], and [[Charms]], but its memories of the time before the transformation become hazy and dreamlike. It forms a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of belief that it has always been whatever it was transformed into, and a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of nonviolence. Any [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] incompatible with these are suppressed for the transformation’s duration. Some fae may remain transformed permanently, at the Storyteller’s discretion — usually weak fae, or those who prefer their new existence. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by succeeding on an influence roll against a nontrivial fae that’s opposed by a Defining [[Intimacy]] or instilling a nontrivial fae with a Defining [[Intimacy]]. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power can’t reset it.
