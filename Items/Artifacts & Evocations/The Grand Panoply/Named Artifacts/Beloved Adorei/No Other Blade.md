*The second Evocation of Adorei allows the Solar’s attacks to hone in on a target he’s struck with the prerequisite, granting one automatic non-Charm success if the attack roll has at least one 10 in it.*
However, after using this Charm, the Solar takes a -1 penalty to use any other weapon for the rest of the scene. 

*Quoth the [[Templates/daiklave]]:* “What’s [[Spring Razor]] got on me?!”
