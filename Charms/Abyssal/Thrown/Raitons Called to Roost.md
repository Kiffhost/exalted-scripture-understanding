*Fallen weapons seek out the deathknight’s hand, recognizing her as the superior killer.*
When the Abyssal succeeds on a disarm gambit against an enemy within short range, she summons the disarmed weapon to her hand. If she doesn’t have a free hand, it falls at her feet.
With [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal may pay a two-[[Initiative]] surcharge to use this Charm after a disarm gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll.
