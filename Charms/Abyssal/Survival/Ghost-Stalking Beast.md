*The deathknight’s hunting hounds bay for the souls of the damned.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Spirit-Sensing Meditation]] (p. XX), she can extend its benefits to any familiars present in the scene for one mote each.
If the Abyssal knows [[Corpus-Rending Blow]] or [[God-Slaying Torment]], she may use them to enhance her familiar’s attacks.
