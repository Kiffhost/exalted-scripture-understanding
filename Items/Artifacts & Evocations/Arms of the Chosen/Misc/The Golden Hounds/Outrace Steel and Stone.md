*Focusing on her speed, the Exalt becomes an avatar of haste.*
She gains the following abilities: 
- At Celerity 2+, she may place movement actions in a [[flurry]] without taking the usual penalties. 
- At Celerity 3+, using a drag action against a grappled foe only uses up one round of control. 
- She can spend 1i to add (Celerity) to her [[Defense|Evasion]] against one attack. 

## Resonant

The Exalt adds (Celerity) to [[Defense|Evasion]] at all times without needing to spend [[Initiative]].
