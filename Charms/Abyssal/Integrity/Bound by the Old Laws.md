*Having damned herself with one promise, it is not lightly that the Abyssal makes her vows.*
When the Abyssal formally commits to an agreement, she may instantly form a Minor [[Intimacy|Principle]] expressing her grim resignation to upholding her part of the deal. (This counts as a negative Principle). If she genuinely intends to honor the bargain, her sincerity becomes self-evident to any other parties to the agreement. If she doesn’t, she adds ([[Integrity]]/2) dice on [[Manipulation]]-based [[influence]] rolls against them for the rest of the scene.
Upon fulfilling an agreement, the Abyssal discards this Principle, if she still has it, and gains one [[Willpower]]. She can’t gain more than one [[Willpower]] per day this way.
