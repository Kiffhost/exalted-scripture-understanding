*Weeping for the ignorance of youths and immortals, the bleak saint reveals the salvation that awaits them.*
The stylist forces an enemy to confront his inevitable end with a decisive attack, adding (Essence, maximum 5) dice of damage. If the attack’s damage equals or exceeds the target’s Resolve, the stylist inflicts a Psyche effect. Nothing can modify his base Resolve against this except Intimacies that reflect his view of death: positive attitudes increase it, while negative perspectives penalize it.
If successful, the victim gains a Minor Obsession (Exalted, p. 169) with his own mortality. The Obsession’s intensity increases to Major for the Exalted and those with similar supernatural longevity and Defining for spirits and other immortals, but they can weaken it to a minimum of Minor by paying one Willpower per level of intensity. They must do so at the time this Charm is used.
For the rest of the scene, the victim must pay (Obsession) Initiative to take any non-reflexive action that doesn’t take him out of harm’s way or help protect him against harm. Even then, he suffers a −(Obsession) penalty on the roll.
Resisting this requires a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]]. The victim must cite an Intimacy of equal or greater intensity than his Obsession, explaining how it supports accepting his mortality, and pay one Willpower. The Exalted and others with similar longevity must pay two Willpower, while spirits and other immortals must pay three. This frees him from the above effects and renders him immune to further uses for the rest of the scene, but doesn’t remove the Obsession.
## Enlightenment
The stylist may activate this Charm reflexively after rolling damage for a decisive attack, forgoing the bonus damage but rolling (Essence, maximum 5) dice to add successes to the Psyche effect.
