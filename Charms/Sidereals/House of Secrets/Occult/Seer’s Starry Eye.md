*The Sidereal has an intuitive understanding of astrological divinations, fortune-telling, and similar folk magics.*
She gains the [[Thaumaturgist]] Merit and the two-dot Astrological Horoscope ritual or a similar fortune-telling or divinatory ritual. She may subsequently learn up to four dots worth of thaumaturgical rituals of any kind for no experience point cost, although she must have access to a tutor. This Charm can be repurchased up to (Essence/2, rounded up) times, letting the Sidereal learn five additional dots of rituals for each purchase. Thaumaturgical Divination The Astrological Horoscope ritual is identical to [[Reading the Tea Leaves]] (Exalted, p. 490), except that it involves consulting the positions of the stars rather than tea leaves. The ritual’s one-dot version lets a thaumaturgist predict the course a subject’s life will take with a difficulty 2 ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) roll or the most life-changing event that will happen in the next day with a difficulty 4 roll. The two-dot version also lets her divine a subject’s best chances for success or failure in the coming months with a difficulty 3 roll. Numerous other divinatory rituals exist in Creation — haruspicy, reading cards, casting oracle bones, and more. While players and Storytellers are free to devise bespoke mechanics for such rituals, Reading the Tea Leaves’ mechanics can be used as the default for such rituals. While [[Reading the Tea Leaves]] refers to a character’s “destiny,” this is figurative, not the destiny planned by Heaven. Divinatory rituals offer glimpses into the future through mystic rituals, not fate or destiny.
