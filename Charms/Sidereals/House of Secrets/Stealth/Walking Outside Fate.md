The Sidereal steps outside the weave of fate to walk unnoticed. Rolls opposing the Sidereal’s Stealth or to track her suffer +1 target number. Characters without superhuman senses or applicable magic can’t perceive her directly while she’s in concealment even if they beat her Stealth roll. Success only reveals that there’s a presence nearby, providing enough forewarning that the Sidereal’s attack won’t be unexpected. She’s considered an enemy of fate. This Charm ends if the Sidereal takes an overt action, including Joining Battle or blatantly displaying supernatural power, or if her anima reaches burning or higher.
