*The Infernal is fuelled by the acclaim of her audience, rewarding faithful subjects with beauty beyond imagining.*

When the Infernal succeeds on a Performance roll, she’s refunded motes equal to the effective Size of her audience, as if it were a battle group (Exalted, p. 206). If the majority of audience members have or gain a positive Tie toward her, she’s refunded (Intimacy/2, rounded up) additional motes.
## [[Keys]]
#### Magnificent Demon-King Dance (Performance 5)
Once per day, the Infernal can also refund one Willpower spent on the roll. She can reset this by succeeding on a Performance roll against a Size 3+ audience.
