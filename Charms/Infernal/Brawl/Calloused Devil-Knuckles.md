*The Infernal needs only her bare hands to bring low gods and tyrants.*

The Infernal can deal lethal damage with unarmed attacks and can block attacks that deal lethal damage barehanded.

The Infernal can pay one mote when she attacks to reroll 6s on the damage roll until they cease to appear. (This includes attacks with weapons.) If she rerolls three or more 6s, she rolls an additional die of damage.
