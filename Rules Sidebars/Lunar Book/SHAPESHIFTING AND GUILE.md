Characters can notice a Lunar acting out of character with read intentions and profile character actions even if they can’t see through her disguise. Characters who uncover contradictory information won’t necessarily assume she’s a shapeshifting impostor — they might think she’s suffering profound trauma, keeping a secret, or afflicted by a curse or madness, or they might offer some other explanation for her behavior.
