*Silvery roots branch outward from the Infernal's arrow, then branch outward again and again, forming a lattice of living metal.*

The Infernal shoots a projectile at a point within her weapon's range, causing metallic vegetation to rapidly grow out to short range, becoming difficult terrain. Each time a character moves between range bands within it, he suffers an environmental hazard with difficulty 3, Damage 1L/round from razor-sharp foliage. The Infernal isn't impeded by this terrain and doesn't suffer the hazard.

The metallic foliage can provide light cover, and the Infernal can roll to take cover within it reflexively on her turn. (This still uses her movement action.) Enemies never receive the benefit of this cover against the Infernal's attacks.

The mirrored foliage reflects enemies' innermost truths. As long as they're within the overgrowth, they suffer -2 Guile.
## [[Keys]] 
#### Hell-Gardener's Mercy
The Infernal's allies aren't impeded by the foliage's difficult terrain or hazard, and their attacks ignore its cover.
#### Thousand Razor Forest
The hazard's traits increases to difficulty 5, Damage 3L/round.
#### Ever-Branching Expansion (Essence 3) (+5m)
The Infernal can pay a five-mote surcharge to extend the overgrowth to medium range.
