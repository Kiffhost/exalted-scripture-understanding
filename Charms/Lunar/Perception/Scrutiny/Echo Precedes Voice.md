The Lunar knows others better than they know themselves, anticipating their words before they think to speak.
The Lunar reflexively makes a special (Perception + [Awareness, Investigation, or Socialize]) read intentions roll against someone within short range. If successful, she anticipates that he’s about to say something. His player tells the Lunar’s player what he is about to say; the Lunar may mockingly predict his next words aloud, preempt him with a witticism of her own, or offer some similar derision. This catches that character off-guard, imposing a penalty of (1 + extra successes, maximum [Lunar’s Perception]) on his next action. In combat, he also loses (Lunar’s Essence) Initiative, which the Lunar gains. If it’s vital that he remain silent, he may pay one Willpower to do so, but still suffers this Charm’s other detrimental effects.
When a character within short range makes an influence roll, the Lunar may use this Charm reflexively to anticipate it. If successful, this Charm’s penalty is imposed on the influence roll.

## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by succeeding on an opposed roll against a nontrivial character whose intentions the Lunar has read previously in the scene, or a roll against the Resolve or Defense of such a character.
