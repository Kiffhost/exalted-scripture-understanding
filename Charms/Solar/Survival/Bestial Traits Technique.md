*With this Charm, the Solar can invest her [[Spirit-Tied Pet]] with traits beyond its natural capacity.*
This Charm supplements a normal beast-training roll, rerolling all 1s until 1s fail to appear. In addition to teaching her charge a new command, she can also increase one of the following traits upon the successful completion of the extended roll. 
- [[Strength]], [[Dexterity]], [[Stamina]], or [[Perception]] +1. This may not be repurchased for the same Attribute more than once, and may not give a familiar an Attribute rated higher than 10. 
- [[Athletics]], [[Brawl]], [[Larceny]], [[Martial Arts]], [[Performance]], [[Resistance]], [[Stealth]], or [[Survival]], by one dot, to a maximum of the Exalt’s rating in that Ability. 
- Steeliness (Merit): This special merit permanently raises the familiar’s [[Resolve]] against intimidation or other fear inducing effects by 1. This may only be purchased once.
