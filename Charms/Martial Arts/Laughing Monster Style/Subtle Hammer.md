*The stylist makes a showy, exaggerated feint, only to swiftly reverse into an unexpected death blow.*
After a successful distract or disarm gambit, she can use this Charm to reflexively make a decisive attack against her target, with damage equal to her extra successes on the gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t include or reset her [[Initiative]]. If this incapacitates him, the gambit’s [[Initiative]] cost is refunded. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully clashing a nontrivial enemy’s attack with [[Inauspicious Moment for Attack]]. 
## Mastery
Laughing Monster Form’s bonus dice are added to attacks made with this Charm.
