*The Abyssal’s wild dance stirs her audience to a frenzy, for they all might die before dawn.*
The Abyssal makes an (Appearance + Performance) inspire roll over the course of a few minutes, adding (Essence) bonus dice. Affected characters suffer a −3 penalty on Perception rolls and Join Battle rolls and treat any Intimacies related to discipline, fear, or self-restraint as one step weaker for the rest of the scene.
With Performance 5, Essence 3, if the Abyssal uses this Charm on characters engaged in a social event, like a gala, festival, or wedding, she may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to have the inspired emotions last for the duration of that event, rather than just one scene. She can only do so once per event.
