This extraordinarily valuable yellow gemstone can trap minor spirits and newly made ghosts. To imprison a spirit, the user must touch the spirit and spend a point of Willpower, then make a contested Willpower roll against the spirit; success imprisons the spirit in the crystal. The spirit cannot typically have an Essence greater than 2. Each stone can hold only a single spirit at a time, and anyone holding the stone can free the spirit at will.

Once imprisoned in yasal crystal, spirits can communicate with anyone who touches the stone, but they cannot escape on their own or use any of their Charms. Instead, whoever touches the stone can use a captive spirit’s powers as if they were his own, if the holder of the stone has the spirit’s permission. To obtain this permission, the holder must usually bargain with the spirit, typically requesting the free use of its powers for a set number of times. After exhausting all the uses, or after a set time period (rarely more than a month), the holder agrees to free the spirit. While the holder is under no obligation to keep this promise, those who break it end up with uncooperative spirits inside useless rocks. Also, spirits who break free from such an oathbreaker will undoubtedly attempt to take dire vengeance on him and might have the help of friends and allies.

On rare occasions, yasal crystals of exceptional purity may be found in powerful demesnes, particularly in the South. These crystals are capable of capturing more powerful spirits, and carry higher Artifact ratings accordingly. Yasal crystals do not need to be attuned.
