The Lunar swells with overbearing pride. Everyone she perceives must be made to acknowledge her authority or superiority. Those who don’t, or who fail to make their understanding of their own inferiority sufficiently explicit, must be convinced otherwise. This can take many forms — verbally berating someone, challenging him to a duel or competition, flaunting power or wealth, loudly proclaiming oneself a Lunar — so long as they cause others to submit.
This ends if the Lunar suffers a significant defeat or setback as a result of trying to prove her superiority.
