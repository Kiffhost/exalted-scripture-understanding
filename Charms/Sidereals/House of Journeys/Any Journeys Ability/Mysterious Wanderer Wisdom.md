*The Sidereal is an enigmatic figure roaming Creation, offering her wisdom to those who join her on the road.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits
- Anyone journeying with her or evaluating potential guides, crew, passengers, or other companions assumes she has knowledge useful to the journey. This counts as a Minor Tie.
- Once per day, she may grant someone following her advice −1 target number on a Ride, Sail, or Survival roll.
- Rolls to uncover how she came to be aboard a ship, with a group of travelers, etc. suffer +1 target number. Trivial characters automatically fail such rolls.
- When she and her traveling companions sleep, she senses if any of them suffer from baleful magic. She doesn’t learn the victim’s identity but adds (Essence) dice on rolls to follow up on this.
Discovering and curing the affliction counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
