The Solar permanently gains ([[Essence]]) successes to treat forms of disease, even if she does not have the proper tools or medicine to do so. Her efforts still must be efficacious and logical, but even if she lacks the most ideal instruments, she can still attempt to cure a plague or other sickness. Once a patient has been treated by the Solar, if he recovers, he gains four automatic non-Charm successes to resist disease virulence for the rest of the season.
