Centering herself in mind, body, and Essence, the vizier strikes through magic that would cloud her vision or twist her mind to punish those responsible. The stylist clashes a Psyche effect with a decisive attack, rolling Join Battle to determine her Initiative if she uses this Charm outside of combat. If the Psyche effect is normally unrolled, the character using it makes an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll. Winning this clash negates that Psyche effect; if the character using it is within range of the stylist’s attacks, she rolls decisive damage against him normally. She can also do so if he’s within range of a shadow finger’s weapon, making her attack through her disciple. 
## Mastery

The stylist may pay a five-mote surcharge to clash a Psyche effect against a shadow finger within long range.
