The Solar dwells in a temple of words. With this Charm, she may affect a textual absorption so complete that her Guile becomes perfect and unbreakable. So long as she is reading, she cannot be read. This effect lasts for moments after she has finished reading, allowing the Exalt to completely hide her reaction to what she just read. Using this Charm with Perfect Recollection Discipline allows the Solar to phase out completely, evading prying questions and other attempts to gauge her. In this instance, her defense is no longer perfect, and her Guile may be engaged. However, without magic to pierce her deception, characters will only notice that she is extremely preoccupied or distracted.
