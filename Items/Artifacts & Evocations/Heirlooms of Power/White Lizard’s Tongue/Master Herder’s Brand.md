*Where [[White Lizard’s Tongue]] strikes its wielder’s foes or cattle, it marks them with a chalky white brand, Old Realm glyphs spelling out the wielder’s name.*
Branding an enemy requires a difficulty 2 gambit; branding willing characters or unwitting cattle outside of combat requires no roll. Branded characters suffer −1 [[Resolve]] against the wielder. Additionally, the wielder can reflexively cause a character’s brand to weigh him down under the spiritual pressure of Earth [[Essence]], imposing a −1 mobility penalty until she ends it as a reflexive action or he moves to further than long range from her.
Normally, a brand can’t be removed while this Evocation remains active. If a branded character crashes or incapacitates the wielder, his brand vanishes.
A single use of this Evocation can brand a number of willing or unwitting animals equivalent to a [[Size]] (wielder’s [[Essence]]) battle group. This requires no roll. Such uses can’t affect familiars and other magical animals.

## Special activation rules
A Dragon-Blooded Sesus scion awakens this Evocation at no cost upon attuning to [[White Lizard’s Tongue]].
## Resonant
The wielder can inflict one level of decisive damage per 10 on the [[Initiative]] roll, paying one [[Initiative]] per level inflicted in addition to the gambit’s [[Initiative]] cost.
