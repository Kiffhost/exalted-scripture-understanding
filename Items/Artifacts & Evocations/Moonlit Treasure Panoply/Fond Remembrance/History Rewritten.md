Striking at the past itself, False Remembrance’s master carves out her place in history.
## Resonant
Only characters who are resonant with Fond Remembrance can awaken this Evocation.
The wielder makes a false memory gambit against any number of characters within (Essence) range bands.
For mortals, this extends to (Essence x5) miles. She can choose to exempt characters from the effect. The gambit’s difficulty is the highest Resolve among all targets that are present in the scene.
Rather than changing each target’s memories individually, the wielder alters their memories to indicate that she took some action in that region’s past: rescuing a lost child, fending off a raiding warband, murdering a prince. Their memories are adjusted to reflect the occurrence and consequences of this event, as per All Your Yesterdays. The wielder can alter significantly more than a single scene of memory, affecting spans of memory comparable in length to a story instead.
The wielder can use this Evocation outside of combat, but can only affect mortals when she does so. Instead of making a gambit, she rolls (Manipulation + Melee) against the Resolve of all targets.

## Reset 
Once per story.
