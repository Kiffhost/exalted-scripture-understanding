The Lunar’s prey can never escape her, even if they flee to the ends of the earth. For every 10 on a tracking roll, she rolls an additional non-Charm die and rerolls a 1. She can track even characters using Traceless Passage (Exalted, p. 412) or similar magic. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Keen Nose, the Lunar also adds non-Charm dice equal to her quarry’s wound penalty at the time he left the tracks.
