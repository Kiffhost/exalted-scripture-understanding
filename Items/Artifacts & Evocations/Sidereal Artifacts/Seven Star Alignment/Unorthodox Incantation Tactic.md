*Pavonis’ cunning lives on in [[Seven Star Alignment]], inspiring unorthodox uses of martial [[sorcery]].*
The wielder adds ([[Occult]]) dice on a gambit’s attack roll and can spend sorcerous motes as though they were [[Initiative]] on the gambit’s cost. This Evocation can also enhance a decisive attack made with a spell, letting the wielder disarm her foes as well as damaging them, with the above benefits. No separate [[Initiative]] roll is needed for the gambit, but the wielder must pay the disarm gambit’s cost before determining the attack’s damage. If the attack has multiple targets, she must pay the gambit’s cost separately for each of them.
