*After the fae Prince Balor’s dread gaze shattered the fabled [[lance]] Eternal Talon, Okopa the God-Slaver gathered as many of its fragments as she could.*
While she didn’t salvage enough to reforge Eternal Talon, she used what she had to create the twin Ichneumon Blades. To her disgust and horror, the weaons she created had nothing of Eternal Talon’s nobility or wisdom, having drunk so deeply of Balor’s death-gaze that it poisoned their very [[Essence]]. [[The Ichneumon Blades]] know only ice-cold sadism, a hunger for pain no master has ever been able to slake. Each Ichenumon Blade is a long, thin spike of moonsilver, with jagged edges fit to maim. They’re attached to bracers of rune-embossed elk leather, reinforced with moonsilver rivets that gleam like pale stars. Though Okopa was disquieted by them, many in the [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] have delighted in turning their malice against the hated usurpers. Their last wielder perished rescuing a newly Exalted Lunar; the tales disagree on the weapons’ fate.

Waive the [[Defense]] penalty for making piercing attacks (Exalted, p. 586) with the Ichneumon Blades.
