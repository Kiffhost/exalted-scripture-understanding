Those who spend too long meditating on the numinous, the transcendent, and the infinite are at risk of this rare fever of the soul. It festers in its victim’s [[Essence]], posing the greatest threat to the most powerful. The hallucinations, disorientation, and spiritual malaise it causes grow stronger as its victim spends [[Essence]], seeping deeper into their soul. Medical treatment is useless unless enhanced by magic. 
# Minor
Once per day, the victim loses one [[Willpower]] when he spends five or more motes in an instant, suffering exacerbated symptoms. 
# Major
As above, and hallucinations at the edge of the victim’s peripheral vision inflict a −1 penalty on rolls requiring intense focus, concentration, or attention to detail and −1 [[Resolve]]. Spending five or motes in an instant exacerbates this, increasing both penalties by one for the rest of the scene, maximum (victim’s [[Essence]]). 
# Defining
As above, and the victim’s penalty is added to the mote cost of all magic he uses. Effects without mote costs are unaffected. 
# Death
The victim’s [[Essence]] rages unrestrained, destroying his body from within while his mind is locked in a ceaseless hallucination, a fever-dream that lasts until his [[Essence]] has fully consumed him. Mortals never reach this stage.
