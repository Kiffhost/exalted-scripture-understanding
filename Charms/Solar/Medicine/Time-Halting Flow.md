The Lawgiver can hold back the hands of time. The Exalt channels her [[Essence]] and strikes the soul of a terminally ill, comatose, or mortally wounded patient, flooding their chakras with sustaining Solar [[Essence]]. For as long as this Charm is committed, any disease or poison interval is permanently halted, and unless done direct harm by external forces, the patient’s physical injuries cannot drive them into a worse condition. While under the effect of this Charm, the patient’s vital signs drop to virtually nothing, and they stop aging entirely. This Charm allows the Solar the time she needs to devise an effective treatment or to handle threats to life and limb without losing her patient. Healing the patient does not automatically restore them to consciousness. This Charm can be disrupted by an attack on the patient, or by an impassioned plea for them to wake up, if it is coming from someone for whom they hold a Major or Defining Tie. It automatically ends if the Exalt dies or ends her commitment.

### On [[Time-Halting Flow]]

In case your Solar should need to postpone treatment, or the character has an ailment she hasn’t figured out how to deal with yet. The Abyssal version of this is bound to be nasty.
