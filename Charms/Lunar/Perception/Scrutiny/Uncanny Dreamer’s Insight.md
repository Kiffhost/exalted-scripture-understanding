*The Lunar’s preternatural intuitions reveal themselves in dreams.*
When she sleeps, the Storyteller reveals an opportunity to use [[Awareness]] or [[Investigation]] that she missed that day — a location she failed to case, a suspicious character she should have profiled, a hidden trap she overlooked, etc. If multiple opportunities exist, the Storyteller should choose the one most useful to the Lunar’s current pursuits. She can spend ten motes to make the relevant roll retroactively, reliving her memories of that event. If this uncovers useful information, she gains one [[Willpower]]. She can reflexively activate [[Perceiving the Hidden World]] or [[Scent of Midnight Dweomers]], if she knows them, applying their benefits as she relives the memory.
