*The broken Mask obscures Sidereals from memory.* 
When someone leaves a Sidereal’s presence (or vice versa), he forgets her completely. He remembers the results of her actions, but attributes them to someone or something else. This doesn’t apply to knowledge of the Sidereal Exalted as a whole, only to individual Sidereals. 
## Resisting Arcane Fate
Nontrivial characters can roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) at difficulty 7 to resist a Sidereal’s arcane fate. Quick Characters without an applicable pool roll (base [[Resolve]] x2). Ties to the Sidereal add ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice on this roll, and a character’s history with an existing Sidereal, knowledge of Sidereals in general, and other circumstances may grant similar bonuses.
Additionally, a nontrivial character with a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to a Sidereal can roll as above if he later encounters her again to regain any memories of her that he’s lost to arcane fate. At the [[Storyteller]]’s discretion, something that reminds him of the Sidereal or that gives him reason to suspect his memories have altered may also let him roll.  Arcane fate is a mind-altering [[Charm Keywords#Shaping|Shaping]] effect (p. 156). Magic that specifically protects against memory-altering [[Charm Keywords#Psyche|Psyche]] effects can also be used against it.
Some characters are immune arcane fate: - Other Sidereals and gods in the [[Bureau of Destiny]].
- [[Enemies of fate]] (p. XX) — those who’re Exalted or have Essence 5+.
- A Sidereal's familiars, sorcerously-bound spirits, and beings she’s created, animated, or summoned with magic.  - A Sidereal player character’s Circlemates are immune to her arcane fate (This doesn’t represent an in-setting immunity; it’s an abstraction to help facilitate mixed Circle play). 
## Blank Pages
Documents and other recorded information about Sidereals — either individually or a whole — are also subject to arcane fate. They’re lost, destroyed, or otherwise rendered inaccessible through subtle manipulations of fate. This doesn’t apply to records that maintained by characters immune to arcane fate, nor to those that contain only minimal detail or that describe Sidereals with vague, indirect, or symbolic language, like the [[Immaculate Texts]]. 
There aren’t specific rules for arcane fate’s applicability to records. The Storyteller can invoke it when dramatically appropriate. Such records might still be retrieved or reconstructed; rolls to do so have a minimum difficulty of 7.
# Resplendent Destinies
Sidereals shield themselves from arcane fate with resplendent destinies, mystical “cover identities” drawn from the themes and archetypes of the constellations. A resplendent destiny isn’t a specific individual or even a fully fleshed-out persona, but a loosely sketched-out role or “stock character.” A Sidereal might seem to be a fisherman, but not Yasa the fisherman. A resplendent destiny doesn’t change a Sidereal’s appearance. Instead, those who interact with her mentally “fill in” details that cause her to seem like a soldier, a tax collector, an arrogant Dynast, etc.
Resplendent destinies are tied to and informed by [[constellations]].
## Creating and Using
Creating a resplendent destiny takes a [[Time#Scene|scene]] and costs one [[Willpower]]. The [[Sidereal]] might pore over star charts to calculate horoscopes, perform a ritual using a constellation’s trappings, meditate on fate’s mysteries, or chant a constellation’s scripture. A Sidereal can have up to (Essence + 3) total resplendent destinies. Discarding an unwanted resplendent destiny is similar to creating one, taking a scene. Memories of a discarded destiny — or a resplendent destiny destroyed for any other reason — are erased by arcane fate.
Once per scene, a Sidereal can don a resplendent destiny as a [[Miscellaneous|miscellaneous action]]. She can slough off a resplendent destiny reflexively. This leaves her without protection from arcane fate until she dons a new resplendent destiny, though she can’t don a new one in the same scene. Only one resplendent destiny can be active at a time.
If a Sidereal’s [[The Anima Banner|anima]] reaches bonfire, her resplendent destiny recedes, and she can’t don new ones until it falls to burning or lower.
## Effects
Wearing a resplendent destiny grants the following benefits: 
- The Sidereal fits perfectly into her role. 
	- Characters will accept the cover completely unless given a reason not to.
	- She can intuitively tell what would be "out of character" (The Storyteller should warn the player).
- People who know the Sidereal won’t recognize the two as being the same person based on appearance alone as long as the Sidereal takes even the most rudimentary attempts to conceal her identity. 
	- A scarf, eyepatch, or haircut is sufficient to conceal any resemblance. 
	- Other evidence might still lead such characters to realize this, including watching the Sidereal don the destiny.
	- This also applies to recognising the Sidereal's other resplendent destinies.
- Rolls opposing such disguises which fit the Sidereal's role suffer a −3 penalty. 
	- E.g., infiltrating an enemy army’s camp in the guise of one of their own while wearing a soldier’s destiny. 
	- This doesn’t apply to disguises impersonating specific individuals.
- Memories and records of the resplendent destiny aren’t subject to arcane fate.
Characters who are immune to arcane fate are also unaffected by resplendent destinies, seeing the Sidereal for who she truly is.
## Blowing Your Cover
*Resplendent destinies are ephemeral things, tricks of seeming and suggestions of identity. Their rudimentary details quite literally do not hold up to scrutiny: If a Sidereal leaves inconsistencies in her cover, they could unravel the resplendent destiny.*
When something threatens to compromise a resplendent destiny, the Sidereal makes a cover check, rolling (Essence + 2, maximum 7) dice. This can’t be modified by any means. The difficulty ranges from 1 to 4, depending on the severity of the compromise and who observes it — see examples below. Characters who are immune to arcane fate never count as observers for determining difficulty.
On a failed cover check, the Sidereal’s resplendent destiny is frayed for the rest of the story. If it was already frayed, it’s permanently lost instead. The Sidereal suffers spiritual backlash from the unwoven destiny, leaving her unable to create new resplendent destinies with the same role for the rest of the story. Even after that, she can’t recreate the specific details or established identity of the lost destiny.
The most common reasons for cover checks are:
### Acting Out of Character
A resplendent destiny requires a Sidereal to actually live its role to some extent. Failing to do so risks her cover’s integrity. The cover check has difficulty 1 if the Sidereal is the only person aware of the act, difficulty 2 if she was observed, or difficulty 3 if she was observed by someone who’s very familiar with what’s appropriate for her role. If the Sidereal’s out-of-character act was a significant deviation from her role, the difficulty is increased by +1. 
### Bonfire Anima
Reaching bonfire anima for the first time in a scene forces a cover check if there are any observers, in addition to sloughing off the resplendent destiny. The difficulty depends on the number of witnesses: difficulty 1 for a few people, difficulty 2 for a crowd, difficulty 3 for a village or neighborhood, or difficulty 4 for much of a city. Resplendent destinies of Sidereal Exalted, such as those based on the constellation of The Sorcerer, never face cover checks for this, and magic that lets the Sidereal alter her anima’s appearance may extend this benefit to resplendent destinies of other Exalted.
### Have We Met Before?
When someone who’s met both the resplendent destiny and the Sidereal (or a different resplendent destiny) connects the dots between the two, they risk fraying that destiny. If the Sidereal gives someone reason to suspect the two are related, she must make a difficulty 2 cover check. If it makes them fully believe that the two are the same, the check is difficulty 4. This is only caused by people who’re interacting with the Sidereal or observing her directly — distant revelations don’t count.
