*The deathknight borrows the whispers of her titanic masters, for whom language is mere contrivance.*
The Abyssal speaks in an anti-language, a discordant rasping that can be understood by all creatures of darkness — most notably, the undead and demons. She adds ([[Essence]]) automatic successes on influence rolls with any Ability against creatures of darkness, and waives Primeval Tongue Echo’s cost when used to understand them. Those incapable of understanding her speech find it painful to hear, and count as having a Minor Tie of animosity toward the deathknight.
Once per session, when the Abyssal uses this Charm to communicate with someone who speaks a language that’s extinct or nearly dead in Creation, she gains ([[Essence]]) motes and one [[Willpower]] from this connection to eons of linguistic death.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal may invoke her [[Whispers]] to make her speech understandable to anyone who has a negative [[Intimacy]].
