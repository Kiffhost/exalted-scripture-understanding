*The Infernal is a dancer without mortal peer, forgetting the wrongs and injustices she has suffered as she abandons all in the dance.*

The Infernal gains a bonus dot of Appearance, which can raise it above 5. While she’s dancing, characters can’t ignore her or leave before the performance ends unless they pay one Willpower. Interrupting the performance or initiating hostilities costs two Willpower. This doesn’t apply if she begins to dance while in combat.

This Charm ends if the Infernal attacks or takes other hostile action. She can’t use it again for the rest of the day.
