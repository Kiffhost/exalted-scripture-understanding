Shining Ice Mirror exhales a freezing breath when the Solar’s technique sends her opponent into fatal disarray. This Evocation may be activated after the Solar crashes her opponent with Shining Ice Mirror to wreathe the foe in a numbing cold. Until they recover from Initiative Crash, they suffer a -2 penalty to all actions and a -1 penalty to Defense. 

## Special activation rules

In order to awaken this Evocation, the Solar must first share a perfect moment of killing resolve with the daiklave—she must slay a significant opponent whose health track is undamaged in a single decisive attack.
