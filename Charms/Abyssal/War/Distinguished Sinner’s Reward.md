*Sinners The Abyssal elevates a loyal killer to her honor guard of grim lieutenants, rewarding his service with a sign of her favor.*
The deathknight spends a scene commending a favored soldier, giving him a symbol or token of her favor: the insignia of his new rank, a ceremonial sword, one of the Company of Martial Sinners’ masks. He must have a Defining Tie from Loyal Unto Death. So long as he keeps that Defining Tie and bears the Abyssal’s gift, he gains the following
- +1 Resolve. This increases to +2 Resolve against fear-based influence or influence opposed by his Tie of loyalty.
- Other characters with Ties to the Abyssal from Loyal Unto Death apply those Ties to him as well.
- Once per day, he can add (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) successes on a War roll or threaten roll.
- The Abyssal’s gift is as durable as an artifact.
The Abyssal can stack this Charm for up to (Essence x2) characters. Uses past the first cost one mote, one Willpower.
With War 5, Essence 4, the Abyssal can act through these favored lieutenants for Acclaimed Company of Sinners and Hardened Killer Training Style. She can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use those Charms from afar when her lieutenants commend or train troops.
