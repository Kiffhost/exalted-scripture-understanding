The Lawgiver wears her scars like armor. In a [[Decision Points|decision point]] she may cite something precious that she lost in defense of a [[Intimacy|Principle]] she still holds. Perhaps she lost an eye or a limb, or had to let go of someone she loved in order to pursue the path she’s now on. In doing so, she can resolve the [[Decision Points|decision point]] without paying a point of [[Willpower]], and without tapping a relevant [[Intimacy]] (if any even exist). This Charm can only be used once per story, but can be reset by successfully resisting influence regarding the defended [[Intimacy|Principle]] twice more.

### On [[Strength from Conviction Stance]]

The backer wanted something weighty and emotionally charged — a Charm to help demonstrate the strength and courage of a tremendously dedicated individual who has endured suffering in the pursuit of their cause. This Charm is uncanny, because at a glance it appears simple, but it is a little more complicated than it seems, yet at the same time it’s very easy to grasp when looking backward from the social influence system. If you’re a little fuzzy on [[decision points]], this Charm functions by modifying the rule on Exalted page 221, third paragraph under the “Overturning Influence” header, about overturning influence by citing what has come before. Only it expands the definition of what you are allowed to cite, and doesn’t require an [[Intimacy]]. (You might have lost a [[Intimacy|Tie]] when a loved one died, but did you have an [[Intimacy]] for your lost eye? Probably not.) It also doesn’t require that you be under the effect of an ongoing persuade action; it simply treats your [[Intimacy|Principle]] as if it has the weight of a legendary quest. It’s also recursive; by waiving your need to tap an [[Intimacy]], you can cite the very same reasons the next time you fall into a [[Decision Points|decision point]]. You’ll have to pay the [[Willpower]] and come up with a new [[Intimacy]] if you fall into a third [[Decision Points|decision point]], but I feel the second repetition helps it feel like the Solar’s Conviction is profound.
