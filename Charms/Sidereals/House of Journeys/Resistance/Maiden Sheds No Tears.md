Casting aside her heart, the Sidereal frees herself from the burden of humanity. When the Sidereal uses [[Heartless Maiden Trance]], she may banish her emotions along with her heart. Any emotion-based [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] or Principles of compassion she has are suppressed. She can’t be affected by inspire rolls or rolls to instill emotion-based Ties or Principles of compassion. Psyche effects and mind-altering Shaping effects are suppressed as well. She can’t regain [[Willpower]] from sleep.
