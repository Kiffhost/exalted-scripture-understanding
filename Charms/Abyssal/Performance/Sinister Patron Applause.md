*Think wisely before accepting the Abyssal’s patronage.*
While using [[Morbid Fascination Style]] on another character’s performance, the Abyssal can spend one [[Willpower]] to add (her [[Appearance]]) non-Charm dice on that character’s roll and grant it the effect of [[Culture-Reinforcing Overture]]. The performer automatically gains the [[Intimacy]] instilled by it unless he spends one [[Willpower]] to resist, but doing so denies him this Charm’s benefits.
This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if its target is performing the Abyssal’s own work — playing music composed by her, putting on one of her plays, etc.
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal may use her own Reflexive and Supplemental [[Charms]] to enhance a performer’s roll. However, she can’t combine them with any magic he uses — his player must pick one or the other. If she spends any [[Willpower]] doing so, each point spent increases the [[Willpower]] cost to resist by one, maximum (higher of [[Essence]] or 3).
Battle of the Bands Characters can continue a performance in combat, requiring an unrolled action on each of their turns. It can be flurried, unless a specific effect specifies otherwise.
[[Charms]] that require a character to spend a minute or more performing can’t be used in combat.
