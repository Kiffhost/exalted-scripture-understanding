*The Infernal is a walker of wastes, finding sanctuary in the Endless Desert’s scouring sands.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- Her body no longer produces waste, including sweat. She adds (Survival) to her Stamin to determine how long she can go without food or water (Exalted, p. 232).
- If she suffers penalties due to harsh or inhospitable environs, she reduces them by (Essence/2, rounded up). Such environs include deserts, frozen tundra, rocky wastes, and the Demon City itself. This isn’t limited to environmental penalties — it can reduce visibility penalties from being caught in a sandstorm, movement action penalties from difficult terrain, and the like.
- While traveling through harsh or inhospitable climes, she rerolls 6s on relevant Survival rolls, like navigating, foraging, tracking, and concealing her tracks.
## [[Keys]]
