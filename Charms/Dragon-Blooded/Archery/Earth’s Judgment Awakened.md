Standing calm and centered on the earth, the Dragon-Blood rebukes an attacker with an arrow weighted with the unrelenting force of her will. When she’s standing on an earthen surface and successfully dodges an attack from an enemy within her weapon’s range, she may unleash a decisive counterattack, rolling against the lower of her target’s [[Defense]] or [[Resolve]]. It deals ([[Presence]] + attack roll threshold successes) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. It doesn’t include her [[Initiative]] or reset her to base. This counterattack is incompatible with any effect that lets her move away from her attacker, such as [[Hopping Firecracker Evasion]]. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully disengaging from a nontrivial foe and beginning her next turn at short range or further from all enemies.
