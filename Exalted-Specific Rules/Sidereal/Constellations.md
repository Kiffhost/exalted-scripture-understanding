*The constellations of Creation’s zodiac stand out against the night sky, each presiding over certain threads of fate.*
Sidereals invoke the constellations to create resplendent destinies and speak prophecy. Constellations are also the thematic foundations of [[Sidereal]] [[Charms]]. 

Creation’s cultures demarcate the stars in countless different ways and ascribe vastly different meanings to the same signs. These beliefs and perspectives don’t influence Sidereal magic that draws on the constellations.
