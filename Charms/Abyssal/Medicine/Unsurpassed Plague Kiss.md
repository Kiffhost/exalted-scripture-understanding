*The Abyssalâ€™s strikes carry the touch of remembered plague.*
When the Abyssal makes a successful decisive attack, she exposes her victim to her choice of any disease she has ever suffered or treated. At [[Essence]] 2, she may instead handle food as a vector. [[Essence]] 3 allows her to use prolonged skin-to-skin contact as a vector, while [[Essence]] 5 lets the deathknight employ an airborne vector.
With [[Essence]] 2, the Abyssal may repurchase this Charm, adding a supernatural disease to her repertoire for each repurchase.
