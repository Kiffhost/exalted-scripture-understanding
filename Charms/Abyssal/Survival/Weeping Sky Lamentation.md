*Death’s Lawgiver pours out her sorrows to the world, until even Creation weeps with her.*
The Abyssal rolls ([Charisma or Wits] + [[Survival]]) to alter the weather. She can create or intensify harsh weather like storms or eerie ambiances like rolling mist banks. She can’t create fair weather — though she can dissipate it — nor can she improve foul weather. She also can’t create extreme natural disasters, like hurricanes. She doubles 9s if she uses this Charm in a shadowland or the Underworld, or if she has a [[Survival]] specialty relevant to either the weather or the terrain. If both are true, she doubles 8s.
The roll’s difficulty depends on how drastic a change she wishes to make and how seasonally appropriate it is: creating a gloomy drizzle or turning a sunny day overcast would be difficulty 1; intensifying a heavy rain to a thunderstorm would be difficulty 2-3; calling a storm out of the blue would be difficulty 5+.
If the Abyssal succeeds, her desired changes take place over a matter of minutes or hours, depending on how extensive they are.
The weather can extend up to ([[Survival]] + extra successes) miles from where she used this Charm. It lasts until at least the end of this Charm’s duration. The Abyssal adds ([[Survival]]) dice on inspire rolls that benefit from the ambiance provided by the weather. With a suitable stunt, she can apply this bonus on other rolls.
If other magic would alter the Abyssal’s weather, the character responsible must make an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll opposed by the Abyssal’s ([Charisma or Wits] + [[Survival]]). If he fails, his magic is negated and he can’t change the weather again for the rest of this Charm’s duration.
