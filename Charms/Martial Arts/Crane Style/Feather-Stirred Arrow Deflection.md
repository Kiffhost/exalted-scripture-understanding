*With a mighty beat of its wings, the crane shames feathers bound to arrow shafts.* 
Whenever the martial artist could validly make a counterattack in response to a ranged attack, she may use [[Feather-Stirred Arrow Deflection]] to extend the counterattackâ€™s range to equal the maximum range of the original attack, sending arrows or [[Spear|spears]] back at the foes who cast them. Making a counterattack against a foe at extreme range requires a stunt describing how the martial artist accomplishes this feat. 
Additionally, the martial artist may pay a point of [[Willpower]] when she uses this Charm to direct her ranged counterattack at an enemy other than the one who originally attacked her, as long as her chosen target is within the expanded range of the counter. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood cannot make counterattacks at greater than long range.
