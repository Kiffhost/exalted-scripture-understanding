Endlessly elusive, the Lunar extricates herself from even the most tenacious suspicions. When she observes one or more characters discussing someone whose identity they don’t know, or infers that such an unknown person is on those characters’ minds, she employs subtle mannerisms and social cues to make them completely certain that the unknown person is neither the Lunar nor her current shape. Her targets must be able to see or hear her, though she need not directly address them. This certainty can be leveraged through social influence as though it were a Minor [[Intimacy]]. A character may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist this Charm, becoming immune for one scene. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as an [[Appearance]] Charm, with [[Perfect Symmetry]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
