An enterprising Dynast sorcerer bound a recalcitrant metody’s core into this child-sized doll to clean for him, drawing on the demon’s affinity for the passive, consumptive nature of vitriol. He soon traded it away, after his spouse developed a particular loathing for the silent servant. The marionette’s articulated joints show subtle signs of wear from the metody’s corrosive Essence, and all color has been bleached from the doll’s hair. Its glass eyes were seared away from the inside long ago, so that the metody-core within can see more clearly.

When inactive, the marionette lies inert. When attuned for three motes, it comes to life. It serves its master loyally and understands all languages she knows, but can’t speak or write. It must consume at least a mouthful of something each hour, or it falls inert. Its master’s attunement is broken, and it can’t be reattuned until a day has passed. It also falls inert if it’s separated from its master for an entire day.

The marionette doesn’t heal naturally. Repairing a single level of damage requires an hour-long basic repair project with a difficulty of (1 + wound penalty). If it’s incapacitated, clearing its Incapacitated level requires a day-long major project with difficulty 5.

##### Merits
###### Construct-Body
The marionette is immune to poison, disease, and fatigue. It has no need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, apart from what’s needed to avoid dormancy.
###### Caustic Loyalty
The marionette’s listed Intimacies can’t be altered or weakened by any means. Any other Intimacies it gains are weakened by one step whenever it returns to its inert state.
###### Grime-Gobbler
The marionette can consume any mundane substance it can fit in its child-sized mouth. It can lick surfaces clean with its foot-long, yellowish-green tongue, without any risk of accidentally damaging the surface.
###### Corrosive Spit
The marionette can attack by spitting acid out to short range.
###### Puppeteer’s Strings
The marionette always knows which direction its master is, as long as she’s in the same realm of existence.
###### Tiny Creature
Add +2 Evasion against larger foes’ attacks. Larger characters subtract two successes from Awareness-based rolls to notice the marionette.
