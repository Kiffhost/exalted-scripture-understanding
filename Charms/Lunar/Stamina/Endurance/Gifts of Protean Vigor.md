The Lunar’s mastery of shapeshifting affords precise control of her metabolism and bodily processes.
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Lunar gains two of the following gifts. She may purchase additional gifts for one bonus point or three experience each.
Internal Form 
## Mastery
The Lunar gains up to three dots of the [[Boundless Endurance]], [[Iron Stomach]], [[Natural Immunity]], [[Selective Conception]], [[Strong Lungs]], or [[Toxin Resistance]] [[Merits]]. This boon can be purchased multiple times.
Lesson of the Camel: The Lunar doubles her [[Stamina]] to determine how long she can go without food, water, and air, and reduces deprivation penalties by one (Exalted, p. 232).
No [[Time]] to Bleed: The Lunar doesn’t increase the time it takes to heal from damage for engaging in strenuous physical activity (Exalted, pp. 173-174), and treats such activities as bedrest for purposes of magic like WoundMending Care Technique.
[[Plague]]-Ridden Mimicry: The Lunar can voluntarily induce symptoms of disease and immune responses in herself, like fever, nausea, rashes, or sweating. Sustaining a high fever or similar symptoms adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on rolls against disease indefinitely, but inflicts a −1 penalty on mental rolls. Attempts at diagnosing the Lunar return a result consistent with her apparent condition unless the opposing character uses magic or has reason to suspect the Lunar of trickery.
In the latter case, a diagnosis roll at difficulty (Lunar’s [[Essence]] + [[Stamina]]) will reveal that something’s amiss.
Tiger-and-Seahorse Dynasty: The Lunar’s children inherit her [[Exalted Healing]] (Exalted, p. 165), in addition to any gifts they may receive as one of the MoonTouched. She receives +2 [[Resolve]] against influence that would cause her to neglect or harm her children.
Winter Without Hibernation: The Lunar only needs (6 – [[Stamina]]) hours of sleep each night. Any fatigue penalties she suffers are reduced by one.
