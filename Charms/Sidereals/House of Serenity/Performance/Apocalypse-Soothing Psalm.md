The Sidereal’s performance heals a troubled world, shaping its [[Essence]] into a pattern that leaves no place for suffering. As long as the Sidereal continues to perform, she and everyone present in the scene — friend or foe — becomes impervious to all forms of physical harm, Psyche effects, Shaping effects, curses, possession and other hostile effects. This doesn’t prevent social influence, nor does it undo effects already in place. If an aggressor’s harmful act is negated, he experiences what it would have been like to suffer it in a flash of empathy. This doesn’t harm him, but gives him a Minor [[Intimacy]] chosen by his player expressing reluctance to employ such force or weakens an [[Intimacy]] that supports doing so by one step. The Sidereal can’t take non-reflexive actions during this performance. Enemies wishing to disrupt this Charm’s protection might do so by using social influence to convince her to abandon the performance. 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal can’t use this Charm if she or an ally’s taken a hostile action this scene. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] or accomplishing a major character or story goal by helping opposing parties reach peace or helping a community weather a crisis. Joybringers can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect this way.
