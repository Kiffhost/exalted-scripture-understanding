*The Infernal becomes a warped mirror of her beloved foe, shattering her own selfhood to become his perfect antithesis.*

The Infernal makes a special read intentions roll to discern a character’s foremost goal, ambition, or motivation. This may be expressed by one of his Intimacies, but if not, the Storyteller should give a brief description.

If the Infernal succeeds, she remakes herself as a perfect nemesis. She gains a Principle that is directly opposed or antithetical to her target’s goals. It has the same intensity as his own Intimacy, or Minor if he doesn’t have one. She also gains a Minor Tie of spiteful hate toward him.
- The Intimacies granted by this Charm can’t be fully eroded, only reduced to Minor intensity. The Infernal can’t voluntarily weaken them.
- Any Intimacies representing the Infernal’s own goals are suppressed.
- While observing her nemesis, she can intuit when his Resolve is bolstered or penalized by one of his Intimacies, though not what the Intimacy is. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on read intentions rolls to uncover these Intimacies.
- If the Infernal discovers another of her nemesis’ Intimacies, she instantly forms a Minor Intimacy that’s opposed to it — a Tie with the opposite emotional context, or an antithetical Principle. Unlike this Charm’s other Intimacies, these can be fully eroded, although the Infernal can’t voluntarily weaken them.
- If her nemesis’ overarching goals change for some reason, the Infernal intuitively senses this as her antagonistic Principle changes to match.

This Charm ends if the Infernal fully accomplishes her antagonistic design, utterly ruining her nemesis’ plans. She gains Willpower equal to his (Essence), and loses that much Limit. The Charm also ends if he dies, though this gives her no such satisfaction.
## [[Keys]]
#### Everyone’s Enemy Understanding (Socialize 4)
The Infernal can stack this Charm to mirror up to (higher of Essence or 3) rivals. The mote cost of uses beyond the first is reduced by one.
#### Talent Theft Internalization (Socialize 4) (+2m)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote surcharge when she uses this Charm to temporarily gain (higher of Essence or 3) specialties representing mimicked aspects of her nemesis’ expertise and prowess. She uses the same set of specialties for that nemesis each time she uses this key on him.
#### Puissance Mimicry Intuition (Socialize 5, Essence 3, [[#Talent Theft Internalization (Socialize 4) (+2m)|Talent Theft Internalization]]) (2m per Charm or spell)
When the Infernal uses [[#Talent Theft Internalization (Socialize 4) (+2m)|Talent Theft Internalization]], she can temporarily learn any of her nemesis’ Eclipse Charms, Martial Arts Charms, or spells whose prerequisites she meets. She must commit two motes for each, in addition to [[#Talent Theft Internalization (Socialize 4) (+2m)|Talent Theft Internalization]]’s surcharge. Each mimicked power counts as one specialty for the Infernal’s maximum.
