*The Solar strikes away lesser attacks with speed that can stop the falling rain.*
Upon successfully parrying a trivial opponent, the Solar may use this Charm to strike their weapon away from herself, automatically disarming them. If she has any [[Charms]] which allow her to attack an opponent she has disarmed she may then do so, even if she has already attacked for the round. This Charm explicitly allows the Exalt to switch to a [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] based attack, provided that she makes the attack unarmed or with a legal weapon. This Charm confers no ability to draw such a weapon instantly, however. 
[[Arc Shedding Rain Technique]] can only be used once per round, but maybe reset during the round by successfully parrying any attack while suffering an onslaught penalty of -2 or greater, or by parrying the attack of a dangerous opponent, or by killing any opponent with a Counterattack Charm.

### On [[Arc Shedding Rain Technique]]

The backerâ€™s favorite anime is Moribito, so she wanted a Melee Charm that would help her fight like Balsa. This was a tricky Charm to write, as [[Melee]] [[Charms]] have to work not only with spears, but with axes, swords, claymores, etc. After watching Balsa fight, I decided to make the Charm a very solid defense against greater numbers that would allow the Solar to create openings for [[Charms]] such as [[Savage Wolf Attack]] (Exalted p. 419), or yet-unwritten [[Martial Arts]] or [[Brawl]] [[Charms]]. The Solar parries away an enemy attack and then spin kicks them face down in a rice paddy. Go Balsa or go home. Backer: Lindsay Steussy
