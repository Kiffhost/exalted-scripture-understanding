The Dragon-Blood’s eyes burn with intense flame, incinerating shadows and whatever hides within them. When she makes a vision-based Awareness roll, she rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10 that appears, and ignores penalties from poor lighting, seeing even in total darkness. If she succeeds on a roll opposing the Larceny or Stealth of an enemy within medium range, she may send twin lances of flame streaking from her eyes to strike him, rolling (Essence) dice of lethal damage against him, ignoring Hardness. If a hidden enemy takes damage while hiding in an area of low lighting, his concealment is disrupted as flame illuminates him, forcing him to change hiding places, making a new Stealth roll subject to the −3 penalty for moving. This doesn’t require a move action if he can find new concealment in the same range band; if not, he must reflexively move, consuming his movement action for the round (or his next turn, if he’s already moved this round). If his hiding place is flammable, such as a tree or wooden crate, it’s set ablaze, likewise forcing him to make a new roll. Mundane disguises burn away if any damage is dealt, laying bare the impostor’s identity. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by beating a hidden opponent’s Stealth roll and subsequently, while he’s still in concealment, either landing a decisive attack against him or crashing him with a withering attack.
