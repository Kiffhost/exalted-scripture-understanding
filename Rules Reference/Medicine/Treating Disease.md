Treating [[disease]] is a protracted process, requiring the physician spend at least one hour treating the patient for each day of the sickness’s [[Disease#Interval|interval]]. Depending on the disease, this may require access to medical equipment or costly treatments, the absence of which may increase the difficulty of the roll. At the end of the course of treatment, roll (Intelligence + Medicine). When the victim makes his own roll to resist the disease, he may substitute the result of the physician’s roll for his own if it is higher. 
# Example
Shen is treating a young boy suffering from [[plague]] at the level of a [[Disease#Defining Symptom|defining symptom]], tending to him over the three days of the sickness’s [[Disease#Interval|interval]]. Young and frail, the child’s (Stamina + Resistance) roll yields only one success, a failure that would lead to his [[Disease#Progression#Death|death]]. However, Shen’s skills as a master physician allow him to roll five successes on his (Intelligence + Medicine) roll to treat the child. Instead of dying, the boy begins to recover, as his symptoms are reduced to [[Disease#Major Symptom|major intensity]].
