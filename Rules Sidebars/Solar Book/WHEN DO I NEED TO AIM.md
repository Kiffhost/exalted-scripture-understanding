Characters at medium or long range must typically take an aim action before they can attack. But this is not always true. A character does not need to aim if:
1. She is casting a spell. 
2. She is using a Charm from an Ability or martial art that is not typically ranged to create a ranged attack. Examples: Apocalypse Flare Attack (p. 283), Blazing Solar Bolt (p. 353). 
3. The ranged Charm in question is triggered by some event, objective, or dice result and must be performed instantly. Typically this type of Charm is Reflexive, but not all Reflexive Charms qualify. Examples: Fallen Weapon Deflection (p. 417), Savage Wolf Attack (p. 419). 
4. The ranged Charm in question creates bonus attacks or immediate attacks as a reward for a good dice roll, and it wouldnâ€™t make sense for such attacks not to happen instantly. Example: Swarm-Culling Instinct (p. 416). 
5. If a Charm resets her combat action. 
6. If a Charm states she can waive the aim action.
