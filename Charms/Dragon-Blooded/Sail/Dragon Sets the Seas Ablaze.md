The dragon admiral’s burning fury reduces enemy fleets to charred cinders. The Exalt makes a broadside stratagem (Exalted, p. 245) with double 9s, discharging her anima through her ship’s weaponry to set the enemy ship aflame. On a successful roll, the enemy ship catches fire and continues to burn for the rest of the scene. At the end of each round, including the round this Charm is used, roll one die of Hull damage against that ship. A captain can direct her crew to put out the fires as a special naval stratagem rolled with (Wits + Sail) that costs two Momentum. If that ship’s captain loses the opposed roll for that stratagem, the ship remains aflame, although it doesn’t take damage from the fire that round. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
