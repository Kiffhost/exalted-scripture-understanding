On each round of [[Donning & Removing Armor|donning armor]] with the prerequisite, the Lawgiver can attack without a flurry by doing a stunt in which she attacks while putting on a piece of armor. If she knows [[Call the Blade]] or [[Summoning the Loyal Steel]], she may use either Charm reflexively for free while [[Armed and Ready Discipline]] is active.

### On [[Armed and Ready Discipline]]

The backer wanted a Charm that would let him use [[Whirlwind Armor-Donning Prana]] and [[Summoning the Loyal Steel]] at the same time, and I thought “why stop there?” It was actually a tricky Charm to work out, since those other [[Charms]] are about as efficient as you can possibly get. In the end I decided to value-add this Charm by allowing you to arm yourself while attacking, punching through vambraces to snap them on, clapping on a breastplate while delivering a spinning slash, drop-kicking into your greaves, and so on.
