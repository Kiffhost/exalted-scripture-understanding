*The ghost of the Moon-Touched sorceress Mishiko often appears to her students in the twilight minutes between day and night as a young girl shaped from moonfire.* She’s tied to Creation by a number of crystalline flowers that emerge unbidden from unexpected places — the sepulcher of an ancient shaman; the site of a lengthy, difficult birth; the vista that inspired a painter’s first work; a tree that once shaded a traveling sage. Each is a sorcerous relic (Exalted, p. 470) as well as a conduit to Mishiko. Gentle and astute, her wisdom comes in the form of poetry, parables, and uncomfortable truths, spurring students to explore and discover. Many young Lunars find the gems gravitating toward them as if by fate; elders speculate that some uncanny force is at work.

## Evocations
Exalted sorcerers may awaken Evocations from a jasmine gem as a three-dot artifact (Arms of the Chosen, p. 18). These may allow greater communion with Mishiko, or draw on themes of mystery, discovery, and questing to enhance her sorcery.
