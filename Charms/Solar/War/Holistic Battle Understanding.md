Looking into the Essence of the battlefield, the Solar tactician knows the forces arrayed against her, if not in fact then in unerring instinct. This Charm supplements the Strategic Maneuver roll (see p. 211) to establish a stratagem, allowing the Solar to ignore all penalties from unfamiliarity with the opposing force or its generals.
