The Exalt’s anima melds with the words of ancient dead things into an aura of disdainful whispers and [[Essence]]. When an enemy who’s prone or who the wearer has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of contempt for hits her with a withering attack, she may use this Evocation to counterattack with a ([Charisma or Appearance] + [[Presence]]) threaten roll against the attacker’s [[Resolve]], adding ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm bonus dice. If she succeeds, he gains no [[Initiative]] from his attack. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with soulsteel cannot awake this Evocation. 

## Resonant

A successful counterattack also halves the withering damage dealt to the wearer (round down).
