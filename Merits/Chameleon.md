The character can change the color and pattern of her skin to match her surroundings. She adds a die to [[Stealth]] rolls, and to [[Survival]] rolls to hunt for game. If sheâ€™s not wearing any clothes, add two dice.
### Drawback
When the character is nervous or stressed, she must make a [[Willpower]] roll (difficulty 1) to keep her skin from reflexively shifting a few shades toward the dominant color of the surroundings, giving her away as a likely Wyld mutant.
