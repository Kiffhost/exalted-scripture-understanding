The First Age was raised by the hands of the Solar Exalted, and they alone can restore its lost glories. When using Breach-Healing Method to repair an Artifact, the Solar may use this Charm to lower the repair difficulty by one. The moment she touches the damaged Artifact, the goal number to repair it is reduced by her (Intelligence * Essence)â€”the Artifact is seen to partially reform, its shattered parts flying together in her hands. This can fully restore certain objects. This Charm may be used once per story, but may be reset by completing an Artifact repair without it.
