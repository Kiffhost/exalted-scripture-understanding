*Having cast her mortality aside, Death’s Lawgiver scoffs at plague and poison.*
The Abyssal rerolls 1s until they cease to appear on rolls against disease and poison. She’s immune to any such ailment that she’s previously been exposed to.
With [[Stamina]] 3, the morbidity of a disease the Abyssal is exposed to can’t exceed 5 — even for diseases that wouldn’t normally allow a morbidity roll.
