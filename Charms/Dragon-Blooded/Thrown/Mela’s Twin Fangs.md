*The Dragon-Blood palms a weapon from Elsewhere as she attacks with another weapon, throwing one in the shadow of the other.*
To use this Charm, she must have at least one weapon banished with its prerequisite and another readied. She makes two withering attacks against a single enemy â€” one with the readied weapon, and another with the banished weapon, which she recalls to her hand. She only gains [[Initiative]] from the attack that deals the highest damage.
