When the Lawgiver is caught somewhere she doesn’t belong, she may use this Charm to immediately become aware of a gap in her inquisitor’s knowledge she can exploit. Stopped at a picket, she realizes the soldier questioning her is expecting a messenger he has never seen. She can then claim that messenger’s identity. Confronted by a tenant when creeping through the glass towers of Chiaroscuro, she realizes there are vacant rooms and assumes the role of a squatter. Uncertainty of this kind counts as a Minor Intimacy when it is exploited.
