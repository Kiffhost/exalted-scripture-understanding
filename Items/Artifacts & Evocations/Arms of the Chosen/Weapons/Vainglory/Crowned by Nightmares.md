Vainglory’s unearthly jewels gather the light of the Exalt’s anima, congealing it into a ghastly radiance that sears the souls of her enemies. While the Exalt’s anima is at bonfire, each character that can see her suffers a penalty to his Defense against her attacks equal to the rating of her highest negative Intimacy toward him. 

## Resonant

The Exalt may use this Evocation reflexively and waive its Willpower cost when she wins Join Battle while at bonfire anima.
