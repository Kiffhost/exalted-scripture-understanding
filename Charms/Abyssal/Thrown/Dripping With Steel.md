*The Abyssal adorns herself with blades, dazzling her soon-to-be victims.*
The Abyssal conceals a Thrown weapon on her person, wearing it as an accessory, incorporating it into her outfit. If she knows Improvised Assassin’s Trick, this can be used on any object she could throw. Onlookers won’t recognize it as a weapon, even if it’s still freshly bloodied. This Charm ends if she readies the weapon or takes other overtly hostile action.
The Abyssal can stack this Charm to conceal multiple weapons.
