*Otherworldly [[Familiar]] Pact Drawing from the wellspring of her own divinity and the heart’s blood flowing in her veins, the Lunar looses one of the countless beasts that dwell within her as a feral spirit.*
The Lunar performs a ritual under the full moon, lasting from the time it rises to the time it sets, as she invokes one of the animals whose heart’s blood she possesses.
As she channels bestial [[Essence]], she might exhibit fits of animalistic behavior, uncontrolled shapeshifting, or glossolalia in the secret tongues of beasts. At the ritual’s culmination, the primal force inhabiting the Lunar emerges as a beast-spirit, a divine personification of that animal. The Lunar loses the shape the spirit was born from. She can’t choose her spirit shape; there can be no greater embodiment of it than her.
None would mistake a beast-spirit for an ordinary animal. Some are humanoid in form, or have a human’s face or a human-like mask in place of a bestial visage. Some have multiple eyes, tails, limbs, or even heads. They have intelligence comparable to a human’s.
A beast-spirit uses the same traits as its animal form, plus the below:  - It’s a spirit, rather than an animal. It’s naturally material, but can dematerialize, using the same rules as materializing (Exalted, p. 510), but in reverse. If slain, it reforms at the Lunar’s side on the next full moon.
 - It’s the Lunar’s familiar.
 - It has [[Essence]] 3 and a pool of (50 + {Essence x10}) motes.
 - It has a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to the Lunar, which can’t be weakened or altered by any means. Upon creation, it has one other Defining [[Intimacy]] and two Major [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], typically reflecting some aspects of its animal’s instincts, behavior, or socialization.
 - It knows Hurry Home (Exalted, p. 509), allowing it to return to the Lunar, and (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) additional spirit [[Charms]] appropriate to its animal’s nature, the symbolic significance it has to the Lunar, or the beast-spirit’s changed form. Animal avatars’ [[Charms]] (p. 87) are often appropriate. It gains new [[Charms]] as the Lunar’s [[Essence]] increases, and an additional Charm at the end of any story in which it played a meaningful role.
This Charm’s experience point cost is waived the first time the Lunar uses it. If a beast-spirit is permanently destroyed or otherwise becomes narratively irrelevant, the Lunar’s player regains the experience spent to create it.
