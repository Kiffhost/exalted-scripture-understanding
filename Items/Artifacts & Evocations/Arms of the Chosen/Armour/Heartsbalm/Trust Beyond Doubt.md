This Evocation upgrades [[Transcendent Hero’s Meditation]] (Exalted, p. 308), reducing its cost by ([[Intimacy]]) motes when the wearer invokes it in response to influence that opposes her [[Intimacy|Tie]] to her beloved. If the influence would cause her to harm or endanger her beloved, she may break free from it instantly, without needing to spend time in meditation.
