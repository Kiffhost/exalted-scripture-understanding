Mirroring the fate of the world around her, the Sidereal bends the wilderness to her will. The Sidereal can shape the geography of the land around her, rolling (Charisma + Survival) to transform, relocate, create, or destroy a natural feature or localized weather phenomenon within long range. She need not take overt action to do so; the world changes to accommodate her desires. She can’t shape buildings and other artificial structures. Shaping natural features that span up to (Essence/2, rounded up) range bands can be done instantly. Tasks that could be accomplished with mundane efforts and a day’s work are difficulty 1-2; other changes are difficulty 3+, based on the size, complexity, and durability of the natural feature and the nature of the change. Relocations and small changes are easiest; significant changes are more difficult; and creation and destruction are hardest. Relocated features can’t be moved more than (Essence) range bands. Altering larger natural features—changing a river’s course, raising a large hill from the earth, stirring a thunderstorm—is an extended roll. The difficulty for each interval is as above; the goal number is (interval difficulty x5). The interval is one week by default, but more significant alterations may have longer intervals at the Storyteller’s discretion. Creating or destroying mountains, oceans, islands, and other vast geographic features is possible with this Charm, but would be the work of centuries.
