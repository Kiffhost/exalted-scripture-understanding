*Singing a stirring melody that rouses passion and deep emotions, the Nightingale suffuses each note with the resonant hum of aural Essence.*
The martial artist rolls (Charisma + Performance) to inspire all enemies who can hear her with sorrow, regret, despair, or some other emotion that would impede their will to fight. She is not hindered by targeting multiple enemies and adds her Essence in bonus successes to the roll. An enemy who yields to these emotions takes a -3 penalty to Defense against any kiai attacks the martial artist makes, as long as she stunts them in a way that exploits the inspired emotion.
Once an enemy has paid Willpower to resist this influence, he remains immune to it for the remainder of the scene.
Unlike other Simple Charms, Haunting Heart-Rending Melody may be placed in a flurry. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood gains no bonus successes when using this Charm.
