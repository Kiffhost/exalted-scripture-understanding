*The Infernal looses an arrow like a bolt of demonic lightning, and thunder follows after.*

The Infernal makes a withering or decisive attack against an enemy within short range. If it deals 5+ withering damage or any decisive damage, its target is knocked back one range band. If he's bashed against an object or surface, he suffers an additional (Essence) dice of the same type of damage dealt by the attack, ignoring soak and Hardness. An enemy who is crashed by the attack or takes 3+ decisive damage doesn't regain Willpower the next time he sleeps, his dreams filled with endless thunder.

Alternatively, the Infernal can use the thunderclap to make a ranged feat of demolition, rolling (Strength + Archery). She adds her weapon's Accuracy bonus to this roll and to her effective Strength for the feat.
