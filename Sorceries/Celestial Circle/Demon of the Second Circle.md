Celestial sorcerers may call upon demons of the Second Circle, baleful spirits that serve the Yozis. The ritual to summonaSecondCircleDemonismuchlikethatdescribed in Demon of the First Circle, save that it can only be performed on the night of the new moon (and then only once per lunar cycle), or once during one of the five black nightsofCalibration.Insteadofpullingthedemonthrough a glowing green glyph, tongues of green fire trace out a mandala that is the demon’s name written in the alphabet of Hell, and it emerges from this circle at the sorcerer’s call. The roll to bind Second Circle Demons is the same as with First Circle Demons, but failure is more dangerous. If the sorcerer fails her (Intelligence + Occult) roll against the demon’s Resolve by three successes or more, then she is unable to banish the demon, and must contend with its wrath or wiles.
