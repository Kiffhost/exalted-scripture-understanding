# [[Emerald Gyre of Aeons Style]]
Jehu Khoor aged a thousand years in a single blow from the Prince of Hours and glimpsed the shape of eternity thereby. He spent the remainder of his life both creating this style to express this understanding and authoring the Tractate of Eternity. The text is infamously impenetrable, equal parts metaphysical treatise, theory of history, and mystical allegory. It has no end and no beginning, endlessly recursive. Interpretations vary wildly: Raxevi Alzira views the Tractate as an allegory of the events of Creation’s history; Countervalent Raven sees it as a guide to escaping the prison of eternity.
Students of this style consume heavy quantities of hashish, salvia, and other drugs that alter their perception of time before practicing circle walking, breathing exercises, and weapon drills. They also devote much time to the study of Khoor’s text, or at least their teacher’s explanation of it. One traditionally concludes their training by penning their own exegesis, creating a body of interpretation, critiques, and commentary as dense as the text itself.
## Weapons
This style specializes in striking while moving, using open-palm blows and spinning kicks whose force comes from the stylist’s spiraling body movements. It’s also compatible with kusarigama, meteor hammers (p. XX), nunchaku (p. XX), rope darts (p. XX), staffs, seven-section staffs, and wind-and-fire wheels. 
## Armour
This style is incompatible with armor.
## Complementary Abilities
Stylists use [[Lore]] to study this style’s foundational text and to understand the nature of time so that they may manipulate it.
