*!!Whetherdiningonfesteringcarrionortakingpoisoned!! banquets at a queen’s table, the Lunar is a consummate gourmand, adapting to whatever she consumes.*
She may digest and derive sustenance from any mundane living or once-living substance — including inedible substances — and adds ([[Stamina]]) non-Charm dice to resist ingested poisons. She can also eat any amount of food without harm; doing so quickly, such as for corpse disposal, is a ([[Stamina]] + {Athletics or Survival}) roll. With [[Stamina]] 5, the Lunar can safely digest any mundane material, although feats of demolition may be required to break down larger objects into portions she can swallow. She’s completely immune to mundane ingested poisons.
