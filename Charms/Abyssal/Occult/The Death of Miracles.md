*Through ritual, the Abyssal may sunder the miracles of [[sorcery]], withering blessed fields and slaughtering generational curses.*
After encountering the ongoing effects of a spirit Charm or a spell, the Abyssal rolls ([[Intelligence]] or [[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) to introduce a method by which that magic may be undone. This roll is opposed by the character who created the effect, using an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) combination. If successful, the Abyssal’s player and the [[Storyteller]] should work together to determine a way that she can end the magic.
The effort required to do so should be commensurate with the effect’s strength. This can’t reverse Instantduration effects, or magic used by [[Essence]] 10 beings. If the Abyssal breaks a magical effect with this Charm, the opposing character becomes aware of it, sensing the affront to his primacy.
An [[Essence]] 4 repurchase lets the Abyssal pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to introduce a way to permanently undo a Terrestrial sorcerous working, or temporarily suppress a Celestial or Solar working long enough for her to accomplish a significant task.
