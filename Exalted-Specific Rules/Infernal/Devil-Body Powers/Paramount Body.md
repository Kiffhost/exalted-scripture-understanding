The Infernal’s ascended body is beyond the weakness of lesser forms. As long as she isn’t crashed, she’s immune to crippling penalties, body-altering Shaping effects, poison, disease, deprivation, and other frailties of flesh. She ignores any such ongoing effects as long as she is in her [[Devil-Body]] form.

While crashed, the Infernal halves such penalties instead, rounded down and adds (higher of Essence or 3) to her static values or in automatic successes on rolls against such effects.
