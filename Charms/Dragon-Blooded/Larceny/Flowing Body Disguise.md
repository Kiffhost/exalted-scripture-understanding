*The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s subtle arts make her appearance as fluid as water.*
She ignores ([[Essence]]) points of penalty on a disguise roll from impersonating a specific character, or disguising herself as someone of another sex, body type, or similar physical traits. If the Dragon-Blood impersonates one of her blood relatives, she adds a non-Charm bonus success on her roll.
