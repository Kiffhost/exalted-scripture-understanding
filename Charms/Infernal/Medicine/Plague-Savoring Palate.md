*The Infernal’s appetite for blight and affliction has been refined to infallibility.*

The Infernal succeeds automatically on a roll to diagnose a patient. For diseases or poisons she has no prior knowledge of, she discerns only the general category of disease or poison they belong to and whether or not they’re supernatural.

If the Infernal successfully diagnoses a character whom she’s capable of eating, she may choose to succumb to a monstrous hunger, gaining a Minor Principle such as “I crave the taste of human flesh.” If she does, she adds a non-Charm success on any Medicine rolls she makes to treat the diagnosed patient’s condition for the rest of the scene.

If the Infernal chooses to take an Intimacy, she can’t voluntarily weaken it as long as she remains in the patient’s presence. Additionally, indulging in her hunger prevents her from doing so until the next time she regains Willpower from resting.
