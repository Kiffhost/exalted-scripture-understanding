The Sidereal brandishes a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and the Scythe, which blossoms with pungent violet flowers whose petals slowly wither, fall, and crumble into dust, a harbinger of death to come. The Sidereal rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against the [[Resolve]] of a character who can see her prayer strip. If she beats his [[Resolve]], he witnesses a vision of his destined death. If his death isn’t planned for in destiny — almost always the case for the Exalted — he instead sees what the Storyteller thinks is the most likely way for him to die based on current conditions. The Storyteller can briefly summarize or skip over Storyteller character’s visions. A player character’s vision can play out as a scene if the playgroup’s interested in doing so or can simply be narrated by the character’s player. The character rolls (current temporary [[Willpower]]); for each failed die, he loses one [[Willpower]] and gains one [[Limit]]. If he loses any [[Willpower]], he gains a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] reflecting fear of death; otherwise, he gains a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] reflecting a positive outlook on death. The foretold death is not inevitable. If the affected character encounters circumstances similar to it and survives, his will to live is redoubled. His current temporary [[Willpower]] is set to ten, which can raise him above his permanent [[Willpower]], and he loses all [[Limit]]. If he has [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] expressing fear of death, they become Principles that oppose that fear, chosen by his player. An Abyssal relives the moment of his Exaltation rather than witnessing his future end; while relieving his near-death is still harrowing, he doesn’t gain [[Limit]] from it.
