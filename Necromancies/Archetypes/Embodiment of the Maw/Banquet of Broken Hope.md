*The necromancer gorges on other’s emotions for power.*
A [[Shape Necromancy]] action awards one additional necromantic mote for every nontrivial target with an [[Intimacy]] of fear towards her within medium range, up to a maximum of (her [[Essence]]) necromantic motes per spell. Once per day, she may instead feed on a single target’s known [[Intimacy]] of despair, gaining (Intensity) necromantic motes instead.
