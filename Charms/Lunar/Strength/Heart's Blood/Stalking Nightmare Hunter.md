Once the Lunar marks her quarry, he’ll never be free of her. She hunts him in his dreams, pursuing him with monstrous inevitability. She chooses a human she’s either damaged with a decisive attack or successfully threatened in the last week and who has a Major or Defining Tie of fear toward her or one of her shapes. The next time he sleeps, she appears in his dreams in whichever of her forms terrifies him most, rolling (Strength + combat Ability) against his Resolve, claiming his form if successful. Claiming a character’s shape this way prevents him from regaining Willpower from that night’s sleep. This Charm can’t be used against the same character more than once per story.
