With a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and the Dust wrapped around her forehead or neck, smelling faintly of lilacs and decay, the Sidereal skips past unnecessary seconds, reducing her actions to instantaneousness. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  She waives the cost of Inexorable Advance, Distance-Severing Stride, and Step-Silencing Exercise. 
-  She waives Shattered Stepping-Stone Advance’s Willpower cost. 
-  She can maintain a speed of (Essence x20) miles per hour over even the harshest terrain, flickering from point to point. 
-  When she flurries, she can take two physical actions and one action of any type. She ignores the Defense penalty for flurrying and can flurry Stealth rolls to establish concealment. 
-  Freed from unnecessary motion, physical exertion doesn’t tire her. She can complete a night’s sleep in a single hour and can run while asleep.
