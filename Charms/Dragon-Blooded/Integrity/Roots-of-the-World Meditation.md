Communing with the endless flow of [[Essence]] through every living thing, the Dragon-Blood draws up this boundless vitality to sustain herself. She must spend (10 − [[Essence]]) hours in meditation, at the end of which she rolls ([[Essence]] + current temporary [[Willpower]]). She may spend her successes on one or more of the following: 1 Success Heal a level of bashing or lethal damage. 1 Success Convert a level of aggravated damage to lethal. 2 Successes Halve the duration (round up) of a poison she suffers from. 3 Successes Cure herself entirely of a disease or [[Derangement]] at Minor intensity. 5 Successes Reduce a disease or [[Derangement]] from Major intensity to Minor. 7 Successes Reduce a disease or [[Derangement]] from Defining intensity to Major. This Charm can only be used once per story.
