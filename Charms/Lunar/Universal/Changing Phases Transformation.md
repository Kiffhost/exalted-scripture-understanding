*The Lunar changes her hybrid form’s nature to embody a new manifestation of physical prowess.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, her player designs an alternate set of Attributes that she uses whenever [[Hybrid Body Transformation]] is active, redistributing up to two dots among [[Stamina]], [[Strength]], and [[Dexterity]]. A Lunar who normally has [[Strength]] 3, [[Dexterity]] 3, [[Stamina]] 3 might shift them to [[Strength]] 3, [[Dexterity]] 5, [[Stamina]] 1 when she takes on her stealthy hybrid form. If this lowers an Attribute below the minimum needed for any of the Lunar’s [[Charms]], she loses access to those [[Charms]] while in hybrid form. Conversely, the Lunar may learn [[Charms]] whose minimums she meets only with her shifted Attributes but can only access them in hybrid form (or if she subsequently raises her true Attributes to meet their minimums). Similarly, she gains [[Excellencies]] if her altered traits qualify for them or loses them if they don’t (p. XX). A Lunar with [[Shifting Beast Nature]] may repurchase this Charm to design a new set of altered Attributes for her second hybrid form.
