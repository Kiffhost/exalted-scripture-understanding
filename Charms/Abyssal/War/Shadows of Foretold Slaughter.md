*Creation itself weeps for the bloodshed to come at the deathknight’s hand, ripping open a shadowland as her dreaded legion takes the field.*
The Abyssal makes a Strategic Maneuver roll with double 7s to make a special Demoralize stratagem with threshold 4. Success also causes a shadowland to open across the battlefield as combat begins. This shadowland doesn’t always linger after the battle’s end, but it’s far more likely than usual.
If the battlefield is already a shadowland or the in Underworld, this stratagem instead enhances allied undead battle groups. Their Might’s bonus dice on attack rolls are converted to automatic successes and add their Might to their Magnitude.
## Special activation rules
When the Abyssal uses Peerless Immortal Strategist, she may use this Charm reflexively, waiving its Willpower cost, to add its stratagem to her options.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through warfare.
