*The Lunar’s skin hardens unto imperviousness against blows that would otherwise pierce the thickest defenses.*
Her soak can’t be reduced, and she can apply it against unsoakable withering damage. If the Lunar is unarmored, she waives this Charm’s [[Initiative]] cost, and it loses the Perilous keyword.
