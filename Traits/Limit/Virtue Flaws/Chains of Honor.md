The Solar is overwhelmed with regret for his past misdeeds, and cleaves to an unbreakable code of honor. He will not tell any lies, including lies of omission or halftruths, nor will he break a promise or sworn oath he has made. If he has deceived anyone in the past, he will strive to find them, tell them the truth, and do whatever he can to atone. Likewise, he will seek out those whom he has broken oaths to, and take on whatever labors or tasks they assign to correct his failure.
[[Chains of Honor]] can be ended prematurely if the Solar is forgiven by someone to whom he has broken an oath or harmed by means of deception.
