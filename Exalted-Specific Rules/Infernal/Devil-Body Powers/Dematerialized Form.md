The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] is naturally dematerialized. She can only be harmed by attacks that
can affect dematerialized characters, and can only be seen by those who can perceive such characters. However, she can’t affect the material world either. To make an attack, make social influence, or otherwise act affect material things, she needs to partially waive her intangibility. Doing so renders her visible and semi-corporeal until the end of her next turn, though attack rolls and [[Awareness]] rolls against her suffer a −3 penalty unless they benefit from magic that can interact with dematerialized beings.
