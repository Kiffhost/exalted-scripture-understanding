*The Lunar’s living projectiles transform, growing flesh-impaling hooks or flying in pursuit of their quarry.*
When she attacks with [[Needle Quill Technique]], her projectile continues to bedevil her enemy, preventing his onslaught penalty from falling below −1. This lasts ([[Essence]]) rounds for withering attacks, or one scene for decisive attacks. The target or an ally at close range can tear out or strike away the projectile with a difficulty 2 gambit, rolled against [[Defense]] (Lunar’s [[Dexterity]]), ending this effect.
