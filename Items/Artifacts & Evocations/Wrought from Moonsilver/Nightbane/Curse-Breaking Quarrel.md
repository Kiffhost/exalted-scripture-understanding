## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by characters resonant with Nightbane. Her arrows wreathed in moonlight, Nightbane’s master burns away vile sorceries and the twisting taint of chaos. She makes a gambit against a character suffering a curse or shaping effect, making a (Dexterity + [lower of Archery or Occult]) attack roll and her Initiative roll against the Essence of the character responsible for that effect. If the curse or shaping wasn’t caused by a character, the Storyteller assigns an appropriate difficulty. Success shatters the curse, or reverses the shaping. If the wielder knows Crimson-and-Silver Rebirth (p. XX), Order-Affirming Blow (Exalted, p. 334), or similar magic capable of undoing shaping effects, successfully negating such an effect while the character responsible is also in the combat causes him to lose one Willpower, which the wielder gains. Outside combat, this Evocation can be used without an Initiative roll.
