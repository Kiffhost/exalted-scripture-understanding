*When a deathknight rides to the slaughter, her mount seethes with a hunger only blood can quell.*
While [[Flesh-Eating Steed Frenzy]] is active, the deathknight’s mount gains one [[Initiative]] at the start of each of its turns. Success on a mounted move action grants her mount (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) [[Initiative]].
With [[Essence]] 4, the mount adds +1 to its base [[Initiative]], maximum 6. This increases to +2 for mounts equivalent to two-dot familiars or +3 for those equivalent to three-dot familiars (Exalted, p. 161)..
