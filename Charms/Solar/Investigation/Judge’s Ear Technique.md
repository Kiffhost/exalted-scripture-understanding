The Lawgiver can evaluate the truth of any statement she hears. This Charm is infallible within limits: if she hears a lie the speaker believes to be true, she won’t detect the untruth. Her sense of lies is keen enough that if a character speaks in half-truths, she’ll know which part of the statement is false. Any magic which contests this effect goes to a roll-off against the Lawgiver’s (Perception + Investigation), with (Essence) automatic successes on the Solar’s roll, and 1s in the opposed roll acting as 10s to the Solar’s result.
