*Breathing in [[Essence]] through every pore of her skin, the stylist becomes all but invincible with Toad Style’s ultimate technique.*
The stylist gains [[Hardness]] ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) and only suffers onslaught penalties from attacks that damage her. Her [[Hardness]] can’t be reduced or bypassed, and damage dice added by magic and other effects aren’t counted when determined if a decisive attack beats her [[Hardness]] — only her attacker’s [[Initiative]]. (If an attack’s damage doesn’t include the attacker’s [[Initiative]], use the lower of his damage dice and his actual [[Initiative]].)
This defense is strongest against poisoned enemies. They subtract the poison’s penalty from their attacks’ effective damage to determine whether it beats her [[Hardness]], and from both withering and decisive damage rolls against her. While crashed, any withering or decisive damage they deal to her is halved, rounded down.
However, this technique has a single flaw. There is one point on the stylist’s body that, when struck, will break this defense. Spotting this weak point requires a ([[Perception]] + [Martial Arts or Medicine]) roll as a miscellaneous action. Its base difficulty is (stylist’s [[Stamina]] + 2), but the stylist’s onslaught penalty subtracts from the difficulty.
Once an enemy spots the weakness, he or one of his allies can strike it with a gambit. The gambit’s difficulty is again (stylist’s [[Stamina]] + 2), reduced by her onslaught.
If successful, this Charm ends.
## Reset 
Once per scene.
## Special activation rules
The stylist can use this Charm reflexively when she enters [[Toad Form]].
## Mastery
Once per scene, the stylist can negate all decisive damage from a single source, even [[uncountable damage]]. She must declare this defense before the attack is rolled. Doing so ends this Charm.
## Terrestrial
The base difficulty of the [[Perception]] roll and gambit to exploit the defense’s weakness are only (stylist’s [[Stamina]]).
