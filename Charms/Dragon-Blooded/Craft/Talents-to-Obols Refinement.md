The Dragon-Blood may exchange her craft points for those of a lower tier: she may convert one white craft point to two gold craft points, or one gold craft point to two silver craft points. Each use can only convert one type of craft points, although thereâ€™s no limit on how many can be exchanged. At [[Essence]] 4, the Exalt may pay one [[Willpower]] when she uses this Charm to convert silver craft points into gold craft points at a four-to-one ratio, although she cannot create white craft points.
