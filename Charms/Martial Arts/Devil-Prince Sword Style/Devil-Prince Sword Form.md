*The Devil-Prince’s intricate, beautiful, and frenetic swordplay are a thing of terror, her graceful blade an abattoir’s cleaver for those caught in her reach.*

The stylist gains the following benefits:
- She doubles up to (Essence) 10s on decisive damage rolls, or up to (Essence + Intimacy) against enemies with [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven intimacies]].
- She adds an automatic success on the attack rolls of distract and disarm gambits. She also gains this bonus on withering attacks against foes with Major or Defining [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven intimacies]].
- She doesn’t suffer onslaught penalties from the attacks of foes with [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven intimacies]]. This doesn’t prevent onslaught penalties inflicted by magic.
- She adds two non-Charm dice on influence rolls to instill [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven intimacies]]. If she succeeds against at least one target, she gains one Initiative.
## Special activation rules
Whenever the stylist deals decisive damage or succeeds on a gambit against an enemy with a [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven Intimacy]], she may reflexively enter this Form. She can also do so when she inflicts a crippling injury against any enemy.
