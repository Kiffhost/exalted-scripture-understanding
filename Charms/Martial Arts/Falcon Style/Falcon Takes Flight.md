*The stylist takes to the air with a powerful leap, executing graceful aerial maneuvers with supreme agility.*
She adds (Martial Arts/2, rounded up) successes on a jumping- or flying-based disengage, rush, or rise from prone action.
Alternatively, immediately after attacking an enemy, she can use a reflexive move action to move away from him without needing to disengage, as long as she moves directly upward. 
## Mastery
If the stylist is moving to higher-elevation terrain, or if sheâ€™s used a reflexive move action to do so that turn, the successes added are non-Charm.
