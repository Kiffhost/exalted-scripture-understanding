*A true warrior sets aside everything but the fight, letting no errant idea stray onto the battlefield. The stylist helps enemies with a strike that unbinds unnecessary thoughts, expelling such beasts of the mind.* 
When she makes a decisive attack against an enemy with a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] of which she’s aware, she rerolls ([[Intimacy]]) failed dice on the damage roll. If she deals at least (his base [[Resolve]]) damage, she expels that [[Intimacy]] from him as a quasi-tangible imp, whose appearance reveals the [[Intimacy]]’s nature and intensity to all witnesses. This is a mental shaping effect (p. XX). The imp is always at the victim’s side, moving with him no matter where he goes. It remains manifest for a scene, during which the victim loses the [[Intimacy|Tie]]’s benefits (but not its negative effects) and halves his base [[Guile]], as the imp betrays whatever he tries to conceal. 
Once per round, the stylist may have the imp grant (lower of [[Intimacy]] or her [[Essence]]) dice of damage to a decisive attack against the victim by any character. The imp can be destroyed with a difficulty ([[Intimacy]]) gambit, but has (stylist’s [[Guile]]) [[Defense]], and requires magic capable of striking dematerialized foes to hit. If it’s destroyed with magic capable of permanently killing spirits, the [[Intimacy]] is weakened one step.
