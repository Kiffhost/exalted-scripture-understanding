*three Martial Arts Charms Bloodying her fists against countless foes, the Abyssal feasts on crimson bounty.*
When the Abyssal deals damage with a decisive attack, she steals (enemy’s wound penalty + 1) motes after damage has been applied, maximum (Dexterity, Stamina, or Strength). If she incapacitates her victim, she steals (his Essence + 3) additional motes, which don’t count toward this limit.
Against grappled enemies, the Abyssal can make a savaging attack, feeding on them with bared fangs. She deals lethal damage and increases the number of motes she can steal to her current rounds of grapple control, if that’s higher.
