*The Lawgiver’s stealth technique is honed until it’s flawless.*
[[Perfect Shadow Stillness]] allows a reroll of any Stealthbased action, preserving the 10s from those results and rerolling the remaining dice. At [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] 5, succeeding at a stealth attempt with this Charm awards the Solar one point of temporary [[Willpower]].
