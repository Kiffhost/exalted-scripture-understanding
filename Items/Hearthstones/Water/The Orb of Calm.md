For four miles around the stone, seas remain relatively calm, rain is never heavy, and winds remain light. Waves never become higher than three yards high and winds are never stronger than 25 miles per hour. This stone only functions if it is within two miles of an ocean or of a lake at least 50 miles across in its smallest dimension. If placed on a ship, seas around the ship remain as a moving zone of calm. The stone does not create doldrums; it merely prevents weather from becoming dangerously powerful.
