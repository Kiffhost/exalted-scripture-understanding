A shimmering doorway of foul water opens, beckoning forth a 20-foot ogre covered in rust-colored chitin and weeping sores, a [[Prince of the Fallen Tower]] sealed away long ago. It’s largely unintelligent, but will obey the sorcerer’s commands faithfully, and forms a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to her that can’t be weakened or altered. If summoned into combat, it rolls [[Join Battle]] immediately. Sorcerers can’t have more than ([[Essence]]) princes summoned at a time. A sorcerer with this as her control spell may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to summon a prince permanently, which doesn’t count against her limit on summoned princes. It counts as her familiar, and gains one Charm (comparable to those below) at each story’s end. She can only have one permanently summoned prince at a time. If it dies, a summoned replacement retains any [[Charms]] gained by its predecessors. Distortion (Goal Number: 7): Distorting the prince causes it to lose its Corrupting Touch Merit and Glory-Blighting Corruption Charm for one scene.
