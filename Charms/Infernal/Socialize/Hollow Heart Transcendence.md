*The Infernal is beyond the fetters of mortal morality, basking in the tribute that virtue pays to vice.*

The Infernal gains an additional point of Willpower and loses one Limit when she upholds a negative Major or Defining Intimacy, but can’t regain Willpower from upholding positive Intimacies. She must spend one Willpower to voluntarily strengthen a positive Intimacy.

Once per day, the Infernal may gain one Willpower when one of the following occurs:
- She harms or humiliates someone that she has a negative Tie toward.
- She catches someone in a lie using [[Witness to Darkness]].
- She senses hypocrisy with [[Naked Wicked Souls]].
