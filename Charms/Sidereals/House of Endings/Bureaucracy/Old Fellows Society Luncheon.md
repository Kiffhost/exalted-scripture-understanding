The Sidereal shrouds herself amid corruption, hunting iniquity in meetings, junkets, business lunches, and after-work drinks. After a few hours or days spent meeting with public officials, merchants, businessmen, and other key players in government or the local business community, the Sidereal secures a position within a government bureau or a business concern. The Storyteller chooses the group, but the Sidereal may specific a broad description, like “a Guild merchant company” or “a government ministry.” Her position has no real duties or responsibilities beyond occasionally showing up and looking busy. Alternatively, she can empower such an position that she already holds. As long as the Sidereal maintains this position and spends significant time attending work-related functions over downtimes, she gains the following benefits: 
-  Group members and members of similar organizations assume she’s just as corrupt as they are. This counts as a Minor Tie. 
-  She gains Backing 2 in that organization. 
-  She waives Excellencies’ mote costs to reduce the target number of Bureaucracy, Lore, and Socialize rolls involving her organization, similar groups, or the subject matter of their official business. 
-  Underling Invisibility Presence applies to group members and members of similar organizations even if they don’t consider themselves her superior; such characters don’t need an Intimacy to resist with Willpower. Reset: Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through bureaucratic or business acumen or by abusing the privileges of one’s office. Reckoners can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
