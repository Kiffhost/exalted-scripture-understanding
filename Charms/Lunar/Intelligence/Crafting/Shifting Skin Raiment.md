*Anointing feathers, fur, or bone with her mutable blood, the Lunar binds animalistic power into a masterpiece.*
Upon creating clothing, armor, jewelry, or another worn object with a major project enhanced by [[Beast-Slayer’s Art]], she can reflexively use [[Sharing Luna’s Gifts]], imbuing the object with up to five dots of mutations reflecting her prey’s nature, paying five gold points per dot. A character wearing this object can spend one [[Willpower]] as a miscellaneous action to gain those mutations for a scene: a feather cloak becomes wings, wolf-fang bracers extend into claws, etc. Though magical, these objects aren’t artifacts; they aren’t indestructible and can’t sustain [[Evocations]]. If this object is bestowed on a character via [[Shining Moon-Child Mark]] (p. XX), he can activate its mutations without spending [[Willpower]].
