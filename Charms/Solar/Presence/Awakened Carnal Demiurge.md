Through intense preparation, the Lawgiver magnifies her own appearance, increasing the magnitude of her presence. The Solar enacts a simple dramatic action lasting five minutes, in which she verbally induces her inner greatness to external form. For as long as she commits Essence, the Solarâ€™s Appearance is increased by one, even if this raises her Appearance above five. In addition, any seduction attempt she makes treats her target as if he had one less Resolve, both lowering his resistance and increasing the effectiveness of her Appearance rating.
