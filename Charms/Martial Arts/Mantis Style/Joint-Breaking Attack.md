Once the mantis catches its prey, there is no escape. While grappling a foe, the stylist savages him with a difficulty 6 gambit that requires no attack roll. Success inflictsasingleleveloflethaldamage,ignoringHardness, and breaks one of the character’s limbs as a crippling injury — the martial artist bends the bone of an arm or leg until it snaps. A broken arm is useless and imposes a −3 penalty on all actions that require two hands to perform, while a broken leg causes a character to treat all ground as difficult terrain. Additionally, the pain of this injury raises that foe’s wound penalty by −2 for the rest of the scene. If not treated with applicable healing magic, the broken bone heals in (7 – victim’s Stamina) months, assuming he receives adequate medical treatment. If the martial artist crashes a grappled enemy with Joint-Locking Technique, she may reflexively activate this Charm to attack with the crippling gambit. 
## Terrestrial

This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by expending three rounds of control over a grapple for this purpose.
