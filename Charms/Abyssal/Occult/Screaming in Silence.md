*The Abyssal’s thoughts echo through death’s darkness, whispers of her own that are heard from afar.*
The Abyssal sends a telepathic message of no more than a few sentences to a chosen target within ([[Essence]] x10) miles. Messages sent with this Charm cannot be overheard or intercepted without magic.
Even then, such magic must overcome a difficulty of (Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + [[Occult]]), with 1s subtracting successes.
The Abyssal may conceal her identity from the recipient. He may attempt a read intentions roll against her to discern her identity, but it fails automatically unless enhanced by magic. Even then, his 1s subtract successes.
With [[Occult]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use this Charm with unlimited range.
[[Whispers]]: If the Abyssal sends a message to another character with [[Whispers]], they may respond as above. She can also invoke [[Whispers]] instead of paying [[Willpower]] for this Charm’s [[Essence]] 3 effect.
