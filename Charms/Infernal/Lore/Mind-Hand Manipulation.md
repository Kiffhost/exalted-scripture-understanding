*The Infernal needs nothing so crude as her hands to impose order on the world, wielding tendrils of mental force that trail white light and ripples of spatial distortion.*

The Infernal can telekinetically manipulate things within short range, with the following effects:
- She can take physical actions through these mental limbs, using Wits instead of Dexterity and Intelligence instead of Strength. This includes determining the raw damage of withering attacks and whether she meets the minimum Strength to attempt a feat of strength. However, she suffers a −3 penalty on all actions that involve fine manipulation, including attacks with telekinetically-wielded weapons.
- She can make telekinetic attacks with (Wits + Lore). They have +4 Accuracy, Damage (Willpower + 2), and Overwhelming (Essence). Their damage doesn’t include her Strength. Decisive attacks can deal either bashing or lethal damage, either exerting crushing force or focusing her telekinesis to a scalpel-sharp edge. If she makes a grapple gambit, she rolls (Intelligence + Lore) for the control roll, but can’t grapple enemies beyond close range.
- She can also block attacks telekinetically, with Parry ({Wits +Lore} / 2, rounded up).
- She can hold up to (higher of Essence or 3) objects in mid-air with telekinetic force, in addition to any objects she's actively using as part of an action. They can be struck from the air with a disarm gambit. Levitating an object this way is reflexive, but can only be done on the Infernal’s turn.

The Infernal’s mental tendrils are clearly visible when in use, making it clear that she is the source of her telekinetic actions.
## [[Keys]]
#### Precision Thought-Force Exercise
The Infernal doubles 9s on telekinetic actions, excluding attacks. However, this isn’t compatible with Charms from the Ability that’s normally used for that action, if they could ordinarily be used through telekinesis.
#### Psychic Surge Exertion (4m)
The Infernal can pay four motes to add (Willpower/2, rounded up) to her effective Strength for a feat of strength or withering attack roll.
#### Tool-Transcending Constructs
The Infernal’s telekinetic force can be used in place of any mundane equipment that might be needed for a task. She could mentally assemble an intricate clockwork mechanism, open a surgical incision with a psychical scalpel, or play a percussive rhythm by striking the air with psychic force. She doesn’t suffer a penalty on actions that require fine manipulation as long as she relies solely on telekinesis.
#### Unseen Force Application (Essence 2)
The Infernal can render her telekinetic force invisible when she pleases.
#### Focused Psyche Projection (Lore 5, Essence 2, [[#Precision Thought-Force Exercise]])
The Infernal’s telekinesis extends out to medium range.
#### Specimen Retrieval Modus (Lore 5, Essence 2, [[#Psychic Surge Exertion (4m)|Psychic Surge Exertion]])
The Infernal can grapple enemies at this Charm’s full range, dragging them into close range on a successful gambit. She doesn’t suffer any of the usual penalties for grappling.
#### Force-Draining Exigence (Lore 5, Essence 3, [[#Precision Thought-Force Exercise]])
If the Infernal deals 3+ levels of damage with a decisive attack, she can siphon her target’s Essence, forgoing levels of damage to steal three motes per level from her target. She must still deal at least one level of damage.
#### Will-Crushing Force ([[#Force-Draining Exigence (Lore 5, Essence 3, Precision Thought-Force Exercise )|Force-Draining Exigence]]) (3m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay three motes, one Willpower when she uses [[#Force-Draining Exigence (Lore 5, Essence 3, Precision Thought-Force Exercise )|Force-Draining Exigence]], waiving all levels of damage but one and causing her target to lose that many points of Willpower instead of motes. (She doesn’t need to pay until after the damage roll). If this leaves her victim with zero Willpower, he’s crashed, setting him to 0 Initiative. If he was already crashed — or if he’s a mortal — he’s instead incapacitated, forced into comatose unconsciousness.
