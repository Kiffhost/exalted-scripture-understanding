Violence is a brutish and ugly thing, a truth the Sidereal imparts through bruises and broken bones. If the Sidereal deals 3+ levels of decisive damage or any aggravated damage, or if her target accepts a crippling injury, she inflicts a prominent and unsightly wound — a black eye, a broken nose, patches of torn-out hair, etc. Her victim becomes [[Hideous]] (Exalted, p. 162) and suffers a −3 penalty on [[Appearance]]- and [[Charisma]]-based actions other than threaten rolls. This crippling effect lasts until he’s healed all levels of damage he suffers from. 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal may use this Charm reflexively when a character within close range makes an [[Appearance]] or [[Charisma]] roll against her, rolling a decisive attack that benefits as above before he makes his roll. (Roll [[Join Battle]] if necessary).
