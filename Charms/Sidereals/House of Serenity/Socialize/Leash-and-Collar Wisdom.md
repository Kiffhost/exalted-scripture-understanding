*The more the Sidereal’s master thinks he can control her, the more vulnerable he is to her honeyed words.*
When someone who holds a position of superiority over the Sidereal or who has a Tie of romantic or sexual desire toward her is about to ignore her advice or act against such a Tie, she can use this Charm to make a special (Manipulation + Socialize) persuade roll. If successful, her target must enter a Decision Point and pay one Willpower to proceed with the action. If he doesn’t, he must abandon the attempt, and can’t retry it that scene.
Once per story, when the Sidereal uses this Charm to prevent someone from acting in opposition to destiny, she succeeds without needing to roll.
## Special activation rules
If the Sidereal fails and her target’s action lets her curse him with a Descending (Caste) Horoscope, she waives its Willpower cost.
## Reset
Once per scene.
