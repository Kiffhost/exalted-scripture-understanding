*Striking at the pattern of her foe’s Essence, the stylist impedes and redirects its flow.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have Initiative 10+.
If a decisive attack deals at least 3+ damage, she may forgo one level of damage to negate one of her target’s ongoing magical effects. This doesn’t affect Permanent Charms. Against enemies with higher Essence, she must forgo two levels of damage.
This Charm can also enhance a grapple control roll. If the stylist succeeds, she can forgo (enemy’s Essence) rounds of control to negate one of his ongoing effects.
She must have at least one round of control left over after paying the cost to do so.
