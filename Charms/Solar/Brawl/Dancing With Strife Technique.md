Empowered by violence, the Solar exults at the song of death in her ears. Once per scene, if the Exalt successfully defends against an attack that rolls (Solar’s Essence or five, whichever is greater) or more successes, she may use this Charm to gain one point of temporary Willpower. This Charm can be reset by defending against a withering attack when the Exalt has only one Initiative.
