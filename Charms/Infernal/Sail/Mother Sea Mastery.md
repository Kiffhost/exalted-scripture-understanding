*The Infernal is a creature of stormy seas and lightless ocean depths, her soul baptized in the Demon Sea’s waters.*

The Infernal’s body takes on subtle aspects of the Demon Sea’s monstrosities, granting the following benefits:
- She can speak aloud while submerged, her voice carrying as clearly as if through air.
- She ignores up to (Sail/2, rounded up) points of any penalties she suffers for acting while underwater.
- She adds (Sail/2, rounded up) to her effective Stamina to determine how long she can hold her breath while underwater.
- She adds one die on Sail rolls, Survival rolls related to waterways and aquatic life, Athletics rolls for swimming, and Resistance rolls against aquatic environmental hazards. With Sail 5, she adds an automatic success instead.
