*As killing momentum winds itself around the tip of her blade, the Solar sees a perfect opening and strikes, hurling it with a streak of scarlet anima.*
When the Solar successfully misdirects an opponent with ObserverDeceiving [[Attack]], she can use this Charm to make an immediate decisive attack against that opponent, striking as if from ambush (p. 203). She may only attack a single opponent with [[Crimson Razor Wind]], even if she deceives more than one target with her throw. Using [[Crimson Razor Wind]] does not break the Solarâ€™s concealment.
