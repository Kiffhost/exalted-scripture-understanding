*The necromancer wreathes a kingdom in shadow and vapor, transforming the land itself as either terrible curse or the darkest of blessings.*
The spell unfurls over the course of five hours, as mist encircles the region to be transformed, which extends out up to ([[Essence]]) miles in all directions from the necromancer at the epicenter of the magic.
Recognizing the spell’s work in progress requires a difficulty 6 ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll; success reveals that the spell may be stopped by breaking the necromancer’s concentration.
If the spell is allowed to play out to its conclusion, the mist-robed region is reshaped in the necromancer’s image. She may choose three region properties to impose upon it, whether physical changes (“walls of thorns and razors”), emotional tenors (“mournful regret”), or laws (“none here dare lie”). These properties must draw from the themes of death, the Underworld, the Neverborn, or the Old Laws.
- Physical properties may create difficult terrain or mundane environmental hazards throughout the region, with the exact distribution determined by the [[Storyteller]] according to the necromancer’s intent.
- Emotional properties inflict a −2 penalty to [[Resolve]] when leveraged through influence, and anyone who’s spent at least a night and a day within treats the feeling as a Minor [[Intimacy]].
- Laws are metaphysically enforced, inflicting a −3 penalty on attempts to break them or to conceal evidence of having broken them.
Although the region doesn’t become a true shadowland, it is cast into a perpetual gloam. Sunlight doesn’t harm the dead or their grave goods, and roving bands of wild hungry ghosts and zombies rise unbidden every night. They have a Major Tie of loyalty to the necromancer and intuit the purpose of the spell — a kingdom plunged into this nightmare as punishment is haunted by these restless dead, but loyal citizens of a death-touched land may pass undaunted.
The spell always creates a fulcrum at the point of its original casting — a whirlpool of churning dust, an ivory tree with knotted limbs, a throne of grave-cold ice. It can be destroyed as a difficulty 7 feat of demolition, requiring [[Strength]] 5+; this breaks the spell.
## Control
The necromancer may shape the spell’s fulcrum into a crown, ring, or other personal trinket which she carries with her for safekeeping. When she sleeps, her nightmares wreathe the world in mist, enforcing one of the properties of her choice from a cursed land whose fulcrum she carries. These changes extend out to long range of her, and remain until the location is cleansed as a difficulty 5 ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) ritual.
## Distortion (25)
One of the region’s properties is suppressed, falling into abeyance. The distorting necromancer intuits the distance, direction, and general path towards the spell’s fulcrum, and lowers the difficulty of feats to break it by two.
