*The Infernal casts her weapons skyward, slashing open rifts that overflow with the Endless Desert’s sands.*

The Infernal causes silvery sands to pour down in an area extending out to medium range. This inflicts a −1 penalty on vision-based rolls and is an environmental hazard with difficulty (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) and Damage 1L/round. This increases to 2A/round against gods. The Infernal and any allied demons or Infernals aren’t affected by this.

The Infernal doesn’t need to aim to attack enemies at medium range or further if they’re within the sand. When she attacks an enemy in the sands whose Initiative is lower than hers, it becomes a surprise attack and she converts dice from aiming to automatic successes. She gains these benefits against gods regardless of Initiative.

If the Infernal uses [[Scorpion-Tailed Mirage]] within the sands, she only needs to pay the cost of non-Excellency Charms once to enhance all attacks as long as she only attacks enemies within the sands.
