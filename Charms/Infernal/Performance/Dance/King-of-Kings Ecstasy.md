*The Infernal’s dance is glorious beyond imagining, following the steps of the first dancer.*

The Infernal makes a ({Appearance or Charisma} + Performance) inspire roll through dance, adding (Anima) dice if her anima banner is visible. A successful roll also instils affected characters with a Tie of awe toward the Infernal. The Tie’s context may vary depending on the emotion the Infernal evokes — if she inspires fear, it might be a Tie of terrified awe. The Tie’s Resolve penalty applies when determining how many dice the Infernal’s Appearance adds on influence rolls with any Ability against an affected character. This lasts until he goes (Infernal’s Essence) hours without interacting with her.

Affected characters’ players still choose how they respond to the inspired emotion, but they must do so in a way that fits the instilled Tie. This often involves trying to catch the Infernal’s attention, find a chance to meet her, or learn more about her.
