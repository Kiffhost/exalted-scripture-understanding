*Even stone and metal bleed from the wounds gouged into them by the Scar.*

The wielder can pay a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Melt the Blade, Pit the Armor, or Scar the Pillar to curse a damaged object, causing it to continuously drip acid for the rest of the scene. Anyone touching or holding it is exposed to an environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 3L/round. As a small grace, characters trapped in acid-eaten armor can easily remove it as it dissolves, requiring only a single miscellaneous action, or two miscellaneous actions for heavy armor.
### Dissonant
This can only be used once per scene.
