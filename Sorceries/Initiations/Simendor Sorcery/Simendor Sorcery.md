*In a time now lost to history, House Simendor's ancestors cavorted with spirits of sand and shadow in the open desert - rogue gods and elementals who refused to bow to the Old Realm.*
From this so-called Court of Nameless Gods, they learned the art of [[sorcery]]. Today, many scions still honor their house's traditions by initiating into [[sorcery]] under these spirits' tutelage, seeking out their hidden pleasure-sanctums.
