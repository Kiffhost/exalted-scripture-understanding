*The Abyssalâ€™s exquisite performance shapes the world into her weapon.*
The Abyssal unleashes terrifying apparitions: heart-stopping screams, razor-sharp dancing shadows, swarming wraiths, or the like. This isa one-time environmental hazard, centered on a point within medium range and extending out to short range from it. It has difficulty (highest social Attribute) and Damage (higher of [[Essence]] or 3)L.
If the Abyssal uses [[Grotesque Phantasmagoria]] in multiple consecutive rounds, she adds +1 to its Damage each time, maximum ([[Essence]] + 4) .
## Special activation rules
This Charm can be flurried with a [[Performance]] roll or an action to continue a performance.
