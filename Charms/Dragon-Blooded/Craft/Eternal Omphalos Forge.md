The Dragon-Blood feels the world turn on its axis as she labors over the forge, affirming her will and genius with every fall of her hammer as she shapes a world-shaking treasure. She begins a superior or legendary project, adding one to the projectâ€™s terminus. If the Exalt completes the project before its terminus has elapsed, she gains one point of Willpower for each unused interval, in addition to her normal craft point reward. This can raise her above her permanent Willpower. This Charm can only be used once per story. The Exalt may reset it by spending five white points.
