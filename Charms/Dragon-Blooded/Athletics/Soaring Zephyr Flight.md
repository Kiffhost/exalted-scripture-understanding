Outracing even herself, the Dragon-Blood surpasses the bounds of gravity. She moves two range bands upwards with a mighty leap, hovering in place at the apex of her jump. She can subsequently fly through the air with her normal movement actions, moving vertically or horizontally, and hover in place while not moving. In combat, each round after the first that she maintains this Charm, she must pay four Initiative to remain in the air. This Charm ends if sheâ€™s crashed or incapacitated, leaves Air Aura, or ends her mote commitment, causing her to drift harmlessly to the ground.
