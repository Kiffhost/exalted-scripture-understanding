The Solarâ€™s glory burns like the very sun in the sky. When her anima is at the glowing or burning level, her Presencebased attempts to threaten, persuade, or instill gain one non-Charm automatic success. When she is at bonfire, these actions gain an additional extra non-Charm die as well. The Solar is glorious and terrible; this power does not aid seduction attempts unless the Exalt channels her glory into amplifying her magnificence with a stunt, using her Appearance on the roll. This Charm never aids a bargain action.
