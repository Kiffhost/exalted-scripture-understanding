*The Abyssal binds the souls of her slain to her blade, denying them the reprieve of Lethe and oblivion alike.*
When the Abyssal fatally incapacitates a living character or permanently destroys a spirit with a decisive attack, she can use this Charm to draw his soul into her weapon, gaining (victim’s [[Essence]] +3) motes as she feeds on it. If she uses this Charm multiple times in a scene, the mote rewards of subsequent uses are halved, rounded up.
Imprisoned souls can’t communicate coherently, but the Abyssal can use [[Corpse-Questioning Technique]] and similar magic to interact with them. Even without such magic, she can draw on bound souls’ knowledge to provide tutelage in their areas of expertise, dividing the training time necessary for appropriate traits by at least ([[Essence]] + 1). She also gains this benefit when awakening [[Evocations]] from an artifact weapon that a soul’s been bound in.
The Abyssal can only have up to ([[Essence]]) souls bound at a time. She can free them as she wishes.
They’re also set free if the weapon they’re imprisoned in is destroyed. At the Storyteller’s discretion, other magic may be capable of freeing them, particularly [[Occult]] [[Charms]].
