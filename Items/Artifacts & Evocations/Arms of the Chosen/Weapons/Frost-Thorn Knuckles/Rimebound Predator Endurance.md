Drawing on a hunting beast’s tenacity, the wielder numbs herself to cold and pain. She ignores penalties or environmental hazards resulting from severe cold, and adds +(Survival) to her base soak if unarmored. If she has Survival 4+ or a Survival specialty that relates to frigid environs, she also ignores one point of wound penalty. 

## Resonant

At Essence 2, this Evocation’s duration is extended to one hour. If the wielder renews it at the end of the hour, she waives its Willpower cost.
