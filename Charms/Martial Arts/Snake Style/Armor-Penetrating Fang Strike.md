*Essence hardens the Snake stylist’s fingers into fangs capable of piercing through steel.*
The [[Armor-Penetrating Fang Strike]] allows a withering attack to ignore all of an enemy’s soak from armor, or a decisive attack to ignore (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) hardness. 
## Terrestrial Reset
A Dragon-Blood may only use this Charm once per scene, unless she resets it by dealing 3+ levels of damage with a Snake style decisive attack and then builds back up to [[Initiative]] 12+.
