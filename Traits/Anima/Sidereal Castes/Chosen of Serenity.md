When Venus laughs, all the world’s suffering seems worth it; when she weeps, all joy dies. The Maiden of Serenity oversees all forms of relationships and societies, and her Joybringers ensure that these unfold in accordance with Heaven’s agenda. Artists, diplomats, intriguers, artificers, and tempters, they undertake the delicate work of weaving the fates of those with free will. They unite or separate starcrossed lovers, bring peace in times of conflict, play kingmaker in matters of politics and commerce, shape societies, and safeguard Creation’s peoples from suffering and sorrow.

In the First Age, Joybringers safeguarded Creation’s peace and prosperity against threats from within and without. They negotiated treaties among warring Exalted, led efforts to rebuild in the aftermath of cataclysm, and mended the damage done to Creation by otherworldly incursions. As Heaven’s Envoys, they negotiated with otherworldly courts in Yu-Shan’s name, negotiating the Seven-Limbed Pact, the Dispensation of Verumpira, and the Black Moon Accords that brought peace with the devil-stars. And, as friends, advisors, matchmakers, and muses, they counseled the Chosen in their personal lives, helping bring together auspicious pairings of Exalted in sacred marriages and other relationships.

Venus’ Chosen face many trials in the Age of Sorrows, wrestling with a world riven by chaos and strife so that destinies of peace, joy, and tranquility might come to pass. Arcane fate and the bitter schism left by the Solar Purge have thwarted any hopes of counseling fellow Chosen as companions and confidantes; instead, today’s Joybringers guide and manipulate mortal queens, worldly spirits, merchant princes, and others through whom they can shape the course of politics, culture, and commerce. Fate’s enemies have scarred the world beyond repair, but still Heaven’s Envoys seek to mend what can be salvaged and offer what solace there is to give.

Destined Joybringers’ mortal lives play out among vibrant webs of relationships. Some were born into urban metropoli or other densely populated regions; others grew up among smaller but closely-knit communities, whether rustic villages or secluded monasteries. Some sought to bring joy to others — artists and artisans, people-pleasers, those who make great sacrifices for their children or their people. Others sought life’s pleasures for themselves as rakes, social climbers, or merchants. Not all tend toward extraversion; reclusive poets, eremitic philosophers, and perpetually preoccupied craftsmen have all won Venus’ favor.

# Auspicious Prospects
## Auspicious Prospects for Serenity

The Joybringer may pay one mote to learn whether an interpersonal relationship or someone’s happiness would align with destiny. 

## Lesser Sign of Venus

The Joybringer may pay five motes to reflexively make Venus’ lesser sign in a flourish of cerulean stardust. Until her next turn, she and all allies within close range add (her [[Essence]], maximum 5) non-Charm dice on influence rolls involving positive emotions and [[Craft]] rolls for basic and major projects. [[Resolve]] bonuses from their positive Ties increase by one. This is free at bonfire. 

## Greater Sign of Venus

Once per story, the Joybringer may pay twenty motes and one [[Willpower]] to make Venus’ greater sign, illuminating the battlefield with a sapphire light. This takes her entire turn. All participants in the battle stand down, as a Psyche effect that lasts ([[Essence]]) days. If someone wants to reinitiate hostilities, he must enter a Decision Point and cite a Defining [[Intimacy]] to spend (higher of Sidereal’s [[Essence]] or 3) [[Willpower]]. This doesn’t apply to attacking characters not involved in the original battle, nor does it apply to fighting back in self-defense.
