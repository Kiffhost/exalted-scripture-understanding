*When the Dragon-Blood places potentially harmful food or drink in her mouth, she may roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) to detect poison or other harmful ingredients.*
Most common poisons are difficulty 1-3 to detect, while an odorless or tasteless poison would be difficulty 4-5. Successfully identifying the danger immediately ignites the offending item in the Terrestrialâ€™s mouth, letting her spit it out before it can harm her. With [[Awareness]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, if detecting a poison causes the Dragon-Blood to roll [[Join Battle]] against a foe she believed poisoned her, she adds any threshold successes from her ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll as non-Charm dice on her [[Join Battle]] roll.
