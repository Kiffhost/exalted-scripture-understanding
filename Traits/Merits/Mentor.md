Another individual of greater experience regularly teaches and advises the character. Mentors may provide advice, assistance, and even training in mundane or magical fields.
A one-dot mentor is an expert within a particular noteworthy field, such as languages, swordplay, sorcery, or martial arts. A two-dot mentor is an expert in several notable fields, and may be an individual of notable power or influence. A three-dot mentor is a master of many things, as well as a significant regional power or universally respected authority in his areas of expertise.

#### Lunar
Pact Lunars often have a shahan-ya as a three-dot Mentor. In games where all players are students of one shahan-ya, the Storyteller might give them this Merit for free.

#### Sidereal
Experienced Sidereals are three-dot Mentors. Senior gods of the Celestial Bureaucracy are usually two- or three-dot Mentors.
