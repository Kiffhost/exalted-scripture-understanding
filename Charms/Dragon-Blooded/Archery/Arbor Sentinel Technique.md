As the Dragon-Blood lowers her bow to the ground, its once-living wood remembers what it once was, sprouting roots that dive into the soil. In a matter of seconds, the weapon grows into a small tree, less than a range band high, its branches replete with arrows. It’s still perfectly curved and weighted to allow the Dragon-Blood to attack with it, provides her with the benefits of heavy cover (Exalted, p. 199), and cannot be disarmed. It provides a never-ending supply of ammunition, ensuring she won’t run out of arrows even in a daylong battle. However, she cannot move the weapon in its tree form, and this Charm ends if she moves further than close range from it.
