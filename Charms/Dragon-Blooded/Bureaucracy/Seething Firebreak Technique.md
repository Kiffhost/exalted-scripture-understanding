The Dragon-Blood fans the flames of dissent and unrest within her own organization, forcing traitors and conspiracies out into the open. She makes passionate speeches, spreads propaganda, or carries out strict disciplinary measures, rolling (Charisma + Bureaucracy) with double 9s. Any member of the organization whose Resolve is beaten is suffused with Fire Essence. For loyal members, this manifests as a passionate enjoyment of their work. Conversely, members who plan to betray the organization or conspire against its leadership experience intense passion surrounding their dissent. They’re unable to take covert or stealthy action against the group, its membership, or its leaders — instead, their passions drive them to be open, overt, and honest. They can enter a Decision Point and call on a Defining Intimacy that justifies discretion to pay one Willpower to resist for the rest of the story. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by completing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) through bureaucratic means.
