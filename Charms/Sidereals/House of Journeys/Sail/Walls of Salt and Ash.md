*The Sidereal traces the Lesser Sign of the Captain on a ship’s prow in glimmering yellow stardust, warding it against the direst perils of otherworldly seas.*
Hostile enemies of fate cannot willingly come aboard the warded ship unless their [[Essence]] exceeds the Sidereal’s or they spend one [[Willpower]]. Un-Exalted enemies of fate suffer +1 target number on rolls aboard it.
