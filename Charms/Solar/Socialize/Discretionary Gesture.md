Through a sharp movement, a pointed glance, a whisper or a command to silence, the Lawgiver can raise the [[Guile]] of another. When the Solar perceives an ally being targeted by a [[Guile]]-piercing effect, she may use this Charm to reflexively raise his [[Guile]]. This Charm is facilitated by the urgency of the Lawgiver’s stunt: if she glares or makes a cutting gesture, her ally’s [[Guile]] is raised by a single point. If she distracts him from speaking through means both dubious and clever, his [[Guile]] is raised by two. If she slaps him full on in the face, his [[Guile]] is raised by three.
