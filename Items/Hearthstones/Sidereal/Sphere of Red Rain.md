Appearing as a black gem shot through with countless tiny red flaws, this hearthstone has a four mote attunement cost, and grants the Exalt knowledge of the next combat Charm for which she qualifies. Note that she cannot naturally proceed to learn the next Charm in the tree using this hearthstoneâ€™s Charm as a prerequisite. She must first complete any requisite training required and learn the Charm with her own experience points in order to advance to the next Charm.
