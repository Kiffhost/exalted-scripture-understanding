*The Infernal proclaims her dominion over all the world’s waters, exulting in the empowering hosannas of the Primordial waters.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must be surrounded by a body of liquid or aboard a ship, invoking a transformation that extends out to medium range from her or out to short ranger from her ship. Motes of sickly yellow-green phosphorescence rise up from the water’s surface like fireflies, while the enormous shadows of nightmarish leviathans can be seen in its depths. Any mundane storms or wind within this area are stilled.

As long as the Infernal is within the transformed area, she gains the following benefits:
- At the start of each of her turns, she gains one mote and one Initiative unless she’s crashed. In naval combat, she also gains one Momentum.
- She doubles 8s on Sail rolls — including attack rolls for [[Ichor Flux Tendrils]].
- She can summon creatures instantly with [[What Lurks Beneath]] can summon creatures instantly.
- She adds (Wits) to the raw damage and Overwhelming of withering attacks with [[Ichor Flux Tendrils]] and doubles 10s on their decisive damage rolls.
- If she’s underwater and at least four range bands below the surface, she can enter her [[Devil-Body]] without needing to meet its trigger. This is still subject to the once-per-story limit.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Demonic Fog Shroud]], [[Ichor Flux Tendrils]], and [[Tainted Tide Malison]] reflexively with this Charm, waiving up to (higher of Essence or 3) points of Willpower costs, including surcharges from [[Keys]].
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she enters her [[Devil-Body]].
