Standing unseen in the midst of her enemies, the Exalt revels in her control of battleâ€™s flow. Once per scene, while concealed during combat, the Exalt may roll [[Join Battle]] and add her result to her current [[Initiative]], so long as she has landed at least one decisive attack. Any [[Charms]] the Exalt uses to enhance her roll are automatically muted.
