*Wreathing herself in Mars’ wrath, the Sidereal cows her inferiors in the Celestial Bureaucracy.*
When the Sidereal makes an influence roll against a god to threaten him, instill a Tie of fear, or persuade him based on a Tie of fear, the Willpower cost to resist is increased by one. If her target has Ties of fear toward a superior within the Celestial Bureaucracy or to the Five Maidens, it supports this influence as though the Sidereal were its object. She can also use this Charm against other un-Exalted characters officially employed by the Celestial Bureaucracy.
