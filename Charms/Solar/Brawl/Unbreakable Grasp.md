The Solar tightens her [[Essence]] around her limbs, making it nearly impossible to pry her off her opponent. The Exalt may use this Charm when her clinch control is threatened by incoming attacks (see p. 200), paying two motes for every round of control preserved. These motes are paid after the opponentâ€™s attack and damage rolls as needed.
