*The necromancer bites her cheek until blood flows thick in her mouth, enticing her lower soul to leap forth from her body with a hundredfold strength.*
The necromancer exhales a cloud of blue fog and tendrils that takes the form of a [[battle group]] of hungry ghosts (Exalted, p. 503) that resemble her. The [[battle group]] appears within close [[range]] of the necromancer and immediately begins attacking her enemies. It has [[Size]] (1 + the necromancer’s [[Health Track#wound penalties|wound penalty]], maximum 3), elite [[Drill]], and [[Might]] 2, and has the necromancer’s [[Willpower]] score. All slain hungry ghosts dissolve into a blue mist floating about the battlefield. At the scene’s end, they all disperse into the mist and flow back into the necromancer’s mouth.
The necromancer can use the following powers while this spell is active:
Devouring Entrails Formation (5m; Simple; Until the engage action ends): The necromancer focuses her ire towards a single target to be devoured by her horde. This uses the [[battle group]]’s turn to take a special engage action (Exalted, p. 209) that costs no [[Initiative]] to seize and ravage the chosen enemy. The [[battle group]] gains double 10s on [[Grappling#Savage|savaging]] attacks and may take [[Grappling#Restrain/Drag|restrain]] actions. Once per scene.
Infinite Hunger Reconstitution (8m, 1wp; Simple; Instant): The necromancer may restore her swarm of hungry ghosts from the blue fog. This is a special [[rally for numbers]] action using ([[Stamina]] + [[Occult]]), with each success restoring one point of [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]]. If this fills the [[battle group]]’s [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] track, it may restore a point of [[Size]], up to the [[Size]] it possessed when first summoned. Once per scene, unless reset when the [[battle group]] kills a nontrivial opponent.
Soul-Horde Synchronicity (5m; Reflexive; Instant): The necromancer may guide her lower soul’s manifold actions with her mind, letting her roll [[command]] actions with ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) and flurry them at no penalty.
## Reset 
Once per scene.
## Control
The necromancer gains a unique rapport with hungry ghosts, who are treated as having a Minor Tie of kinship to the necromancer. Hungry ghosts with a lower [[Essence]] score will not attack her unless compelled through magic, and those with an [[Essence]] score equal to or greater than the necromancer must spend a [[Willpower]] to attack her. The necromancer’s blood possesses an uncanny blue tint when spilled, tendrils writhing beneath its surface.
## Distortion (8)
Distortion immediately reduces the battle group’s [[Drill]] to average and [[Might]] to 1, weakening the strength of the horde’s coordination.
