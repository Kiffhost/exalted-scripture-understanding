*Hollowing bones or sleeking her body, the Lunar refines her shape for unmatched speed.*
The Lunar rerolls 1s until they cease to appear on opposed movement rolls or rolls involved in a race or similar contest of speed. For each die that’s rerolled into a success in combat, she gains either one [[Initiative]], or a non-Charm bonus die on the next interval’s roll in a race.
Outside of combat, the Lunar can move at ({Dexterity + Stamina} x5) miles per hour over open terrain. This is compatible with all forms of movement under her own power.
If the Lunar reactivates this Charm at the end of its duration, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost.

## Protean 
In animal shapes capable of moving faster than this Charm’s speed, the Lunar instead increases their overland speeds by ({Dexterity + Stamina} x2) miles per hour and can maintain their top speed indefinitely.
