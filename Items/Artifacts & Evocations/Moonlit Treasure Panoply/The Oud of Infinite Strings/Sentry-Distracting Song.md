Ignore the breaking glass and the barking guard dogs — listen to the oud’s sweet song.
While performing with one of the oud’s [[Evocations]], the musician can use her song to cover up a specific sound or noise: the ringing of blade against blade, a person’s voice, birdsong in a forest, etc. This costs two motes per round in combat or per minute outside of it. It affects sounds within long range of the musician, or ([[Essence]] + [[Manipulation]]) range while using [[Infinite Strings Reverberation]]. The musician can begin doing so in the middle of a performance — no hecklers allowed.
Nontrivial characters can attempt a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll with a minimum difficulty of 7 to hear the hidden sound if doing so helps them protect or support a Defining [[Intimacy]]. They can also do so if they have superhuman hearing or magic that specifically enhances hearing-based rolls. This is easier if the sound’s source is in plain view to a listener — no [[Intimacy]] or enhanced hearing is necessary to roll, and the minimum difficulty is 4.
A nontrivial character silenced by the song can pay one [[Willpower]] to be heard over the song if doing so supports one of his Major or Defining Intimacies. This lasts for around ten seconds of speech or one influence roll.
The musician can drown out up to ([[Manipulation]]) different sounds, paying this Evocation’s cost separately for each.
## Dissonant
The musician must pay one [[Willpower]] the first time she uses this Evocation in a scene.
