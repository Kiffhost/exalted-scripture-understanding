*The Sidereal exudes mysterious desirability, drawing eyes and snaring hearts with a deft hand on the strands of fate.*
When the Sidereal makes a persuade or bargain roll with any Ability, she can treat any positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] her target has toward her as a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of romantic or sexual desire. If a character is of incompatible sexual orientation with the Sidereal, she instead treats his [[Intimacy|Tie]] as one of fascination.
