*The Infernal’s forge is stoked with sacrifice, imbuing her works with her victims’ agonies.*

The Infernal refines her art through the ritual execution of a victim during a [[Basic Project|basic]] or [[Major Project|major project]], whether to supply raw materials or as a test of a work in progress (Exalted, p. 240). Doing so adds (victim’s Essence) dice on each roll for a project. The Infernal adds (higher of applicable Craft or victim’s Essence) to the silver points awarded by a basic project. On [[Major Project|major projects]], she subtracts the same amount from the silver point cost for the first roll. The sacrifice can’t be a trivial character.

With Craft 5, Essence 3, the Infernal can enhance [[Superior Project|superior projects]] with the sacrifice of a supernatural being, reducing the first roll’s gold point cost by (victim’s Essence). If the victim is a celestial god or an Exalt, the cost is reduced by an additional point.
