Arrayed in totems and fetishes that mark her triumph over countless spirits, the Lunar shaman draws on their puissance to work miracles and empower acolytes. After exorcising a spirit of equal or lesser [[Essence]] with [[Ghost-Banishing Howl]], she traps it in a mundane object on her person, imprisoning it until that object is destroyed. Such talismans become supernaturally durable; destroying one requires, at minimum, a [[Strength]] 5 feat of demolition at difficulty (Lunar’s [[Essence]] + [[Intelligence]]). If she crafted the talisman, she gains (higher of spirit’s [[Essence]] or 3) gold points. If the Lunar commits three motes when using this Charm, she chooses one of the spirit’s [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]] — or, if it has none, works with the Storyteller to design an [[Eclipse]] Charm appropriate for the spirit. The talisman’s wielder may use this Charm if he meets its prerequisites. If the Lunar has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward a character, she can pay one [[Willpower]] to let him use a Charm whose prerequisites he doesn’t meet, as long as she meets them. If he lacks a mote pool, she may also pay any mote costs on his behalf. She becomes aware whenever a talisman bearer would benefit from such intervention, regardless of distance. If the Lunar ends her mote commitment, the talisman no longer offers this benefit, though the spirit remains imprisoned, and she may commit these motes anew to restore the Charm. She can’t commit motes to more than ([[Essence]]) talismans at a time. 

## Special activation rules

When the Lunar incapacitates a spirit of any [[Essence]] rating with DemonDrinking Fang (p. XX), she may pay one [[Willpower]] to imprison it with this Charm rather than destroying it.
