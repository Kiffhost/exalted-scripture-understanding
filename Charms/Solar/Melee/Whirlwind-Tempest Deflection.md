*Even a world-consuming maelstrom is driven aside by a Solar’s defense.*
Brandishing her [[Essence]]-laden weapon, when the Solar successfully parries a decisive attack of 17+ base damage, she may use this Charm to redirect the damage in a shockwave that cuts a circle of destruction around herself. This attack automatically damages or destroys any non-magical scenery in range, doing automatic damage equal to half the decisive attack (rounded down). Done in a temple, pillars will begin to slide off of their bases. Done in a forest, trees will begin to topple all around the Solar. This attack also automatically hits every trivial opponent in close range, and (greater of [[Essence]] or three) dangerous opponents in close range. Roll decisive damage equal to half the attack’s [[Initiative]] (round down) against the dangerous opponents. Trivial opponents take automatic decisive damage equal to the dangerous opponent who takes the most damage plus three. This attack does not use the Solar’s [[Initiative]] and does not reset her to base [[Initiative]]. The Solar may use this Charm once per battle, but may reset it by raising her [[Initiative]] to 20+ and then landing a decisive attack, or by rolling [[Join Battle]]. If the Solar knows [[Sandstorm-Wind Attack]], Whirlwind Tempest Deflection can be increased to short range by paying three extra motes.

### On [[Whirlwind-Tempest Deflection]]

The backer wanted a Charm that would allow him to block an attack and redirect a destructive shockwave around himself from parrying the force of the blow. A decidedly simple request that ended up being a fairly complicated Charm! I tried to make it as roll-free as possible while retaining its balance. Thus the limitation to how often you can use it and the similarly high cost. Backer: Scott Ryder
