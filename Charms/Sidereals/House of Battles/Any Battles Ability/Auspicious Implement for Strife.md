*The weak cling to their weapons; the Sidereal recognizes the potential for violence in every stone, dinner utensil, and piece of furniture.*
The Sidereal can reflexively ready improvised weapons on her turn and waives the Initiative cost for attacking with them. When she attacks with an improvised weapon, she may pay one mote to add (Essence, maximum 5) raw withering damage or one die of decisive damage.
With a Battles Ability 3, Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can reflexively grant an improvised weapon artifact traits for one scene by committing five motes and paying one Willpower on her turn. This doesn’t make it any more resilient to damage, but if an enhanced weapon is destroyed, the Sidereal waives the Willpower cost to reuse this Charm on a replacement.
The Sidereal can buy additional repurchases of this Charm. Each one adds an Evocation that can be used with any improvised weapon enhanced by this Charm.
These Evocations draw their themes and function from the Sidereal’s personality, Caste, and birth and Exaltation signs.
