Lashing her fate to that of what her job demands, the Sidereal does not allow herself to cease from her labors. Once the Sidereal begins a task with any Ability, she can continue to do so indefinitely, regardless of fatigue, injury, or other conditions. This doesn’t prevent her from suffering such effects. If another character acts in a way that would make it impossible for the Sidereal to meaningfully perform the task, she waives an Excellency’s cost to reduce the target number of an opposing roll with any Ability. She can roll (Stamina + Survival) against magic that doesn’t normally allow opposed rolls; the character using it makes an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll if necessary. If the Sidereal dies before completing the task, both her ghost and the hungry ghost that resides within her corpse will continue her labors. Her next incarnation may feel an inexplicable sense of urgency surrounding the Sidereal’s memories of the task if it remains unfulfilled. The Sidereal must pay five motes each hour to maintain this Charm. In combat, she must do so at the end of each turn other than the one in which she uses this Charm. It ends if she takes any nonreflexive action that’s not related to the task or basic sustenance. Reset: Once per day.
