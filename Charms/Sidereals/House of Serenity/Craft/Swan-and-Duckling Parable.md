*Even the most haggard of waterfowl might play the part of a regal swan, given proper grooming.*
The Sidereal can use Proper Plumage on another character after a scene spent having him try on outfits, giving fashion advice, tailoring his wardrobe, or buying clothes for him. Its bonus Appearance doesn’t stack with other bonus dots.
With an appropriate Craft, the Sidereal gains (Essence) gold points when that character upholds a Major or Defining Intimacy or accomplishes a major character story goal with this Charm’s help.
The Sidereal can use Proper Plumage multiple times to benefit multiple characters.
