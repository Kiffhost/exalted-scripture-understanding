*Wrapping her victim in a grotesque perfume of bile and the tang of molten metal, the sorcerer compels him to vomit up a marble of green glass — the manifestation of one of his most fundamental emotions.*

The sorcerer condenses one of a character’s emotions into a thumb-sized glass orb, rolling (Wits + Occult) with (Essence) bonus dice against the Resolve of a target within medium range. If successful, he begins to heave, inflicting a −2 penalty on all rolls until the end of his next turn. At that time, he coughs up the orb, which flies to the sorcerer’s waiting hand.

As long as the marble exists, any of the victim’s Intimacies based on the chosen emotion count as one step weaker, including emotions stirred by inspire actions or temporarily imposed by magic. He can prevent Defining Intimacies from being affected for one Willpower each.

The marble may be socketed as a hearthstone, granting the bearer two non-Charm dice on influence rolls against the target. The bearer may choose to leverage an Intimacy weakened by this spell as if it was still at its original intensity.

The spell ends immediately if the marble is destroyed, requiring no more effort than mundane quartz. It also ends if the victim swallows the marble.
# Control
A green, glassy indentation forms over the sorcerer’s heart. She may socket marbles created by this spell within it. When she sleeps with a marble socketed within it, she may roll (Perception + Occult) against the target’s Resolve to trawl through his memories associated with that emotions. The Storyteller reveals a memory that’s either useful, relevant, or insightful.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
The victim is freed from this spell’s effect for (distorting sorcerer’s Essence) days. If the sorcerer or one of her allies is within long range and has the marble, that character must make a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Athletics) roll or else drop it, even if it was socketed. It rolls one range band toward the
rival sorcerer.
