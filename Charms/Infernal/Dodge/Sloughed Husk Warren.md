*The Infernal’s skin flakes away as brass, basalt, metallic foliage, or other hellish debris, growing to engulf her anew.*

The Infernal can use this Charm on her turn, forming a barrier of hellish debris. It provides light cover and turns the ground to difficult terrain out to close range from the Infernal. For the rest of the scene, she can roll to take cover behind it as a reflexive action on her turn, including the turn she uses this Charm.

The barrier heeds the Infernal’s will — enemies don’t benefit from its cover against her attacks, and it doesn’t impede her movement.
## [[Keys]]
#### Brazen Crucible Cage (Dodge 5) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, as long as the Infernal benefits from this Charm’s cover, she can dodge attacks with successes equal to her Evasion this scene. Enemies whose Initiative is lower than hers can’t benefit from magic that reduces or ignores its cover.
#### Hellshrike Hunter’s Nest (Dodge 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal can create heavy cover. If an enemy fails a rush or disengage against her or hits her with an unarmed or natural attack while she benefits from this Charm’s cover, he suffers one die of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness.
#### Seeds on Crimson Wind (Dodge 5, Essence 4)
The Infernal can commit this Charm’s cost for one scene to cause the hellish barrier to move with her, dragged by her anima or writhing along under its own power. It leaves a trail of difficult terrain in her wake when she crosses between range bands, which remains until the start of her next turn.
