The Dragon-Blood braces her muscles with the strength and solidity of earth, becoming an unshakable pillar of stone. To use this Charm, she must be in contact with the earth — she could use it while standing on the lowest floor of a building that’s directly atop earth, but not on that building’s upper stories or roof. She doubles her [[Strength]] rating to determine whether she qualifies to attempt a feat of strength, and doubles 9s on the roll. If this would raise her [[Strength]] above the necessary minimum, each excess point adds a single non-Charm die. This Charm may only be used once per day.
