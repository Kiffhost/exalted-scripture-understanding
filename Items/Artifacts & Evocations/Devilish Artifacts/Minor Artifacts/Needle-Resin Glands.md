This artifact is a demonic graft, created from a firmin’s resin-glands and implanted beneath their bearer’s fingernails. Implanting a newly-created graft requires a hour-long surgical procedure, after which the bearer must spend a day acclimating to the graft to attune it.

When attuned for two motes, the graft lets its bearer take a ready weapon action to form a needle-weapon from the resin it exudes. She can spend one mote to create a needle with the traits of a knife, or two motes for one with the traits of a straight sword. The bearer may give created needle-weapons to other characters. She can arm an entire battle group over the course of (Size) minutes by spending (Size x 4) motes. These needle-weapons decohere into useless, sticky resin after (Essence) hours.
