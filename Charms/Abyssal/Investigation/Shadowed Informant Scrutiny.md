*The Abyssal spymaster knows better than to trust even her most loyal agents, scrutinizing their reports for the slightest flaw or falsehood.*
When another character reports the results of his investigation to the Abyssal, she mentally reconstructs the scene from his description. The witness need not have actually made an Investigation roll but must have examined the scene in a way similar to what a case scene or profile character roll entails.
The Abyssal makes her own case scene or profile character roll to examine the reconstructed events, rolling ({Perception or Wits} + Investigation). If the witness actually made an Investigation roll, his successes are added to her roll as non-Charm successes. She can use Investigation Charms to enhance her roll and otherwise examine the scene, like using Deception-Piercing Stare to evaluate statements. However, she can’t use Simple Charms or Charms that require her to examine physical evidence.
