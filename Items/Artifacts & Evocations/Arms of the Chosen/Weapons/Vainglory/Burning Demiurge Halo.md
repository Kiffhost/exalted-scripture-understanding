*When hurled, [[Vainglory]] shines with a terrible golden fire.*
This Evocation enhances the following [[Charms]] as described below: 
- The wounding effect of [[Joint-Wounding Attack]] (Exalted, p. 415) manifests as a painful scar in the shape of the Exalt’s personal sigil or insignia; mortals cannot heal this without magic. She may then spend two motes to reflexively roll a threaten or inspire action against the target to incite fear, anger, or hatred. 
- When killing a target with [[Mist on Water Attack]] (Exalted, p. 416) in a public fashion, instead of the target dying unnoticeably, the Solar may make the death obvious and grotesque in its unnatural silence. If she immediately follows it with an inspire, instill, or threaten action that uses the death as an object lesson, she gains (Conceit) non-Charm bonus dice. 
- Opponents toward whom the Solar has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of hatred take the same extra damage from [[Fiery Solar Chakram]] (Exalted, p. 419) as would ghosts or demons.
