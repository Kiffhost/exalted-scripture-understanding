*In the hands of a Sidereal thief, there are few things the sabers can’t deprive her foes of.*
The Sidereal can use Larceny instead of Martial Arts with the sabers. She can use Simple Larceny Charms that let her steal abstract or ephemeral qualities, like Name-Pilfering Practice or Sidereal Shell Games, as Supplemental Charms to enhance disarm gambits made with them, using the attack roll in place of those Charm’s usual rolls.
