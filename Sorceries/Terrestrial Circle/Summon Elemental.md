*Drawing and shaping [[Essence]] through one of the five elements, the sorcerer calls an elemental into being and binds it to her will.*
Casting this spell requires a ritual of four hours as the sorcerer channels [[Essence]] through icons of the element, draws up sigils of creation and binding, or communes with the appropriate Elemental Dragon. At the end of her ritual, she summons an elemental of up to [[Essence]] 3 into existence, creating it out of pure [[Essence]] rather than calling it from somewhere else. Once summoned, the elemental must be bound to the sorcerer’s will, as per [[Demon of the First Circle]] (p. 473), except that an elemental cannot break free—if the binding fails, the elemental simply disperses back into raw [[Essence]], and the sorcerer doesn’t regain the [[Willpower]] spent on the spell. At the end of a bound elemental’s term of service or assigned task, it usually undergoes the same fate of dissipation, although elementals who have developed a fully-formed personality and identity may persist past the end of their binding at the Storyteller’s discretion. [[Summon Elemental]] can only be cast once per day.
