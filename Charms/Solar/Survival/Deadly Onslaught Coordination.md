The Lawgiver trains her familiar to strike on command. With a flash of Essence, they strike in tandem, delivering a terrible blow. With this Charm, the Exalt can call her familiar to strike on the same instant she attacksâ€”so long as her familiar has not attacked that round, she can call it from any position in the combat order to attack her target immediately before or after her own strike.
