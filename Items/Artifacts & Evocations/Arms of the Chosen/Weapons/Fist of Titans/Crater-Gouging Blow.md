Fist of Titans unleashes the roused fury of Creation, shattering great swaths of earth and stone. After using Mammoth Slam Quake, the wielder may use this Evocation to reflexively strike the chunks of earth driven up by the shockwave, sending them flying at an enemy who failed his roll against the shockwave. Roll this as a standard withering attack with the goremaul. 

## Resonant

The attack gains +1 Overwhelming for each charge spent on Mammoth Slam Quake.
