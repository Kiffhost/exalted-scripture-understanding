*Candy-coloured joy and sickly-sweet sorrow spill from the Infernal’s lips like an insidious poison.*

When the Infernal makes a bargain, instill, or persuade roll that’s supported by an emotion she’s inspired in her targets, those characters can’t use Intimacies based on opposed emotions to bolster their Resolve or in a Decision Points. They likewise can’t use Minor Intimacies that aren’t based on emotion.

If the Infernal is inspired with the same emotion, she doubles 9s on the roll, and remains inspired until she’s affected by another inspire roll or sleeps.
## [[Keys]]
#### Mind-Melting Psychedelia (Presence 5, Essence 4)
The Infernal no longer needs to inspire a character before using this Charm, as long as her influence appeals to an emotion. Major and Defining Ties that aren’t based on emotion can’t be used to defend against the influence.
