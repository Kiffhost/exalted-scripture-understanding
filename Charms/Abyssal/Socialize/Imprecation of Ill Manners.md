*The Abyssal’s etiquette is without flaw or indiscretion — and those who claim otherwise suffer for their temerity.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a Socialize roll to reroll 1s and 2s until they cease to appear. If this causes her to succeed, she does so at the expense of someone else in the scene, whether by openly mocking him or simply upstaging him. He suffers a penalty on his next social roll this scene equal to the number of 1s and 2s the Abyssal rerolled into successful dice, maximum (her Essence).
