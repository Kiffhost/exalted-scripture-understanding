*It’s rude to keep death waiting, and the White Veil master’s manners are beyond reproach.*
She makes a decisive attack against an enemy that suffers from poison or disease (or both). The cost of Birdsong Over Blades is waived when used with this attack. If the attack hits, the victim makes a single (Stamina + Resistance) roll against the morbidity of each disease he suffers from. If he fails to beat a disease’s morbidity, it rises by one step. If a disease is already at the Defining level, it doesn’t immediately progress to death, but instead inflicts a level of unpreventable aggravated damage. Additionally, on a hit, the victim immediately suffers the damage of a single interval of one poison in his system, plus an additional interval for each attack roll threshold success, maximum (Essence + 1). If he suffers from multiple venoms, the martial artist chooses which one applies its damage. This damage doesn’t reduce the duration of the poisons themselves, but the stylist cannot apply a poison’s damage more times than it has intervals remaining. 
## Mastery
If the martial artist’s victim fails his roll against the morbidity of a disease at the Defining level, he’ll die of it — even if he has Exalted healing — after (his Stamina) turns, unless a character who has diagnosed the disease succeeds on an (Intelligence + Medicine) roll against (its morbidity + 5) as a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried. 
## Terrestrial
The martial artist must be able to make an ambush against her target to use this Charm.
