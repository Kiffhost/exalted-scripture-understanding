*The Sidereal dispenses with the intermediate steps of murder from a distance, unconcerned with the particulars of her weapon’s flight or whether she has a weapon at all.*
The Sidereal makes an unblockable decisive attack against an enemy within medium range, ignoring environmental penalties, poor visual conditions, and even full cover. If she has no weapon, she may create a blade or barb of yellow [[Essence]]. The attack has ([[Essence]]) dice of base for each range band it crosses, maximum fifteen. This ignores [[Hardness]]. It doesn’t include her [[Initiative]] or reset her to base. Against undead, it deals aggravated damage and gains −1 target number on the damage roll. If the Sidereal wishes, she may follow in the wake of a successful attack, moving up to close range with her target. This counts as her movement action for the round. 
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack that resets the Sidereal’s base [[Initiative]].
