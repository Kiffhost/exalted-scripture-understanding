*Uttering the true name of a being who does not yet exist, the sorcerer forces the universe to rectify this lack, fusing her Circle into a single entity of awe-inspiring power.*

The sorcerer merges her body and Essence with those of up to four willing characters within close range, each of whom must have a positive Defining Tie towards the other characters, either individually or as a whole. Each other participant must pay one Willpower to help catalyse the spell.

The merged characters form a single being, known as an Amalgam. It has the following traits:
- It uses all of the merged character’s Initiative tracks, rather than having one of its own. Enemies making withering attacks or using similar effects against it must choose which Initiative track to target.
- It has the highest Essence and Willpower ratings among the merged characters. It doesn’t have an independent mote pool or temporary Willpower — instead, each merged character retains their own pools.
- It uses the highest Attribute and Ability ratings among the merged characters.
- Each merged character distributes two bonus dots of Attributes and three dots of Abilities among the Amalgam’s traits, represent their particular contributions to the whole. These can raise its traits above 5, to a maximum of 10. They count as dice from Charms.
- It has (Essence + 10) −0 health levels. If it’s incapacitated, the spell ends. If it suffered any excess damage beyond its Incapacitated level, that damage is divided evenly among the merged characters, rounded down.
- If it includes Exalted, it has an anima banner, which begins at the highest level among the merged characters’. It’s is shared among them, but each level of anima spent from it counts as three levels.
- It gains three Intimacies from each character. The Storyteller may give it a further Intimacy from each character, prioritizing conflicting feelings from the component characters.
- It gains either the Legendary Size Merit or 7 dots worth of Innate Merits of the players’ choosing.
- The merged characters’ equipment combines into a composite panoply. All weapons that are compatible with a given combat Ability merge into one, using the best of each merged weapon’s traits (though not their Evocations). The same applies to armor.

The merged characters still take turns normally using their individual Initiative tracks. On a character’s turn, they become the Amalgam’s “oversoul,” The oversoul can only use their own Charms, Evocations, and similar magic, and any ongoing Charms or effects they use apply only while they remain at the fore. Characters other than the oversoul can’t use their own Charms, with the exception of Reflexive Charms that don’t create or enhance actions.

The oversoul remains in control until the start of the next constituent character’s turn. (If two merged characters act on the same tick, they choose what order they act in, but remain separate oversouls). Alternatively, the oversoul may pay one Willpower to cede control to another merged character, letting him take the turn in her stead, in addition to taking his own turn for the round. The oversoul can also do so outside of her turn to allow another character to take reflexive actions or use Charms in her stead until the next merged character’s turn.

At the end of the spell, the Amalgam dissipates, and its constituent characters reappear in a flash of light. Each of them gains one of the Intimacies given to the Amalgam by another merged character at Minor intensity, chosen by the Storyteller.

The merged characters’ players make all choices related to the Amalgam the first time this spell is cast on them. These choices remain the same for subsequent castings, though radical changes in a constituent character’s nature, expertise, or motivation may give reason for a change. Spirits and most un-Exalted supernatural beings cannot join the Amalgam; its magic relies on something fundamentally mortal which they lack.
# Control
The sorcerer chooses an additional Attribute dot and Ability dot for the Amalgam. This spell creates a bond between merged characters that endures after the Amalgam dissipates. They often unwittingly complete one another’s sentences, and always know the distance and direction to one another, as well as their general condition. They can spend one Willpower to reflexively send a mental message to the rest of the group regardless of distance, relaying a few sentences worth of thought or a single image.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
The Amalgam is destabilized, losing all bonus dots in an Attribute or Ability of the rival sorcerer’s choice and suffering a −1 penalty on all rolls for the rest of the spell’s duration. This spell can be distorted multiple times to strip bonus dots from different traits, stacking the inflicted penalty up to a maximum of −3.
