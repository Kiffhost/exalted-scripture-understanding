*The Infernal draws on the rage and cunning of a thousand wars fought among demonkind, making monsters out of mortal rabble.*

Upon learning this Charm, the Infernal gains two of its keys, each providing a demonic battle tactic. Using this Charm lets her grant one of these tactic’s benefits to any number of allied battle group within long range. Her troops are also inured to the horrors of Hell, gain +1 Resolve against fear-based influence used by demons and ignoring the increased rout difficulty from supernatural area-of-effect attacks used by demons.
## [[Keys]]
#### Blood Ape Frenzy
The battle group is overcome with bloodlust, growing bestial fangs and claws. It doubles 9s on damage roll against enemies with a wound penalty and battle groups that have lost at least one dot of Size this scene.
#### Cloud Arsenal Foresight
The battle group acts with the eerie, glassy-eyed foresight of the tomescu, adding an automatic success on Awareness rolls and rerolling 1s until they cease to appear. The Infernal gains the same benefit on order actions targeting it.
#### Living Armor Cataphracts
The soldiers’ flesh stretches, squirms, and hardens, granting it +3 soak and Hardness (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3). Any mobility penalties it suffers from armor are reduced by one.
#### Mist-Demon Shroud
The soldiers’ breath steams, forming a thick mist that engulfs them. Attacks against it suffer a −1 penalty, or −2 penalty for attacks from short range or further. Awareness rolls against it suffer a −2 penalty, and accurate assessments of its numbers, equipment, or the identities of troops is impossible without superhuman or magically enhanced senses.
#### Pride of Jade Lions
The Scripture of the Teodozjia fills soldiers’ minds, linking them together as one. They count as having elite Drill, and their eerily silent coordination adds +1 to the difficulty of rout checks triggered by their attacks. If they already have elite Drill, they increase its bonuses to +3.
