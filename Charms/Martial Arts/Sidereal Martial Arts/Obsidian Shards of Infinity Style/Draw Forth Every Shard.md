*Shatter what is, and reveal all that could be.*
The stylist may pay a five-mote surcharge when she uses [[Shattered Self Duality]] to manifest countless reflections, forming a battle group of one. She gains the follow benefits: 
- She gains [[Size]] (Essence/2, round up) and Magnitude (10 + [[Size]]). She doesn’t have [[Drill]] or [[Might]] and can still use [[Charms]]. 
- She adds ([[Size]]) dice on attack rolls and withering damage rolls. 
- She adds +([[Size]]) soak. 
- She can make both withering and decisive area attacks and engage gambits (Exalted, pp. 208-209). On withering attacks, only the highest damage roll awards [[Initiative]]. On decisive attacks, she divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among all hit enemies (rounding up) to determine the damage rolled against them. Area attacks are incompatible with Simple [[Charms]]. 
- She has (10 + [[Size]]) Magnitude. This is separate from her health track, representing the destruction of her reflections. Each time she loses a dot of [[Size]], she rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Martial Arts]]) instead of making a rout check. On a failed roll, this Charm ends, and she suffers a level of unpreventable lethal damage. 
- She can’t benefit from command actions or [[Charms]] that specifically enhance battle groups. The stylist still waives Black Shards Fall Like Ice’s [[Willpower]] cost and doesn’t appear in mirrors, but doesn’t gain any other benefits of Shattered Self Duality’s base effect.
