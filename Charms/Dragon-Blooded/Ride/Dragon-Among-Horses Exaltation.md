The Terrestrial anoints her beloved steed with her own blood, marking it with the blood of the Dragons. As the droplets fall on its hide, the beast begins to flare with the Exalt’s own anima banner, building over the next few minutes into a great bonfire of [[Essence]] in which it’s transformed. A mount transformed by this Charm gains the following benefits: 
-  It gains one of the following: +1 die to all [[Strength]]-based dice pools and raw withering damage; +1 die to all [[Dexterity]]-based dice pools; or +1 die to all [[Stamina]]-based dice pools and +1 soak. 
-  Its natural [[Hardness]] increases by one point. Note that this renders it immune to anima flux (p. 154). 
-  It gains two additional −4 health levels. The Dragon-Blood can only use this Charm on a single mountatatime,butisrefundeditsexperiencepointcostif that creature dies. Rare horses descended from bloodlines intermingled with elementals of the appropriate aspect are prized by the Dragon-Blooded, and using this Charm on them requires no experience cost. The Blessed Isle’s horse-breeders compete ruthlessly over such stock, which are sufficiently rare that [[Resources]] expenditures alone aren’t enough to secure them. A Dynast might need to procure an opulent gift simply to open negotiations with a seller, or perform a significant favor for a family elder in exchange for making use of his connections.
