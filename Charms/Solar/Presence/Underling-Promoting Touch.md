With a touch, the Exalt raises a servant to the role of a champion. By using this Charm and touching a person who serves or follows her, the Lawgiver temporarily makes her subject the beneficiary of respect and admiration usually reserved for the Solar. Characters who have ties of loyalty, respect or admiration to the Solar now also feel the same way toward her charge. Additionally, the character also inherits any social station or role it is within the Solar’s right to grant, and all characters who are subject to that station instantly recognize that they are subject to the promoted one’s authority.
