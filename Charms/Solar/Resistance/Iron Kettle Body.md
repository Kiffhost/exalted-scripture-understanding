Striking the Solar is like striking a piece of iron. For one round, all post-soak withering damage is halved (round up). This Charm must be invoked when an attack is directed at the Solar, but before it is rolled. At [[Essence]] 3+, less accurate blows glance and rebound painfully from the Solar’s body—1s on a successful attack roll subtract from the attacker’s [[Initiative]] at a rate of -1 for each 1 rolled, to a maximum of half the Solar’s [[Stamina]], rounded up. At [[Essence]] 4+, [[Initiative]] points lost striking the Exalt’s [[Iron Kettle Body]] are awarded to the Solar. Triggering [[Adamant Skin Technique]] cancels Iron Kettle Body’s effects for one tick. Iron Kettle Body’s bonuses may not be used to enhance [[Adamant Skin Technique]].
