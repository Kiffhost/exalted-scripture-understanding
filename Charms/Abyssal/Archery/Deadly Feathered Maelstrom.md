*Her fingers an unnatural blur, the Abyssal draws and fires a barrage of arrows.*
The Abyssal makes up to ([[Dexterity]]) decisive attacks dividing her [[Initiative]] evenly among them, rounded up. She doesn’t need to aim to attack enemiesat medium range. Each 10 on these attack rolls adds one die to that attack’s damage roll. Her [[Initiative]] doesn’t reset until all attacks are completed.
