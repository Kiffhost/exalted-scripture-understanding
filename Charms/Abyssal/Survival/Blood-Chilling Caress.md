*Crimson ice is the Abyssal’s blood, and snowflakes are her tears.*
The Abyssal’s body becomes unnaturally cold, granting the following benefits:
 - Her touch is cold enough to kill, adding ([[Essence]]) to the raw damage of unarmed withering attacks and (Essence/2) damage dice on decisive attacks. An enemy who takes 5+ withering damage or any decisive damage suffers a −1 environmental penalty on [[Dexterity]] rolls from the cold until the end of his next turn.
 - Characters who hit the Abyssal with an unarmed attack suffer ([[Essence]]) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This damage inflicts the same penalty as above. Enemies who grapple her suffer this damage again at the start of each turn.
 - She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on rolls to resist cold-based environmental hazards. While using [[Maelstrom-Weathering Indifference]], she doubles 8s against such hazards.
 - She can freeze water with a touch, enabling stunts like running along a body of water by freezing it beneath her feet.
