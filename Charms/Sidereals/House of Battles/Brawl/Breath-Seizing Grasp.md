The Sidereal brings her foe down with her as she drowns, hand in bloodstained hand. The Sidereal doesn’t lose rounds of control when she’s attacked or damaged by lower-Initiative enemies, enemies of fate, or a grappled foe. If she and her foe are both suffocating (Exalted, p. 232), each round of asphyxiation he suffers grants her another round’s worth of breath. If he’s immune to what’s suffocating her — e.g., a Water Aspect grappled underwater — she can breathe freely for the clinch’s duration.
