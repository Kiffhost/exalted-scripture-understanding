*While her familiar is under the effects of the prerequisite, the Solar may infuse it with a surge of anima-laden Essence, magnifying its strength and size to a frightening degree.*
Using this Charm automatically triggers [[Saga Beast Virtue]], replacing the cost of that Charm entirely. It also makes the size bonuses from all familiar-enhancing [[Charms]] non-optional; all take effect while this Charm is active. In addition, the familiar grows massively large. 
Large creatures grow exponentially; a bull grows larger than a war elephant, while already gigantic creatures grow slightly less, a war elephant growing large enough to peer into a second story window. Smaller familiars become large enough to ride, reaching excesses of 1000 pounds. 
In addition to the benefits of the prerequisite and [[Saga Beast Virtue]], familiars gain an additional three mutations. The largest familiars (tyrant lizards, mammoths, giant snakes) gain three automatic non-Charm successes to their feats of strength, and may reach into the short range band to attack targets. In addition, targets at short range must roll disengage to move away from such a massive opponent. As targets at close range must also disengage to escape, a target who starts at close range must disengage twice to get away. Such familiars double the hardness from any purchases of [[Hide-Hardening Practice]] and gain two additional -4 health levels and three additional -0 health levels while this Charm is active. The smaller familiars compensate by gaining three automatic non-Charm successes to rush and disengage, and one automatic success to each of their attacks. They gain two -0 health levels.

### On [[Colossal Rampaging Beast]]

The backer wanted another size booster for his familiar, one that would let his smaller creature get large enough to ride. I decided “why stop there?” and made it so your pet tyrant lizard becomes a fortress-busting tank. Backer: Michael Brewer
