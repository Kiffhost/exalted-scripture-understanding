*The Infernal is master of all hellish powers, subsuming demonic Essence into her own glory.*

The Infernal can temporarily learn Eclipse Charms from demons, and can stack multiple uses to gain up to (Essence) Eclipse Charms. She can learn them permanently for eight experience points each, after which they don’t count toward the maximum. She waives the experience point cost of the first Eclipse Charm she learns this way.

With Occult 5, Essence 3, if the Infernal has [[Wayward Divinity Oversight]], she can learn Eclipse Charms from any entity it’s compatible with. She must commit three motes for each Charm she learns from a non-demon, unless she learns them permanently with experience.
