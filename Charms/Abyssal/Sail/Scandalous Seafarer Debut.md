*Wrapped in brine and myth, the deathknight’s arrival is presaged by stories of her exploits.*
After a scene spent spreading stories or rumors about herself, her ship, or her crew, the Abyssal rolls (Social Attribute + Sail), banking a pool of non-Charm dice.
Over the next few hours or days, the rumor spreads throughout the community she’s in, repeated by superstitious mariners, sung in eerie children’s rhymes, and whispered by unseen phantoms.
While acting in a way that fits the rumors, the Abyssal can add these banked non-Charm dice to Sail rolls, Larceny rolls, and influence rolls with any Ability, up to a maximum of (higher of Essence or 3) dice. She can likewise expend two dice to add +1 non-Charm Guile or Resolve, maximum +2.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, this Charm may end if the Abyssal spends significant amounts of time away from the community she used it in.
## Special activation rules
When the Abyssal sails into a port, she can use this Charm without needing to spend time spreading rumors, preceded by disquieting omens of her arrival. She adds a free full Excellency on the roll.
## Reset
Once per session.
