*The martial artist’s understanding of the many vectors by which her Essence might be corrupted shields her from such afflictions.*
The stylist clashes an enemy’s attempt to inflict a poison, disease, crippling effect, Shaping effect, Psyche effect, possession, or sorcerous curse on her. She rolls (Wits + Medicine), adding a free full Excellency, opposing his attack or other roll. If the effect is normally unrolled, her enemy makes an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll. Success negates that effect and renders her immune to all further effects of that type for the scene.
### Enlightenment
Success also ends any such unwanted effects already afflicting the stylist.
