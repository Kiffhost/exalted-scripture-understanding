*The Infernal’s eyes burn a vivid emerald as her muscles swell with impossible strength.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- Her withering attacks ignore (higher of Essence or 3) soak. Her decisive attacks ignore the same amount of Hardness.
- When she hits with a decisive attack or crashes an enemy, she gains a bonus dot of Strength, up to a maximum of (lower of Essence or Strength) dots. This can raise her Strength above 5.
- She adds (Strength) to her effective Initiative to determine when she acts in turn order. This includes bonus dots from this Charm.
- Any thaumaturgical divination used within one mile of her automatically fails, returning only a single result: “The monster is here.” 
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she deals 5+ damage to a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack. She gains a bonus dot of Strength for that attack.
