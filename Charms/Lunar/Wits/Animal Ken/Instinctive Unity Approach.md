*The unity between Lunar and companion beast transcends the need for words; the instant she forms her intention, her familiar knows her will.*
When a familiar the Lunar has enhanced with [[Blessed Moon-Beast Empowerment]] makes an (Attribute + Ability) roll, the Lunar adds up to ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice for one [[Initiative]] each. Alternatively, she may raise one of such a familiarâ€™s static values by up to (Essence/2, rounded up) as a non-Charm bonus for an instant, for two [[Initiative]] per +1 bonus. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar is in the shape of the same animal as her familiar, she adds an additional non-Charm success on the enhanced roll or +1 to the enhanced value.
