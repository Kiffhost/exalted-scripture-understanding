The Sidereal holds her patron Maiden’s sanction as an envoy to realms beyond fate’s reach. When the Sidereal deals with enemies of fate, they can’t take offense at her words or craftsmanship, nor can they form negative Ties toward her because of them, so long as she doesn’t intend to give offense. Any negative Ties they have toward Sidereals, the Exalted, or denizens of Creation or Yu-Shan are treated as one step lower. They can pay one [[Willpower]] to resist this for one scene. If the Sidereal knows [[Terrestrial Circle Sorcery]], she can offer a First Circle demon a year and a day of freedom from Malfeas as part of a bargain roll, letting it walk Creation unbound for that time. With [[Essence]] 3, she can free Second Circle demons until the next full moon. With [[Essence]] 5, she can free a Third Circle during the next Calibration. She can’t release more than one demon at a time this way.
