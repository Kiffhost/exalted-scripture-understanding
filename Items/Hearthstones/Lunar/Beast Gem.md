All trained animals within three miles of this stone are unusually healthy and fertile. More importantly, they give birth to exceptional offspring. The offspring of trained animals born in this area are all obedient, good-tempered and as smart as monkeys, while also being as healthy and strong as the best members of their breed. This stone only affects the offspring of animals who are born in this region and at least one of whose parents were trained as a riding animal, beast of burden or guard animal.
