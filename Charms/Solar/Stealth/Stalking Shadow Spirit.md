Upon using this Charm, the Exalt patrols an area for an hour, studying its shadows and learning its secrets. During this time, the Solar examines boltholes, discovers blind-spots and sight-lines, and prepares hiding places. At the end of the hour, roll the Solar’s Wits + Stealth, adding (Essence) automatic successes. Successes on this roll are available to the Lawgiver as long as the Charm is committed or until spent entirely. These successes can only be used on Stealth attempts within the specific location the Solar patrolled, but the player can parcel them out across multiple attempts, deciding when to use them, and how many to use. The Solar is expressly allowed to use these successes after making the Stealth roll. 

## Special activation rules

Typically this Charm allows the Lawgiver to cover an area the size of a large warehouse or small park. This area can be slightly increased, but the Storyteller should apply a difficulty of 1 or 2 to the roll if the player wants to extend the range of the effect. By spending five points accrued by the Larceny Charm Master Plan Meditation (see Exalted, p. 318), this Charm may be used retroactively, as long as the Solar has the motes.

### On Stalking Shadow Spirit

The backer wanted a Charm that would help him feel like he has Matrix-level knowledge of his surroundings, able to anticipate where others will be looking or standing to simply not be there. Players are encouraged, while spending the successes to augment concealment, to describe their Solar’s manipulation of sight-lines and blindspots, to stand to the left when a guard is facing right, and so on. As a side-note, all Charms that accrue successes for you to use later treat those as “non-Charm” successes unless otherwise stated. Backer: Clete D. Collum
