Pulling at an enemy’s spirit with the saber’s hooked tips, the wielder disarms him of his body. 

## Resonant

Only characters resonant with the sabers can awaken this Evocation. 

The wielder makes a special disarm gambit against an enemy who’s crashed, suffering at least a −4 wound penalty, or 2+ range bands away from any weapons he had with him at the start of the fight, if any. She adds his (higher of his Essence or 3) to the gambit’s difficulty. If successful, his spirit is ejected from his body. His player controls the spirit, which uses his traits but is dematerialized and lacks access to any of his artifacts or other equipment. The dematerialized character can’t interact with material objects normally unless he has applicable magic. However, if he’s attacked using magic that can strike dematerialized targets, he can attack that enemy normally until the end of his next turn, striking through the rift they’ve cut in the veil. The sabers’ wielder can perceive and attack him normally. If she damages him or succeeds on a disarm gambit against him, she may knock him one range band away from his body. The victim can attempt to end this Evocation by possessing his own body, an extended ([Charisma, Intelligence, or Wits] + Occult) roll with difficulty 5, goal number 10, and an interval of one round. Attempting this roll can’t be flurried. A decisive against the victim’s body becomes an ambush, but the fear of mortal peril drives him back into his body afterward. Withering attacks can’t be made against his body; there’s no strategic advantage in pressuring an unconscious foe.
