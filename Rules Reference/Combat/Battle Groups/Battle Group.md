Simply put, a battle group is treated as a character with the traits of the average combatant making up the group, plus a few other traits which modify these capabilities.

Battle groups are an abstraction used whenever there are more than two combatants on the battlefield who are reasonably similar to one another in terms of capabilities and equipment, who aren’t especially noteworthy to the story as individuals, and who aren’t potent supernatural beings such as Exalts. Battle groups can represent small groups, such as a squad of a dozen of the Tri-Khan of Chiaroscuro’s palace guards, or vast forces such as 1,000 men-at-arms riding to war.
# Overview
Before we get down to details, here’s a basic idea of how a battle group works: A battle group is a group of fighters who are mechanically represented as one character. A group of soldiers, for example, is basically a single soldier, except this soldier gets a number of bonuses to his [[Attack]], damage, [[Soak]], and [[Defense]] based on his battle group traits. He always uses [[Attack#withering|withering attacks]] against you (which start inflicting [[Health Track]] damage once you run out of [[Initiative]]). By contrast, your withering attacks don’t take his [[Initiative]], but instead directly damage his “Health.” He’s got a special [[Health Track]] (called a [[Magnitude Track]]) that can absorb a lot of punishment, and it’s likely that a battle group will break and run before being totally destroyed—whenever you empty the [[Magnitude Track]], there’s a chance they’ll flee or [[Surrender]]. If they don’t, their Magnitude refills, but their combat bonuses become weaker, and it gets harder for them not to rout next time they run out of Magnitude.
# Traits
There are only four differences between a solo character’s traits and those of a battle group: battle groups have three special values that individual heroes don’t ([[Size]], [[Drill]], and [[Might]]), and instead of a [[Health Track]], they have a [[Magnitude Track]].
# Fighting Battle Groups
To keep things straightforward, fighting a battle group in most ways resembles fighting an ordinary character with its traits inflated a bit by [[Size]], [[Drill]], and possibly [[Might]]. There are a few key differences, detailed below:
## Making Attacks
Battle groups can only launch [[Attack#withering|withering]] attacks. While these can damage a target’s [[Initiative]] as usual, the lost [[Initiative]] is not gained by the battle group—it vanishes. Any damage the battle group inflicts against a target that has fallen into [[Initiative#Crash]], however, is instead applied directly to the target’s [[Health Track]] as bashing or lethal damage, whichever is appropriate to the standard armament of the battle group. 

Battle groups *never enjoy the Double 10s rule on damage rolls*.
## Area Attacks
Like other characters, battle groups can only make a single [[Attack]] on their turn, but these are often large attacks, consisting of hundreds of flashing blades or sheets of arrows darkening the sky. As a result, when a battle group makes a close-ranged attack, it makes a single [[Attack#hit roll|attack roll]] and applies that roll’s results to all enemies in direct contact with the group (depending on the battle group’s [[Size]], this could potentially cover a considerable area). When a battle group makes a ranged attack, it must select a single primary target for the attack. If this target is another battle group, the attack resolves normally; if it’s an individual, then the attack is also applied to all other individual characters (friendly or hostile) within [[Range#Close]] of that target. Huge mobs of archers make poor precision snipers.
## Inert [[Initiative]]
Because battle groups can’t make [[Attack#decisive|decisive]] attacks and can’t take [[Initiative]] from other characters, their [[Initiative]] rating is used entirely to determine when the group takes its turn during each round. On the other hand, all [[Attack#withering|withering]] attacks launched against a battle group instead directly damage its [[Magnitude Track]]. *Successful withering attacks directed against a battle group still generate one automatic point of [[Initiative]] for the attacker.*
## Damaging Battle Groups
[[Attack#withering|Withering]] attacks directed against a battle group are resolved normally, save that their damage is applied to the group’s [[Magnitude Track]] rather than its [[Initiative]]. [[Attack#decisive|Decisive]] attacks directed against a battle group also resolve normally, save that they, too, are applied to its Magnitude, and inflict 1 additional level of automatic damage per four damage dice rolled (round up).

When the groups [[Magnitude Track]] fills with damage, it loses a point of [[Size]] and must make a [[Rout]] check to avoid dissolving.

If a character causes a battle group to lose a point of [[Size]] or to dissolve, she gains an [[Initiative#Break]] bonus, just as though she’d sent an opponent into [[Initiative#Crash]].
## Taking Actions
Battle Groups may take most of the same actions as normal characters. Notably, they can’t take [[Grappling|Grapple]] actions. Rather than grappling, battle groups [[Grappling#Engage|Engage]], swarming the enemy with numbers for more reliable but less flexible grapple.
# [[Movement]]
Battle groups use the same movement system as individual heroes, but they take up a lot more space than a single person does. Depending on their [[Size]], they can be truly enormous, potentially covering hundreds of yards of ground.

As a general rule, a battle group can direct attacks with its full strength at any character or group within range of any edge of the group. Also as a result of this enormous size, individual characters are capable of moving through the space occupied by a battle group, crossing it as [[Difficult Terrain]] at a cost of 1 [[Initiative]] per round spent doing so (battle groups can’t move through one another). Storytellers must use common sense when deciding what sort of positioning-based actions to allow individual characters to take—two characters at close range to a 500 man battle group on opposite sides of it, for example, may well be at long range with regard to one another

Battle groups can potentially spread out to cover truly enormous amounts of ground, allowing them to direct close-range attacks at a greater variety of characters, but if the members of the group spread out so much that the average space between group members is 10 yards or more, the group loses all [[Size]] advantages to its attacks.

Battle groups don’t need to take [[Disengage]] actions to move away from opponents two or more points of [[Size]] smaller than themselves.
# Complications
There are two additional factors to consider when using battle groups:
## Perfect Morale
Some rare [[Battle Group]]s possess a quality called perfect morale. A battle group with perfect morale is made up of fighters incapable of fear. Such a group automatically succeeds at all [[Rout]] checks, and simply will not retreat unless ordered to do so. Fearless battle groups enjoy a +3 bonus to their [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]], but cannot benefit from [[Rally for numbers]] actions (since all of their casualties represent fighters killed or injured too badly to continue fighting).

The most common groups with perfect morale seen in the Age of Sorrows are mindless undead, although legends of the First Age speak of fearless groups of [[Brass Legionnaire|clockwork legionnaires]] and similar wonders of mystic artifice. If such a force could be excavated and restored to working order in the Second Age, it would be a treasure beyond price.
## Slaughter
While a [[Battle Group]] that has suffered [[Rout]] and *dissolved* is no longer a meaningful actor in battle, the surviving fighters that made up the group still exist— they’re usually either laying down arms or running away from the fight in an uncoordinated manner. In the latter case, if allowed to escape, they may very well re-form and offer battle again at a later date. As a result, the standard military response to a rout is to run down the fleeing survivors and slaughter them.

This gruesome practice consists of simply directing [[Attack]] actions at the fleeing battle group, which suffers a -3 penalty to its [[Defense]]. As the group no longer has any [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]], the Storyteller simply looks at the damage inflicted and the number of fleeing soldiers, and estimates what it amounts to in terms of dead enemies—the more damage, the more carnage inflicted against the routing battle group.

Of note, if the fleeing group is of a [[Size]] greater than 2, then only other battle groups can generally attempt slaughter attacks against it—an individual hero just can’t cut down enough fleeing soldiers to make much of a dent in a 600-man retreat, at least not without powerful magic such as battlefield [[sorcery]].
