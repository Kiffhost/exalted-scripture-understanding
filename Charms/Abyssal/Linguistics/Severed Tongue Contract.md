*Invoking pacts scribed in blood, the Abyssal claims the voices of those who deal with her as death will claim their final breath.*
The Abyssal makes it possible for a willing character to transfer his knowledge of a language to another:
trading it for a favor, staking it on a game of chance, lending it to an ally, etc. Both characters must sign a contract in blood. This doesn’t just transfer his knowledge of the language — the recipient gains the donor’s accent, vocabulary, and understanding of slang and idiom. The donor loses all understanding of that language. The contact can specify a duration or a condition that will terminate it. Otherwise, it lasts for as long as this Charm remains active. If the donor faces a threat to a Defining [[Intimacy]] because he lacks his voice, he may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist, ending the contract early. Characters with [[Willpower]] 5+ can resist if any [[Intimacy]] is threatened, but must pay (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) [[Willpower]] if it isn’t Defining.
If the Abyssal knows [[False Gospel Forgery]], she can use it to forge someone’s signature and steal one of their languages for herself. She must have access to his blood, which can be obtained by dealing lethal damage to him in combat or through whatever means the deathknight can think of outside of it. She makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Linguistics]]) influence roll against him, regardless of distance. His Intimacies don’t modify his [[Resolve]] against this influence. If successful, she steals one of his languages for this Charm’s duration, as above.
[[Moonshadow]] Castes waive their oath-binding anima power’s [[Willpower]] cost if they use it to seal this contract, inflicting retribution on those who violate it by spending [[Willpower]] to resist or breaking any other term of the contract. This isn’t compatible with forgeries.
