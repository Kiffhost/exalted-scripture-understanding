*The Infernal catches a projectile in mid-flight as if plucking an insect from the air.*

The Infernal clashes a ranged attack by catching its projectile in a free hand, rolling a special (Dexterity + Thrown) decisive attack. If successful, she catches the incoming projectile and may reflexively ready it, but doesn’t roll damage or reset her Initiative.
## [[Keys]]
#### Thousand Dagger Wind (Thrown 5)
The Infernal no longer needs a free hand to clash, catching projectiles in eddies of wind that swirl around her. She may reflexively ready these weapons. They spin around her until the scene ends, although an enemy can strike one from the air with a disarm gambit. The Infernal can use [[Firefly Arrowhead Grip]] as a Simple Charm to make a decisive attack by launching all suspended projectiles, adding two dice of damage per projectile. She adds +1 to her base Initiative upon resetting for each projectile, maximum (Essence). The attack has the highest range among any of suspended Thrown weapons, or short range if none of the projectiles are thrown.
#### Wind Returns Gifts (Thrown 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, the Infernal flings the projectile back at her attacker if she wins the clash, making a decisive roll normally. She can choose to apply the benefits of any Charms or other effects used to enhance the attack she clashed, but doing so denies her the benefits of any of her own magic.
