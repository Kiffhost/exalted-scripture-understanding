In becoming one with strange forces, the Solar experiences the hardships of the infinite. Through their suffering she is enlightened. This Charm upgrades Ancient Tongue Understanding, bringing the Solar’s Essence closer to true embodiment of the spirit of the Old Realm language. If she adds a point of Willpower to the cost of the prerequisite, then any Occult roll she makes is enhanced while it is active, rolling additional dice for (Essence) 10s that appear in the result. If any 10s appear in these bonus dice, they are also rolled again.
