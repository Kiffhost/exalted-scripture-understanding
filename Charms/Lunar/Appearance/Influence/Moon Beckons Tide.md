The Lunar releases a sigh of dreamy silver anima, calling a willing paramour to her side. She makes a special (Appearance + Presence) persuade roll with (Essence) automatic successes against a character with a Tie of love, lust, etc., toward her within (Essence x3) miles, convincing him to seek out the Lunar. She can either specify a known character or reach out aimlessly, letting the Storyteller choose a qualifying character within range, if one exists. Affected characters become aware of her general location and condition, adding (Intimacy) bonus dice on Athletics, Ride, Sail, and Survival rolls to reach her. If no such characters are in range, she recoups this Charm’s Willpower cost. With an Appearance 5 repurchase, the Lunar may describe a companion she would like to attract rather than choosingsomeonewithaTietowardher.Herdescription can encompass physical details, skills or talents, particular Intimacies, and social class or profession — “a farmer whoresentstheRealm’spresence,”“abeautifulwomanat least six feet tall,” “a master thief fluent in Flametongue,” etc. — but not supernatural ability, membership in particular groups, or other traits. She can’t choose a specific character, and the Storyteller should veto descriptions so narrow they could only apply to one person. If no such characters are in range, the Lunar has the option of calling the character who comes closest to matching her description instead of recouping Willpower.
