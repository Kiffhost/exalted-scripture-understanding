The sorcerer feeds not only on base matter, but also on the revulsion her hunger inspires in others. Once per scene, when she violates a social expectation, law, or taboo by consuming bizarre things or through strange or excessive hunger, she gains three sorcerous motes. They last until the end of the scene. If this causes at least one character to gain or strengthens a negative Tie towards her, she gains (Intimacy) additional sorcerous motes, which last until she next uses this ritual.
