*No knowledge is forbidden to the Infernal, no blasphemous secret beyond her comprehension.*

The Infernal adds (Essence/2, rounded up) successes on an Occult roll, and rerolls 6s until they cease to appear. If she rerolls at least three 6s, she adds an additional automatic success and gains a Minor Intimacy related to the purpose or subject of her roll. Such Intimacies are always strange and uncanny, alienating the Infernal from humanity or making her more like the denizens of Malfeas. Binding a demon might give her a Tie of dominance over it, while studying the tides of the Wyld might give her an appreciation for its inchoate beauty.
