The Sidereal believes that one of her personal goals, chosen by her player, is vital to destiny and the good of Creation. Even if her ambition is in outright opposition to the heavenly agenda, she believes this to be the result of corruption, mismanagement, and incompetence among those responsible for planning destiny. She must act to advance her agenda whenever she has the opportunity, prioritizing it above all other courses of action, unless doing so would cause direct physical harm to someone for whom she has a positive Tie.
This ends if the Siderealâ€™s pursuit of her ambition stops a destined event from coming to pass or creates a significant peril, obstacle, or complication to one of her Major or Defining Intimacies.
