The Dragon-Blood lets the fires of her performance consume her, radiating passionate intensity with every word, note, or movement. She makes an inspire roll using ([Charisma or Appearance] + Performance), rolling an additional non-Charm die for every 10. The emotions she inflames are incredibly intense, compelling an equally intense response from her audience. While the player of an affected character still chooses how that character reacts to the influence, his reaction must rise to the level of at least a serious task (Exalted, p. 216) chosen by his player. Resisting this influence costs three Willpower. Immolating Passion Alleluia can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) by influencing a character to act on his passions.
