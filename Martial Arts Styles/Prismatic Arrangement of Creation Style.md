# [[Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Style]]
[[Essence]] is immanent in all things, even the least grain of sand. It is both primal substrate of reality and the grand cosmology of worlds raised upon it. The flow of [[Essence]] is the dance of all things. Prismatic Arrangement of Creation style is a meditation on the world’s [[Essence]]. Drawing from the primal force that gave rise to all things, it’s considered the most foundational Sidereal Martial Art and is among the most commonly practiced within the Bureau of Destiny.
The style’s creator is thought to have trained under many martial artists among the Exalted and the spirits of the world, studying the nature of each master’s [[Essence]] to attain understanding of another facet of reality. Learning the style requires refining one’s control over [[Essence]] through breathing exercises, secluded meditation, and cyclically expending and respiring [[Essence]]. Students also seek out spirits, other Exalted, places of geomantic power, and other manifestations of [[Essence]] to expand their understanding of [[Essence]] beyond their own.
## Weapons
This style’s unarmed strikes are primarily pushing blows that disrupt enemies’ balance and footing, along with offensive elbow and shoulder strikes. It’s incompatible with weaponry.
## Armour
This style is incompatible with armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
Stylists gain [[Lore]] and [[Occult]] as they study the world’s [[Essence]]. Some incorporate [[Performance]] into this style, another path to understanding the dance of all things, although the style’s [[Charms]] don’t use it. 
## Nature
Both Flowing and Still.
