An eerie chill falls over the battlefield as Glacial Mantle’s wielder advances to the frontlines. She exudes supernatural cold out to short range, an environmental hazard with difficulty (higher of wearer’s [[Essence]] or 3) and Damage 1B/round. Allied battle groups that benefit from [[Tundra-Conquering Strategos]] are immune to this hazard. If this depletes an enemy battle group’s Magnitude, the rout check is made at +1 difficulty.
Additionally, while this Evocation is active, when the wearer uses [[Frozen Aegis]] against an attack, she can make an unblockable decisive attack with sheer cold, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[War]]). Success inflicts one die of bashing damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t reset the wearer to base [[Initiative]].
If the wearer is fighting under a stratagem enacted with [[Winter Brings Death]], the damage inflicted by both the environmental hazard and counterattacks increases to ([[Essence]]) dice.
## Resonant
The wearer’s allies are immune to this hazard.
