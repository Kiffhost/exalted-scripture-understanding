A dark ocean stirs into wakefulness, its waters spilling forth to swirl around the wielder’s feet and drag at enemies with unnerving strength. While Sea’s Verdict’s anima is glowing, enemies within close range of the wielder are slowed as though moving through difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) if their [[Initiative]] is lower than hers. At burning or higher, the whirlpool clutches possessively at fallen foes, applying the difficult terrain penalty on rolls to rise from prone. At bonfire, the penalty rises to −4.
