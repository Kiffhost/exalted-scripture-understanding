The Dragon-Blood meditates on the deepest depths of herself, discovering that she is eternal. After spending an hour in meditation, she rolls (Essence + Stamina), unmodified by other effects. Each success grants her a temporary −1 health level. Undamaged health levels fade away at the end of this Charm’s duration, but the Dragon-Blood keeps any levels that are filled with damage, and they count against her total successes on a subsequent roll to use this Charm. These health levels are healed before any others of the same level when the Exalt recovers from rest or receives magical healing. If the Dragon-Blood carries a wounded health level for more than (Stamina) days, it falls from a −1 to a −2 health level. After another (Stamina x2) days, they become −4 levels. Damaged levels vanish once they’re healed.
