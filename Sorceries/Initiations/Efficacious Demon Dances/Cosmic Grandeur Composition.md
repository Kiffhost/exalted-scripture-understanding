Once per day, the sorcerer can spend a scene studying the movements of something of cosmic, personal, or inscrutable significance, from ants on the march to the stars themselves. She makes a difficulty 3 (Perception + Occult) roll and gains (1 + extra successes) sorcerous motes. These last for the rest of the story or until she uses this ritual again. She can only spend them on spells that affect her observed target or invoke its nature, or on her control spell.
