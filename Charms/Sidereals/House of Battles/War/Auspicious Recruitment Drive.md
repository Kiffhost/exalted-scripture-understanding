The Sidereal draws those around her into the web of conflict, weaving fate to fill her forces’ ranks. After spending a day recruiting soldiers, negotiating with mercenaries, posting that she’s calling up troops, or inciting crowds to violence, the Sidereal rolls ([Appearance, [[Charisma]], or Manipulation] + [[War]]). She recruits a battle group with one dot of [[Size]] for every two successes. The Storyteller can provide more or less generous troop traits based on the events of the story and the Sidereal’s stunt. This battle group is willing to fight under the Sidereal or a character designated by her, though they aren’t guaranteed to have any [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward their commander. By default, this battle group has battle-ready troop traits (Exalted, p. 496), average [[Drill]], and [[Might]] 0. The Sidereal can increase the battle group’s traits to elite troops (Exalted, p. 497) or increase its [[Drill]] to elite, with each such upgrade increasing the cost per dot of [[Size]] by one success. She can also increase its [[Might]] to 1 by increasing the cost by two successes per dot if she could reasonably recruit beastfolk, God-Blooded, or other such characters. At the end of the story, the battle group dissolves as its surviving members return to their lives unless the Storyteller deems the Sidereal has treated them well enough to retain their enduring loyalty. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] by leading a battle group in combat. Shieldbearers can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
