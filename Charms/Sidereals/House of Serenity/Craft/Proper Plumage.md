*The Sidereal’s impeccable taste earns her the world’s esteem, ensuring her wardrobe is never found wanting.*
After a scene spent trying on, styling, mending, or creating clothing, the Sidereal dons an outfit appropriate for some specific event or occasion. While she wears it, she gains a bonus dot of [[Appearance]], which can raise her [[Appearance]] above 5. She loses the [[Hideous]] Merit if she has it. With an appropriate [[Craft]], like tailoring or weaving, the Sidereal can gain ([[Essence]]) silver points for using this Charm once per day.
