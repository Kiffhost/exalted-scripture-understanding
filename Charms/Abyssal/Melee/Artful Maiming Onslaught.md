*The Abyssal’s blade arcs through the air like cruel lightning, leaving behind severed limbs and bloody stumps.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after landing a decisive attack, before the damage roll. If her victim doesn’t commit to accepting the highest level of crippling injury possible (Exalted, p. 201) in advance, the Abyssal adds ([[Strength]]) dice of damage and rolls an additional die for every 9 and 10 on the damage roll. She gains one [[Willpower]] if this incapacitates him or he accepts a crippling injury.
If the enemy takes a crippling injury, it doesn’t count against his once-per-story limit on doing so, and he’s immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene.
This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived against trivial opponents, and the deathknight can choose what crippling injuries they suffer, rather than their player. However, the Abyssal can’t gain [[Willpower]] from maiming such foes.
