All windblades allow the wielder to fly while standing atop them for five motes per hour of flight. They can travel at a speed of thirty-five miles per hour, but can't ascend more than medium range above the ground. Aerial movement ona  windblade uses the same dice pools as ordinary movement, but the windblade adds its Speed Bonus to the roll as non-Charm dice. The Speed Bonus is halved, rounded down, if the windblade is weighed down by anything more than the wielder and her personal possessions, such as a second person being carried by her or unusually heavy cargo.

A windblade's wielder can take a miscellaneous action to collapse it, rendering it nonfunctional but reducing it to the size of a heavy belt buckle. She can return it to full size with another miscellaneous action. A windblade's Evocations can't be used while collapsed unless they specify otherwise.
