The Solar is invigorated by the annihilation of her seafaring foes. Upon successfully incapacitating an enemy ship with a naval maneuver, roll a free full Sail Excellency. Successes on this roll restore an equal number of motes to the Solar’s Essence pool, to a limit of motes she has spent on Sail Charms in the scene. In addition, the Solar may trade four of these motes for a single point of willpower, but may gain no more than a single point of willpower for the defeat of a single enemy ship.
