Long did the [[Twilight]] lord Urashni contemplate the battle-virtues of the [[Solar Exalted]]. He concluded that his companions were without peer in their speed, precision of force, balance of defense, surety of footing, and tireless stamina. And yet in those days countless were the primal monsters who would grow two limbs for each one severed, or dream-conjured armies whose each drop of spilled blood would give forth two new soldiers. Skill alone struggled to prevail against such foes. And so Urashni cultivated a powerful demesne in the remote East. Situated at the bottom of a natural bore, he built at its nadir a lowdomed manse of sun-heated metal and smoking stones, focusing and channeling the elemental glory of fire down and down to a forge built for only one purpose. Urashni warded himself with efficacious spells and lesser protective artifacts as he worked, so that the superheated air would not scald his flesh from his bones, nor the furnace-glowing walls and floors roast him alive. In this artificial, inverted volcano-manse, he forged one of the most destructive fire daiklaves to grace the battlefields of the First Age—a final answer to monsters. When the blade was complete, Urashni dismantled the forge and reconfigured the room into a temple to house and nourish the destructive magnificence of his creation. The weapon he forged burned a path across the pages of history and the face of Creation, spoken of with admiration and trepidation. [[Volcano Cutter]] proved a wild daiklave, unruly in the hands of any but a Solar swordsman; even then, it yielded up the totality of its power only to those whose technique and skill equaled its joy in destruction. After it reduced one hundred battlefields to ash in the course of taming Creation and destroying the enemies of the [[Solar Exalted]], [[Volcano Cutter]] was returned to its temple-manse, and there it rests today. Only one being dwells within the artificial volcano-palace—Javarajati, a conjured spirit of earth and flame, who tends [[Volcano Cutter]] in its slumber and seeks the blade out to return it to its cradle when she senses that its current wielder has fallen. She has performed this service five times since the [[Solar Exalted]] passed from Creation, for none who have braved the temple during the Second Age have proved the equal of the weapon they claimed. Volcano Cutter’s hilt features a core of polished white jade striped with orichalcum bands, while the massive red jade blade itself is single-edged, tapering to a curved point, with a second grip mounted at the back of the blade for better control when stabbing or slashing in closequarters, or to more easily plunge the daiklave into the earth and draw it back out. It has two hearthstone sockets, one mounted on each of its grips.
