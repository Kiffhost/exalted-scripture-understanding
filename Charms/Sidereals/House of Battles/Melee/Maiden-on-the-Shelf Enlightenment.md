At the center of perfect clarity, the Sidereal’s inner eye glimpses the mysteries of the cosmos that still lie beyond it — but not beyond her blade. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Sidereal chooses a Sidereal Martial Art. She can learn it without needing the requisite Martial Arts Charms. She can use it with all Melee weapons, though this doesn’t make it compatible with other styles that use them (unless the Sidereal’s also purchases this Charm for them). All her Melee Charms count as Versatile for that style and as Martial Arts for any of its Charms that interact with other styles, like Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form (p. XX). This Charm can be purchased any number of times.
