the Earth’s Beating Heart (White Jade Gunzosha Armor, Artifact §••••) A suit of alabaster-white gunzosha armor distinguished by a single gauntlet of red jade and orichalcum, Seralawi was not among the Seventh Legion’s initial arsenal when it encamped at Deheleshen. Instead, it was the scavenger prince Geshel Reave who discovered it in the Tomb of Ten Thousand. The fragmentary First Age BECOMING A GUNZOSHA Creating the jade amulets necessary for a mortal to attune to gunzosha armor is a major project (Exalted, p. 240) that requires Craft (Artifact). Surgically implanting them is a difficulty 3 (Intelligence + Medicine) roll that inflicts a level of unpreventable lethal damage.
GUNNZOSHA A ZOSHA ANND RESONNANNCE For artifacts such as gunzosha armor that allow mortals to attune them, mortal wielders are considered dissonant regardless of the materials the artifact is made from.
texts he recovered along with it showed how to create and implant the attunement amulets but contained no mention of the toll gunzosha armor took on its wearer.
Geshel entered old age a decade too early, believing his unnatural aging to be some curse left upon the Tomb.
Geshel sought the counsel of many savants to free him of this curse, but it was not until he met Amilar Hakala of Valkhawsen Academy that he learned the truth.
Crushed by this revelation, Geshel offered the armor to Hakala in exchange for a sorcerous working that would restore the semblance of his youth, if not his lifespan.
Seralawi’s design is configured for defense, and the Seventh Legion deploys it to take maximum advantage of its Evocations. Anado Kurun held her dragon’s line against the Tungapi horse archers after their arrows slew the dragon’s kazei. Spindrift Unaki rode with Karal Nevak in the Wyld Hunt against the Hellion Flower and saved the Dragon-Blood’s life from the Fair Folk’s lash of tears. Mizura the Hammer held the Jaguar Pass against Lin the Betrayer’s army with but a dozen soldiers. 
 Evocation Evocations of Seralawi, the Earth’s Beating Heart Seralawi’s wearer lowers the Initiative cost of full defense actions by one point.
