Moonsilver flows across the Lunar’s skin as she solidifies her anima, encasing her in indestructible armor. She creates a shell or carapace that counts as artifact armor (+11 soak, 10 [[Hardness]], −2 mobility). Its soak can’t be reduced below ([[Stamina]]) by effects that ignore armored soak, like Piercing attacks. This armor counts as moonsilver, shapeshifting with the Lunar (p. XX). She may fuse it with any artifact armor she’s currently wearing, enjoying the best of both armors’ traits and applying this Charm’s benefits to her armor. [[Artifact]] armor’s attunement cost is waived for this Charm’s duration, releasing the committed motes. This Charm may be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation to the carapace. These Evocations’ themes and functions derive from the Lunar’s personality, spirit shape, and Caste. With [[Essence]] 3, this Charm’s duration becomes Indefinite. 

## Special activation rules

When the Lunar uses [[Deadly Beastman Transformation]], she may reflexively activate this Charm.
