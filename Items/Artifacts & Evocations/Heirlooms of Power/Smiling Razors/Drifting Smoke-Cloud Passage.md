Soul-Burning Mark The wielder of the [[Smiling Razors]] transmutes her body into drifting smoke, passing through places where she normally couldn’t. She can fit through spaces so tight that only smoke could pass through with a single move action on her turn, and ignores difficult terrain or environmental penalties on the roll. Any tight space she wishes to flow through must be short enough that she could successfully traverse it in a single move action. If she’s in concealment, she doesn’t need to make another [[Stealth]] roll as long as she ends her movement in a location that provides concealment, and she may even rush while in concealment. This Charm may only be used once per day, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with an unexpected attack. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation may not be awoken with experience points. Instead, it awakens at no cost when the wielder kills a nontrivial enemy from ambush. 

## Dissonant

A character dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation.
