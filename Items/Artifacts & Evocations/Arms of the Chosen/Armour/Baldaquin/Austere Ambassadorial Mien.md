While Baldaquin’s wearer and her companions are guests of, or guided by, spirits or the Fair Folk, they gain +1 [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]], so long as they respect the local terms of hospitality. Their host and his retinue cannot attack them without just cause unless the attacker pays one [[Willpower]]. An [[Eclipse]] Caste Solar waives this Evocation’s [[Willpower]] cost.
