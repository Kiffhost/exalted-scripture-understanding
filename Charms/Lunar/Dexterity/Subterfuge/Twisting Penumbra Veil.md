As an enemy lunges at the Lunar, she recedes like evening mist, vanishing into the shadows. To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 12+ and be within short range of a viable hiding spot. She clashes an attack with ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]), ignoring penalties to [[Stealth]] in combat. If successful, she moves up to one range band to enter the hiding spot, and automatically establishes concealment against her attacker. All other onlookers roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against her roll to determine if she establishes concealment against them. This doesn’t count as her move action. If she loses the clash, she doesn’t enter concealment. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive unexpected attack that resets the Lunar’s [[Initiative]]. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]], those [[Merits]] impose their penalty on larger foes’ clashing attack rolls as though they were [[Awareness]] rolls.
