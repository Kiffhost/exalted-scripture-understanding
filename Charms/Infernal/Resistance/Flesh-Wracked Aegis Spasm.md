*The Infernal’s skin shifts with nauseating fluidity, its grasping pseudopods and undulating motions girding her in her brazen mail.*

The Infernal dons a set of armor in (its mobility penalty + 1) rounds (Exalted, p. 591). She gains the Hideous Merit for as long as she wears it. Once she’s donned the armor, its mobility penalty is reduced by one point. Light armor increases its soak by one instead.

Ending this Charm causes the Infernal’s armor to instantly fall from her. She retains the Hideous Merit until the end of the scene.
## [[Keys]]
#### Cancerous Carapace Transformation (Resistance 4) (+2m)
For a two-mote surcharge, the Infernal negates her armor’s mobility penalty entirely, or adds +2 to the base soak of light or medium armor. The armor is immune to any effects that can damage or destroy armor.
#### Devil-Flesh Viscera Aegis (Essence 2, [[#Cancerous Carapace Transformation (Resistance 4) (+2m)|Cancerous Carapace Transformation]])
The Infernal waives the attunement cost of artifact armor donned with this Charm. Her attunement can’t be broken or disrupted by magic.
#### Squirming Flesh Fortress (Essence 2) (+2i)
The Infernal can pay two-Initiative surcharge to use this Charm reflexively on her turn, donning the armor instantly. If she knows [[Viridian Legend Exoskeleton]] (p. XX), she can use it reflexively with this Charm to don its armor.
