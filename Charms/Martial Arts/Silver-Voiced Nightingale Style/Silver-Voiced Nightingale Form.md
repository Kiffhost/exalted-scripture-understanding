*Standing straight and pitching her voice to reach all listeners, the Nightingale begins a song that rings out with exquisite clarity, a melody in perfect synchronization with her every movement.*
This perfect harmony of music and motion adds +1 to her Evasion, while the circular breathing used to maintain her song in the midst of battle adds her [[Performance]] to the raw damage of her withering kiai attacks. Finally, whenever an enemy pays [[Willpower]] to resist a [[Performance]]-based influence roll made by the Nightingale, she gains three points of [[Initiative]]. 
## Special activation rules
Whenever the Nightingale successfully overcomes a non-trivial enemyâ€™s [[Resolve]] with [[Performance]]-based influence relevant to an ongoing fight, she may reflexively activate [[Silver-Voiced Nightingale Form]]. She gains [[Initiative]] from any characters who pay [[Willpower]] to resist the initial influence roll, as described above.
