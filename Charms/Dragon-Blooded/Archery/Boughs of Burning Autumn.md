Flame is born from wood. The Dragon-Blood may reflexively reload a firewand or similar flame weapon with the Slow tag on her turn. This permits her to use it in combination with Charms that make multiple attacks, such as Seven-Year Swarm Volley, as long as she pays this Charmâ€™s cost before each additional attack past the first.
