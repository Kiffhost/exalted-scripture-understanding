*The Lunar’s rage overflows through her bond with her familiar, empowering it with her divine wrath.*
She may pay an additional mote when using [[Guardian Fang Rebuke]] or [[Throat-Ripping Guardian]] to add her [[Initiative]] to her familiar’s to determine its decisive attack’s damage. A successful attack resets her [[Initiative]] along with her familiar’s; on a failed attack, she loses the same amount of [[Initiative]] as her familiar. Such attacks don’t count as the familiar’s action for the round. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar is in the shape of the same animal as her familiar, they both add +1 base [[Initiative]] after resetting on a decisive attack.
