With the one dot ritual the exorcist may attempt to banish a ghost with chanting, ritual gestures, and a variety of mystical appurtenances. She may pay one Willpower to begin an extended action with a difficulty of the ghost’s Essence and a goal number of its Willpower, rolling (Intelligence + Occult) dice at each interval. Each roll is a combat action that cannot be placed in a flurry. She must remain within short range of the ghost she’s exorcising, which takes a -3 penalty on all actions while the exorcism is underway. Success dispatches it back to the Underworld. The exorcist must maintain concentration, and automatically fails if she is damaged by a decisive attack or crashed. 

The two dot ritual allows an exorcist with a specialty in demonology, and with a specialty in knowledge of a specific demon, to drive that demon out of a host, causing spirit to flee into a clay vessel, statue, tree, cattle or other proxy for a month and a day. This ritual’s procedure is the same as that of one to drive out a ghost, save that it uses the demon’s Resolve as a difficulty. A sorcerer who has bound a sealed demon may free it by commanding it out of the containing vessel—if she can find it. 

There is another two dot version of a demonic exorcism that involves forcing a spirit back into its sanctum, but this works for no more than a single night, has a goal number of (the spirit’s Willpower x2), and a terminus of three, after which the same exorcist may not attempt to banish it for a year and a day. 

Exorcists are uncommon, but not extremely so, and tend to be born near shadowlands.
