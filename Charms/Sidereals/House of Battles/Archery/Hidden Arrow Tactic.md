Only as the Sidereal’s foe staggers back to avoid her feint does he notice the second arrow hidden behind it. After a successful distract gambit, the Sidereal can use this Charm to make a decisive attack against her target, which benefits from the distract gambit as well as her ally’s attack. It’s unblockable and undodgeable but is opposed by her target’s (Perception + Awareness). If the gambit was unexpected, this attack is as well. Reset: Once per scene unless reset when an ally benefitting from a distract gambit by the Sidereal damages a crashed enemy.
