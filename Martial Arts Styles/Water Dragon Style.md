# [[Water Dragon Style]]
Water Dragon teaches that all things are flow â€” the rhythm of a fight, the blood of a living body, the [[Essence]] of Creation. Practitioners of this style train in techniques that block, redirect, or impede these flows, subtly manipulating the conditions of battle to seize victory. Its defense emphasizes fluid motions and outmaneuvering enemies with footwork, while its offense relies on repeated strikes, exploiting the lightest wound to unleash a cascading torrent of death. 
## Weapons
Water Dragon unarmed attacks emphasize swift sequences of punches, kicks, and claw strikes. It also uses tiger claws.Unarmed attacks enhanced by Water Dragon [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage.
## Armour
This style is compatible with light and medium armor.
## Complementary Abilities
[[Occult]] is needed to battle spirits.
