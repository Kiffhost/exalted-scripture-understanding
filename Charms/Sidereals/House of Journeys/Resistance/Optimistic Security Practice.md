Reflecting on the sacrifices she may one day be called upon to make, the Sidereal imbues her enemies with her own generosity of spirit. After a withering attack hits her, but before damage is rolled, the Sidereal can imposes a â€“2 penalty on the damage roll. If she has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] or compassionate [[Intimacy|Principle]] applicable to her attacker, the penalty increases to ([[Intimacy]] + 1). If the Sidereal is unarmored, she can penalize decisive attacks.
