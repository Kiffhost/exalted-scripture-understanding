Cathak Falu was never well-loved by her comrades or her commanders in the house legions. She was an adequate but unexceptional officer, never equaling the martial glory of her fellow Dragon-Blooded no matter how doggedly she practiced weapon drills with her daiklave or memorized strategies from The Thousand Correct Actions. Perhaps this could have been forgiven, if not for her lack of social graces, her standoffish demeanor, and her taciturn brooding. She was most comfortable on the battlefield, and spent the rest of her time isolated from the women and men of her legion. Her fellow Dynasts often wondered why she hadn’t been married off quietly and never spoken of again, and rarely cared whether or not she was in earshot of their questions. It was at the Rainbow Scales that Cathak Falu, for once in her life, won the admiration of all in her house. The Dynasty lost a soldier, but the invaders lost a vanguard. House Cathak recovered her blade from the boiling river that had been the Rainbow Scales. Now celebrating the former reject as the pinnacle of soldierly virtue, Cathak elders show the blade called Pyre of Legions to their young heirs in its resting place before Cathak Falu’s tomb, her burning handprint still visible upon its hilt. 

## Evocations of the Pyre of Legions

Falu’s last desperate thoughts were burned into Pyre of Legions when she fell in battle, carved into searing hot jade, and any who wield the blade feel them coursing through their own heart as surely as though they were her own. Its wielder gains a Defining Principle of “I will give anything to protect my comrades” that cannot be weakened or altered so long as she’s attuned to the daiklave.
