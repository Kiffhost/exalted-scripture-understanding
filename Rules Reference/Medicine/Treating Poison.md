Physicians can treat cases of poisoning by administering remedies and antivenins, hoping to neutralize the harmful venoms with their medical skill. Ordinarily, treating a victim of poisoning requires at least an hour and access to appropriate remedies. At the conclusion of the treatment, the physician rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) at a difficulty based on the severity of the poison—common or relatively harmless poison may be only difficulty 1 or 2 to treat, while life-threatening poisons, exotic venoms, and magical toxins might be difficulty 3 to 4. Every [[Dice Rolls#Threshold Successes|threshold success]] garnered on this roll reduces the duration of the poisoning by one [[Poison#Interval|interval]]. Multiple instances of treatment cannot stack their benefits—only the highest reduction of duration is applied.

On the battlefield, there is rarely time to properly treat an ally wounded by a poisoned blade or a venomous monster. A physician can treat an ally for poison as a [[miscellaneous]] action, but doing so adds 2 to the difficulty of the roll, above and beyond any difficulty increases he might suffer for lacking access to proper medical materials.

Example: After being poisoned by the snake-headed scourge of a raksha, Illustrious Aya attempts to treat herself, drawing vials of antivenin and beneficent herbs from her bandolier. While her own (Stamina + Resistance) roll has already reduced the duration of the poison to one round, the (Intelligence + Medicine) roll is made at a steep difficulty: a base of difficulty 2 for the relatively common snake venom, +2 difficulty for rushing treatment with a miscellaneous action, +1 difficulty for not having access to her full supply of medicines and treatments, for a total of difficulty 5. Her (Intelligence + Medicine) succeeds with one threshold success, reducing the duration of the poison to zero and curing her of it.
