A choir of silver-white wraiths surrounds the sorcerer, inciting utter agony with their keening song. This is an environmental hazard against all enemies within short range, with a resistance difficulty equal to the sorcerer’s [[Intelligence]] (use [Stamina + Resistance]) and Damage 2L. Characters who fail the roll lose a point of [[Willpower]], while battle groups instead immediately check for rout. Once the sorcerer has begun the [[Cantata of Empty Voices]], she may sustain it with an unrolled shape [[sorcery]] action taken on each subsequent turn at no additional cost. As she continues the song, its range expands—to medium range on the first subsequent turn, then to long range. Every three turns after that, it expands to cover another range band, until it ultimately spreads to a maximum radius of one mile. At this point, the Storyteller should not make individual rolls for each trivial opponent or hapless bystander caught in the cantata, but simply describe the mass deaths and panicked, fleeing mobs that result. 

A sorcerer who knows [[Cantata of Empty Voices]] as her control spell may maintain it even during [[Initiative]] Crash. As long as she recovers from the crash without being hit with a decisive attack, the casting of the spell proceeds uninterrupted. 
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
Distorting the cantata neutralizes its killing power, converting all damage dealt by it to bashing and preventing it from rolling over to inflict lethal damage. While the enemy sorcerer might be able to inflict wide-scale harm, the spell will not result in death by itself, and recovery will be much easier for its victims.
