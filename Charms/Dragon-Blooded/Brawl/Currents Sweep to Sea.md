The Dragon-Blood reaches through water, shaping it into a flowing torrent that can constrict foes and drag them across the battlefield. As long as there’s a source of water on the battlefield, such as a small pool, cistern, river, or recent rainfall, she creates a grasping limb or tendril of water, rolling a grapple gambit against an enemy at short range. If she wins control of the grapple, her foe is dragged into close range with her. If there’s no source of water to use, she may expend a level of her anima instead. In Water Aura, this Charm’s range extends to medium.
