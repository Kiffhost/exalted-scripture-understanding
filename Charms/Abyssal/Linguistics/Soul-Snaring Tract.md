*The Abyssal prophet’s dread scriptures shatter the minds of those who read them, replacing their delusions and misconceptions with a single, undeniable truth.*
The Abyssal makes an instill roll to create or strengthen a Principle that she has at Major intensity.
Affected characters gain the instilled Principle at Major intensity, or strengthens an existing [[Intimacy]] to Defining. For negative Principles iand Principles that expresses a positive outlook on death, this costs an additional [[Willpower]] to resist for every three extra successes, maximum (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3).
