A master of subtle pestilences, the Lunar besieges foes with plaguebearing envoys. She may use Rabid Beast Bite to transfer a disease with a touch outside of combat. When she infects a character with Rabid Beast Bite or a disease retained with Plague Rat Embodiment, she may delay the disease’s onset by up to (Essence + Stamina) days. During that time, her victim suffers no ill effects, but is still contagious. Diagnosis attempts during this time fail automatically unless enhanced by magic; even then, such rolls are made at +2 difficulty.
