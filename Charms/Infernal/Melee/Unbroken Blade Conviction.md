*The Infernal’s confidence in her own invincibility is all she needs to turn aside the greatest of blows.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after an attack roll against her. She rolls (current temporary Willpower), unmodified by any other effects, and adds her successes to her Parry against the attack, maximum (Essence).
