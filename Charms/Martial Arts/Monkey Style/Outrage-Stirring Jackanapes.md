Blissful sages master countless methods of provocation to sow chaos among their enemies.
The stylist rolls (Social Attribute + [Performance or Presence]) to enrage all enemies who can see or hear her. Until her next turn, whenever an enemy takes a turn without attacking her, she can reflexively make a distract gambit against him, using the initial roll’s successes as her attack against his Resolve. She can also do so against enemies who use magic to reflexively attack someone other than her outside of her turn.
The Initiative cost of all distract gambits made using this Charm is reduced by one. If an Intimacy penalizes an enemy’s Resolve, the cost reduction increases to (Intimacy).

## Mastery
This Charm’s duration is one scene, but it ends if the stylist uses her turn to make an attack. Reflexive attacks don’t end it.


## Special activation rules

The stylist can use this Charm reflexively when she uses Flowing Mirror of Opposition or Monkey Form, or when she succeeds on one of Four Halo Golden Monkey Palm’s gambits.
