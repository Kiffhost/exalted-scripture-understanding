The Lunar’s all-destroying might forces open a gaping vulnerability in her foe’s defenses. She makes a decisive attack with base damage (Essence + 10s on the attack roll), ignoring Hardness. This doesn’t include her Initiative or reset her to base. If she deals damage, her target’s Hardness is halved, rounded down, until he crashes or incapacitates her, or the scene ends. Against enemies with Hardness 0, the Lunar adds her attack roll extra successes as dice of damage on her attack. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 12+ Initiative in a single tick.
