The Dragon-Blood batters her foe like a wave hammering against the shore. She doubles her [[Strength]] to calculate the raw damage of a withering attack, or doubles 10s on a decisive damage roll. In Water Aura, if the Dragon-Blood deals 3+ withering damage or 1+ decisive damage, the onslaught penalty inflicted by her attack doesn’t fade on her enemy’s next turn, but the turn after.
