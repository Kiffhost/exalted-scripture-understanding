*Throwing back her head and closing her eyes tight, the Nightingale shrieks out an awful cry. Glass and crystal shatter spectacularly, metal warps, and enemies bleed from the ears as her devastating crescendo rises to its conclusion.*
[[Resounding Songbird’s Cry]] applies a sonic environmental hazard against all enemies within short range of the martial artist. The hazard has damage 2B and a difficulty of (the martial artist’s [[Essence]] + 2), resisted with ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). Stunting the hazard to destroy scenery such as large stained glass windows, crystal chandeliers, or similar can render the damage inflicted by this hazard lethal. On the turn after using [[Resounding Songbird’s Cry]] to unleash an environmental hazard, the martial artist may use this Charm a second time at no cost to make a withering kiai attack that is dispersed through the lingering sonic resonance of the initial cry, known as the Shattering Echo Refrain. The attack is rolled against all enemies who failed their roll to resist the hazard, and doubles up to (the martial artist’s [[Charisma]]) 9s. 
## Special activation rules
[[Resounding Songbird’s Cry]] can only be used once per fight, unless reset by landing a decisive kiai attack and then building up to [[Initiative]] 10+. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood cannot use the Shattering Echo Refrain.
