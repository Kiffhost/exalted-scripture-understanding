*The Abyssal rules with an iron fist, shaping her subordinates to her vision of the world.*
The Abyssal expresses one of her Major or Defining Intimacies through her leadership of an organization, requiring her to spend a scene engaged with that an organization in a way that supports the [[Intimacy]].
Examples include making a dramatic speech to her followers, promulgating a set of rules, or employing [[Eloquent Example Inspiration]]. All organization members who witness this or hear of it from others intuitively realize the Abyssal’s [[Intimacy]].
This has the following effects:
 - All organization members who are aware of the Abyssal’s [[Intimacy]] gain its benefits as if they had it themselves, but it can’t be leveraged against them with social influence. A character who violates the [[Intimacy]] loses this benefit.
 - The Abyssal adds ([[Essence]]) dice on influence rolls against group members that align with the [[Intimacy]].
 - The Abyssal adds ([[Essence]]) on [[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], and [[Socialize]] rolls against group members to uncover violations of the [[Intimacy]].
If the Abyssal chooses a negative Tie, a positive Tie whose object is dead or undead, or a Principle that expresses a positive view on death, the added dice are non-Charm and this Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes.
The Abyssal can stack this Charm to affect multiple organizations, and can use it up to ([[Essence]]) times on each organization.
With a [[Bureaucracy]] 5, [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a seven-mote surcharge to actually impose the [[Intimacy]] on organization members, rather than only granting its benefits. Characters with positive Defining Ties to the Abyssal when she uses this Charm can’t voluntarily erode the imposed [[Intimacy]]. If such a character has the imposed [[Intimacy]] at Defining intensity, they can treat any influence it opposes as unacceptable. Resisting this influence requires spending three [[Willpower]] for day over (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) different days, after which a character can begin weakening the Tie. The Abyssal can only have one such enhanced use of [[Accursed Overlord Authority]] at a time.
