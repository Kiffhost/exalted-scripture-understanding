*Focusing her [[Essence]] down her spine and through her lower extremities, the Exalt repels the ground with a tremendous leap. The Exalt locks onto an aerial target, whether it be a Haslanti skyship or a [[Stormwind Rider]], leaps toward it and begins to soar.*
This moves her up to two range bands, expending her movement action, and allows her to continue flying one range band through the air on subsequent turns by paying two motes or two [[Initiative]] per turn. Once she is within combat range of an opponent, attacking is sufficient enough movement to keep her airborne. If she is a ranged fighter, she may also use [[Unbound Eagle Approach]], paying two motes in order to hang in the air, planing along an air current as she takes an aim action. Lastly, the Solar can also channel a burst of speed for two motes, allowing her to rush or disengage from appropriate distances. 
If she fails to activate the Charm, gets knocked off-course or otherwise begins to fall, [[Eagle-Wing Style]] cannot be reactivated until she touches down and is able to leap again. [[Eagle-Wing Style]] can be activated at the apex of [[Mountain-Crossing Leap Technique]], in which case it costs only four motes to activate.
