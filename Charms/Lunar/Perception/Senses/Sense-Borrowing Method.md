*Reaching out to an animal’s mind, the Lunar experiences the world through its senses.*
She rolls ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Occult]], or Presence}) against the [[Resolve]] of an animal she can see, unmodified by [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. Success forges a mental link between them. By meditating, she experiences the world from its perspective instead of her own, making [[Perception]] rolls using her own dice pools and [[Charms]], but benefitting from the animal’s sense-enhancing [[Merits]]. Depending on her rolls, she may notice details that it overlooked, or vice versa. She can’t borrow the senses of familiars or magically enhanced animals, except her own familiar. When used on her familiar, she waives this Charm’s cost, extends its duration to Indefinite, and can use it without needing to see her familiar. With an [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Lunar can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to borrow the senses of humans or magically enhanced animals. A third purchase at [[Perception]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, lets her pay this surcharge to borrow the senses of spirits or fae.
