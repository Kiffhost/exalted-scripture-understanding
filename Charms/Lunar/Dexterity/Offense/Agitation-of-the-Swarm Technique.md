*Striking with supreme finesse, the Lunar denies her foe a tactical advantage in the same instant she wounds him.*
After landing a decisive attack that deals 3+ levels of damage, she may forgo one level of damage to either disarm her enemy or unhorse a mounted enemy. With [[Dexterity]] 5, [[Essence]] 5, the Lunar need not forgo damage to include the gambit effect.
