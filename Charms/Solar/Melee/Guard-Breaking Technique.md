The Solar makes a spectacular feint attack that opens her enemy’s guard to an ally’s blow. When using defend other, the Exalt may use this Charm to use a distract gambit (p. 200) to benefit her charge, with double 7s on the Initiative roll. In addition, when her distraction is successful, her charge’s next attack gains (Solar’s Essence or three, whichever is greater) bonus dice.
