The Dragon-Blood’s shadow conceals a secret flame.
When an enemy attacks a duplicate created by Burning Shadow Double, she can pay six motes to detonate that duplicate in a burst of flame as a decisive counterattack, rolled with (Wits + Stealth). If the Dragon-Blood is concealed from the attacker, it’s a surprise attack. It deals (Essence) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. The Dragon-Blood’s Initiative isn’t included or reset to base.
This counterattack doesn’t break the Dragon-Blood’s concealment. Instead, if her attack roll is lower than her current concealment successes, it becomes her new concealment total, and all enemies may roll (Perception + Awareness) opposing it to detect her. If her attack roll is higher or equal than her current concealment successes, then all enemies roll against her concealment successes instead.
The Dragon-Blood may expend her Fire Aura to add her Initiative to the damage roll of a counterattack made with this Charm. Doing so resets her to base normally if the attack hits.
