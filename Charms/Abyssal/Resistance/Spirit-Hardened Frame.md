*Having died once, Abyssals quickly shrug off lesser wounds as inconsequential.*
The Abyssal reduces withering attacks’ raw damage and decisive attacks’ damage dice by two.
Against decisive attacks, the Abyssal also gains [[Hardness]] 4. If she already has [[Hardness]] from [[Flesh Like Marble]] (p. XX) or Transcendent Soulsteel Flesh (p. XX), she can instead add +2 to that [[Hardness]].
