The Siderealâ€™s compassion warms hearts long grown cold from self-denial, weariness, and despair, encouraging them to enjoy the good things in life. When a character is presented with the opportunity to indulge in a sensual or hedonistic pleasure, the Sidereal places him into a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]]. He must cite a Major [[Intimacy]] and spend one [[Willpower]] to resist indulging in it. (As always, the Red Rule lets a player veto her character being seduced or placed in a sexual situation.) If he has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that supports indulging, he must instead cite a Defining [[Intimacy]] to resist. The Sidereal is never perceived as the source of this influence. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by instilling a character with an [[Intimacy]] that supports selfgratification or indulgence and then raising it to Defining intensity.
