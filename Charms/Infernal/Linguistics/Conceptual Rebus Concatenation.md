*The Infernal composes infinite layers of intertwined meaning, so great it can only be written in the true tongue of reality.*

The Infernal uses two Simple Linguistics Charms together in a single text. The text is not written in any language, each luminous sigil a reified signifier of pure meaning that is simply understood. If both Charms require a roll, the Infernal only rolls once, using the lower of the two dice pools. This roll benefits from any enhancements, like bonus dice or double 9s, provided by either Charm.

If both of the Charms the Infernal uses have a Willpower cost, this Charm’s Willpower cost is waived.
