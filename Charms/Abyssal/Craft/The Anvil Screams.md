*The Abyssal pushes her craft to its very limit, drawing dark inspiration from past horrors.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a roll for a major, superior, or [[legendary project]], adding a non-Charm success and rolls ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice.
This Charm’s craft point cost depends on the kind of project enhanced: silver points for major, gold for superior, or white for legendary.
With [[Essence]] 3, the dice bonus increases to ([[Intelligence]] + [[Essence]]).
Compatibility Check [[Charms]] like [[The Anvil Screams]] that specifically enhance [[Craft]] rolls for projects can’t be used with other [[Craft]] rolls, like [[Magnificent Cenotaph Allure]]’s [[influence roll]].
