*Even in the depths of murderous rage, the Abyssal preaches her bleak gospel with bloodied fists and thunderous words.*
While using Dark Messiah’s Wrath, the Abyssal gains +1 Resolve. It no longer prevents the Abyssal from making influence rolls unrelated to combat so long as they inspire despair, sorrow, or other negative emotions, instill Principles that she holds or negative Ties, or leverage such emotions or Intimacies with persuade actions. She adds dice equal to her wound penalty on such rolls, maximum (highest social Attribute). An enemy whose Resolve is beaten by an influence roll one Initiative, even if he resists with Willpower.
