Steed and rider move as one, guided by shared instincts. The Lunar applies one of the following effects: 
-  She reflexively takes a defend other action, protecting her mount. 
-  She reflexively makes a distract gambit on her turn, benefitting her mount. This doesnâ€™t count as her attack, but can only be done once per turn. 
-  With a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her mount, she adds ([[Intimacy]]) to the difficulty of an unhorse gambit against her. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Speed Bonuses, the Lunar can activate this Charm to take a defend other or distract action benefitting her rider, or increase the difficulty of an unhorse gambit against him.
