*Empowered by hate, the Nemesis Cuirass makes its wearer seemingly unkillable.*
The wearer gains +2 armored soak, or ([[Intimacy]] + 1) soak against enemies she has a negative Tie toward.
## Resonant
If the wearerâ€™s soak reduces an withering attack to minimum damage, her attacker loses one [[Initiative]]. If she has a negative Tie toward him, she gains that [[Initiative]].
