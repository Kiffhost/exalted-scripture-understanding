*The sorcerer abides by an esoteric taboo or is victim to a delusional belief inspired by the Wyld energies inside her mind, a Defining [[Derangement]] which cannot be removed or altered.*
If she works her delusions or taboo into the description of a [[Stunt]], she gains sorcerous motes equal to the stunt’s rating. If she is stunting the casting of her [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Control Spell|control spell]], add two to the bonus. These motes last until the next time she sleeps, and can be spent towards any spell she casts. If the [[Derangement]] causes in-character hardship that would be sufficient to gain solar experience from the [[Flaws|Flaw]], she gains 10 sorcerous motes, which last for the duration of the story. After the first time this bonus is awarded in a story, subsequent awards are lowered to the sorcerer’s ([[Essence]]).
