This chain shirt of green jade links — treated with the mystical inks certain far-Eastern barbarian tribes use to camouflage themselves with occult tattoos — is worn atop a hooded tunic of soft black velvet, made with silk spun by rare worms that inhabit deep places beneath the Imperial Mountain. Completing the set is a pair of bracers made from the stripped bark of ironwood trees, carved with symbols representing Sextes Jylis and Mela, with a hearthstone socket set in the left bracer. Midnight Thorn was forged by the DragonBlooded artificer Iselsi Uja, and was among the arsenal of artifacts House Iselsi employed in their disastrous rebellion against the Scarlet Empress. She stripped it away from the House and bestowed it on her elite spies, the All-Seeing Eye. Its last known bearer, sent by the Empress herself to infiltrate Lunar bases on the Caul, wore Midnight Thorn to conceal him in the jungles, but he never returned to report his findings, and the armor was presumed lost.
