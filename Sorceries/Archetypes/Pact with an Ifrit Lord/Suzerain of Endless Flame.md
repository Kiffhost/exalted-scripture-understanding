Fire answers readily to the sorcerer’s will. Whenever the sorcerer casts a spell that creates or manipulates fire as its primary effect, or summons a fire elemental, its cost is lowered by three sorcerous motes. If it’s her [[Sorcery#Control Spell|control spell]], she may also waive a single point of [[Willpower]] from its cost once per day.
