*Moving faster than the eye can see, the Lunar interposes herself between her ward and his attacker.*
When she uses [[Ferocious Guardian Beast Stance]], her defend other action extends to short range. When her ward is attacked, she may pay two [[Initiative]] to move one range band toward him, if this brings him within short range. This doesn’t count as her move action. If the Lunar protects her Solar mate with this Charm, she regains its [[Initiative]] cost if she parries an attack against him or the attacker targets her instead of him. 
## Protean 

In flying animal forms, the Lunar may ascend one range band vertically after moving to protect an ally with this Charm.
