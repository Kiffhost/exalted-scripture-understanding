The Sidereal and her chosen enforcers impose discipline through fear, working her crew hard without a single complaint. The Sidereal can use this Charm after she or a subordinate acting under her orders imposes disciplinary measures on a member of a group the Sidereal holds direct authority over — her ship’s crew, soldiers under her command, etc. She makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [[Sail]]) threaten roll against all group members. Affected characters suffer the following: 
-  They can’t protest or complain about the Sidereal or their working conditions. No matter how much they resent her, they won’t speak out. This doesn’t prevent acts of disloyalty, only expressions of discontent. 
-  Quitting their job requires entering a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and citing a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] to spend three [[Willpower]]. 
-  They suffer −1 [[Resolve]] against the Sidereal’s persuade and threaten rolls and those of characters acting on her orders. 
-  If the Sidereal uses [[Ship-Commanding Attitude]] against them, they’re treated as having a Major [[Intimacy]] supporting her influence rather than a Minor one. A character who upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] of courage, recklessness, audacity, or anger by challenging the Sidereal’s authority is freed from this effect.
