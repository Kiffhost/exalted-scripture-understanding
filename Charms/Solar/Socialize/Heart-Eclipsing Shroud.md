*The Exalt creates a new persona with a set of false [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] she can use to change the way she thinks and acts.*
These [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] are purchased as a permanent effect, but the Solar must activate them by taking a dramatic action lasting four or more hours, in which she cloisters herself in a place of solitude and meditates or talks herself into her new persona. Upon entering her new persona, she gains her new [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] and temporarily voids her true [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], and gains the following benefits: While this Charm is active, the Solar can act against her true [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] without eroding them or having to roll to gain [[Limit]] at the end of a scene. Furthermore, the Exalt cannot be impressed or persuaded by her true [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]—as if she were another person. The Solar may use her persona’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] to void social influence against her, but doing so causes her to drag the affected [[Intimacy]] or [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] into her next persona change, or back to her true set of [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], resulting in confusion as her identities begin to overlap and she begins to think competing thoughts in different voices. [[Heart-Eclipsing Shroud]] can be purchased ([[Essence]]) times, to create ([[Essence]]) personas. Motes spent activating this effect are not committed: reverting to her true [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] or changing to another persona requires that she use the Charm again.
