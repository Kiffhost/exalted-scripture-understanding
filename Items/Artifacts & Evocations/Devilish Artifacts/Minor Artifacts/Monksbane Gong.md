The Lunar Rakehell Cadhla delighted not only in defeating Immaculates in battle, but in subverting the faithful. Where monks preached denial and self-control, Cadhla taught their followers the arts of seduction and bade them spread her cult of revelry. Termagant Reed was the most famous of these disciples. He loved Cadhla dearly, and when a Wyld Hunt slew her, his grief drove him to seek out Alveua, Keeper of the Forge of Night. He entreated the demon to make of him something that might cause the Immaculates to feel some semblance of his devastating loss. She forged him into a gleaming black gong with an inscription etched in silver: “To catch a bird is to cage the sky.”

When attuned for five motes, the gong’s music creates a spiritual aura that negates prayer. It can be struck to create an eerie, mournful sound, audible out to medium range, and continues to reverberate for a full day unless stilled. Its master can strike it with a difficulty 3 (Charisma + {Occult or Performance}) roll for a thunderous ring that can be heard for (1 + extra successes, maximum 5) miles away.

As long as the gong continues to reverberate, characters who can hear it and have a Resolve lower than the gong-ringer’s successes can’t hear prayers or benefit from the Cult Merit, nor can their prayers reach anyone else. After (Essence) consecutive days of exposure, such characters must weaken an Intimacy related to faith, religion, or spirituality, or form a Minor Intimacy reflecting antipathy toward such things if he has no such Intimacies.

Spirits recognize the gong’s sound as antithetical to prayer. If the gong suppresses prayers from a spirit’s cult, he can tell some magic has disrupted their worship.
