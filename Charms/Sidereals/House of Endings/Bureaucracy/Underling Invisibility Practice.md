Those who think themselves above the Sidereal are those most vulnerable to her, so blinded by their hubris that they don’t notice her until it’s too late. The Sidereal is overlooked by characters whose Intimacies reflect feelings of self-importance and superiority to her: a Tie of contempt toward her, a Principle like “Things would be better if everyone listened to me,” and the like. Such characters can’t notice her or anything that would directly indicate her presence, like an ally’s warning. A character with a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] of compassion, humility, or self-doubt can spend one [[Willpower]] to resist this. This Charm ends if the Sidereal takes an overt action, including Joining Battle or blatantly displaying supernatural power.
