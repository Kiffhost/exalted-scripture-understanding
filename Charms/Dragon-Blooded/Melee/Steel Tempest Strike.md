*The Exalt leaps into the air and rides a current of wind to strike at her foe with deadly speed.*
On her turn, she may use her movement action to advance one range band towards an enemy at short range and make a decisive attack against him. She ignores difficult terrain, and may skim over chasms or pits as long as she ends on solid ground. This doesnâ€™t count as her attack for the round. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 15+ [[Initiative]] in a single tick.
