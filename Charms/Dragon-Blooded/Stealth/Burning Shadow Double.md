The Dragon-Blood radiates her presence through the shadows as a heat mirage, distorting the air to create a near-perfect double of herself, tinged with glowing hints of her anima. To use this Charm, she must be in concealment. She may place a decoy at any point within medium range. The decoy is realistically lifelike and can appear to take most actions the Exalt could, as determined by her, but cannot speak, make sounds, or touch anything, and has no scent. It can’t move beyond medium range from her, and vanishes if she moves further than medium range from it. The decoy has [[Defense|Evasion]] ([[Manipulation]]) against attacks, and dissipates into nothingness once struck. Against attacks made from short or close range, its [[Defense|Evasion]] falls to 0. As long as it isn’t hit, it continues to convincingly imitate the Dragon-Blood, though it cannot take combat actions. Once a character comes within short or close range of the decoy, he may roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) opposing (the Dragon-Blood’s [[Manipulation]] + [[Stealth]]) to realize the decoy is a sham, and can warn his allies not to attack it. Magic such as [[Keen Sight Technique]] (Exalted, p. 267) allows characters to make this roll at any range. In Fire Aura, the Exalt may create up to ([[Essence]] + [[Manipulation]]) separate decoys with each use of this Charm, paying two motes for each additional mirage.
