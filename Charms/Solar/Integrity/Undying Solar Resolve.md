*Through adversity the Lawgiver finds power.*
Whenever a character tries to socially influence the Solar, use magic on her that would mentally control her, curse or change her nature, the Exalt gains one mote for every 1 and 2 in the initiate’s roll (if applicable). Motes gained through this Charm can only be used on [[Charms]] from social Abilities and vanish at the end of the scene.
