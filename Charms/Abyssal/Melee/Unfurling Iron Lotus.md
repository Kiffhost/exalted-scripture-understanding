*The Abyssal’s weapon moves like a flickering shadow, unleashing a cascade of blows as beautiful and brief as the petals of a blooming flower.*
When the Abyssal’s withering attack reduces an enemy’s [[Initiative]] from being higher than her own to lower than it, she can use this Charm to reflexively make a withering or decisive attack against that enemy.
With a [[Melee]] 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, once per scene, the deathknight can treat her [[Initiative]] as 3 higher to determine whether she can use this Charm.
