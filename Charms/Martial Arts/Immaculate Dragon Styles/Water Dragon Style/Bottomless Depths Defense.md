*The martial artistâ€™s body ripples and deforms around a blow, dispersing its force into the bottomless abyss of her vitality.*
She rolls (Essence + Stamina), unmodified by other effects, with each success cancelling a level of decisive damage. Even if she rolls no successes, she still cancels one level of damage. This Charm must be declared before the attack is rolled. 
The Immaculate may pay one Willpower and expend her Water Aura to negate all damage from the attack. 
## Reset
This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset by being hit by three decisive attacks from nontrivial foes without taking a single level of damage.
