*Death’s Lawgiver speaks with the authority of eternity, her every proclamation as unassailable as the grave.*
The Abyssal gains the following benefits:
 - Characters can’t use negative Ties toward her, her allies, or a group she belongs to bolster their [[Resolve]] against her influence or resist it in [[Decision Points]].
 - Against mortals and [[Essence]] 1 ghosts, the level of [[Intimacy]] needed to justify her persuade rolls is lowered by one step (Exalted, p. 216). Against trivial characters, it’s lowered by two steps  - She adds ([[Essence]]) to her [[Defense]], [[Guile]], and [[Resolve]].
 - If an enemy initiates hostilities, she and her allies add (her [[Essence]]) automatic successes on the [[Join Battle]] roll.
 - Any decisive damage that would fill her Incapacitated health level is negated. She loses this protection while crashed.
This Charm ends if the Abyssal or any of her allies take hostile action, even in self-defense. She can’t reuse it for the rest of the session. Even if she ends the Charm, any such hostile action during the same scene will prevent her from reusing it.
