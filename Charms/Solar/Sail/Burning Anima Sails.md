Anima burning with righteous condemnation, the Lawgiver casts her blazes into the air, igniting her sails in a pennant for the world to see. The Exalt’s anima must be at the bonfire level to use this Charm. The moment the Solar activates this Charm, her iconic anima crawls up the mast, rendering it invincible to all damage for an instant. If the sails are still flying, her anima crawls over them, suffusing them and igniting them in a massive display that can be seen for (Essence * 5) miles. If the sails are gone, the Lawgiver’s anima flies in their place, restoring the ship’s sail-based speed. While the Burning Anima Sails are flying, the ship is supernaturally terrifying to demons, the undead, and other benighted creatures from the recesses of Creation. All naval maneuvers attempted by such creatures suffer a dice penalty equal to half the Lawgiver’s Essence, rounded up. In addition, any creatures of darkness who board the Solar’s ship suffer a -1 penalty to all actions. Using this Charm drops the Solar to the dim anima level. When the Charm ends, the iconic anima dissipates, leaving the ship’s fabric sails perfectly restored, even if they were completely destroyed.
