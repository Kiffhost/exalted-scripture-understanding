*The Sidereal knows what happened better than those who were present.*
When the Sidereal hears a character describe an event he’s personally witnessed, an experience he’s had, or new knowledge or techniques he’s developed, she disputes his assertion and explains her expert opinion of the matter. This is a special (Manipulation + Lore) instill roll against everyone who hears her, ignoring multiple target penalties. Any penalties she suffers for making implausible claims are doubled (Exalted, p. 215).
If the Sidereal’s roll beats the speaker’s Resolve or that of anyone else he’s shared that information with, their memories are altered to match the Sidereal’s view of things, as if things had occurred exactly as she said. If there are any gaps in her proposal or inconsistencies with a victim’s own knowledge, he unconsciously fills in those details or contrives explanations.
If an affected character uncovers evidence that contradicts his altered memories, he can pay three Willpower to resist this influence, restoring his altered memories.
If he has a Tie of trust or respect for the Sidereal, he must enter a Decision Point and cite an Intimacy of equal or greater intensity.
Against other targets, this influence instills a Principle of belief in the Sidereal’s claim, like a normal instill roll.
They can resist as usual for such influence.
With an Essence 4 repurchase, the Sidereal no longer needs someone to make a claim before she can use this Charm. Referencing a viewpoint or text that relates to one of her Lore backgrounds, the Sidereal presents a refutation. A character whose Resolve is beaten has his memories warped as above. As with this Charm’s base effect, she’s still limited to opinions on individual events or experiences, not broad-ranging claims.
## Reset
Once the Sidereal uses this Charm on a character, she can’t use it against him again for (his base Resolve) days.
