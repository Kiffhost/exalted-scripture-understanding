The Lawgiver may use this Charm to sort an organization she controls, moving personnel and dropping its weakest members. This Charm may be used after Bureau-Rectifying Method to instantly cleanse an organization of any hostile magic such as Indolent Official Charm or astrological curses. Whether the Solar is able to determine the presence of such magic depends on the thoroughness of her investigation. If the Storyteller is satisfied that she has uncovered evidence of malignant forces at work, this Charm automatically succeeds at clearing all such effects and making the organization immune to them for one season.
