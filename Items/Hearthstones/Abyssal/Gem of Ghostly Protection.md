Within three miles of the stone, phantoms harass anyone who does not live within the area protected by the stone and who attempts to harm or steal from anyone living inside this region. These ghosts are immaterial and are only active between dusk and dawn. However, during that time they can create spectral forms to scare or distract outsiders that shout or howl and throw small objects that cannot do damage but are extremely distracting. In addition to making stealth impossible, the ghostsâ€™ attentions increase the difficulty for all actions by the invaders by 2. Invaders cannot hide from these ghosts using mundane stealth, but any [[Charms]] or other abilities that allow characters to hide supernaturally prevents the ghosts from noticing them.
