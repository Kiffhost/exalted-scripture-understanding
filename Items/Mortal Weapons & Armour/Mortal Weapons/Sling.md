Slings are small pouches with thongs attached to either side. A stone or metal sling “bullet” is placed in the pouch, and the sling is swung in a circle at high speed, hurling its projectile at great velocity. Slings are inexpensive and can use any rock of approximately the correct size as ammunition, but they are less accurate than bows. By taking an additional aim action before firing, this weapon’s range can be extended to long for one attack. This aim action provides no benefit beyond enabling long-range attacks.
