*The Infernal deftly steps aside as a foe lunges for her, letting him stumble down the path of his damnation.*

The Infernal adds a free full Excellency to her Evasion against an enemy who’s at his base Initiative or lower. If her enemy is crashed — either before he attacked her, or as a result of her defensive Charms — he’s banished into the Endless Desert. He can return to his original location with a five-day journey, though (Wits + Survival) rolls may be needed to navigate the shifting sands.
