*This Evocation enhances Battle Anthem (of the [[Solar Exalted]]), [[Soul-Stirring Cantata]], and Heroism-Encouraging Ballad (Exalted, pp.*
365-366). She may manifest the Charm through the shield instead of her voice, transforming its harmonics into song, allowing her to sustain it without having to use her own action, at a cost of two Vibration per round. While the shield is performing one of the above songs, the Exalt doubles 9s on rally or rally for numbers rolls for an allied demonic battle group.
