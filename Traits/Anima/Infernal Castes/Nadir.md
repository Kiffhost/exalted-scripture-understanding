The Yozis will never escape Hell. The Exalted made of Malfeas a prison that no power in the cosmos can breach, a prison to hold the Yozis until the end of eternity. They have resigned themselves to this captivity, abandoned all hopes of freedom — all save the Ebon Dragon, who labours in eternal futility. Who can say which is more piteous? It might be the greatest insult of all, that they should be defined by their imprisonment.

The Yozis seek their [[Nadir]] Castes among others who are prisoners. They care not for laws or morality, making no distinction between persecuted innocents and cold-hearted murderers. The [[Nadir]] Castes receive an offer of freedom — freedom from their bondage, and freedom beyond mortal imagining. Never again will a chain or prison hold them. They could be criminals, slaves, prisoners of war, political hostages, those held against their will or still scarred by their
imprisonment. For others, the imprisonment is metaphorical — a cruel family’s overbearing expectations, religious vows, a loveless marriage, crushing debt, or strictures of class or caste.

Chainbreakers are peerless in stealth, unseen by their pursuers. They cannot be constrained, escaping all restraints by deft trickery or brute strength. They are swift beyond compare, whether outpacing would-be captors on foot, riding behind enemy lines by night, or weaving through blockades at sea. Such skills find many uses in Creation, whether as an assassin, spy, smuggler, or master thief. Some find personal vengeance isn’t enough. They might turn their blades against those who subject others to the same imprisonment, undertake covert ventures to free others held in bondage, or work in the shadows to sabotage the institutions of imprisonment. They need not share the Yozis’ indifference for innocence, though some may eschew conventional morality as yet another prison.

Hell is bittersweet for [[Nadir]] Castes. They mourn, for it is the place of Yozis’ eternal imprisonment; they rejoice, for it is the place where they were set free. Demons prize their services as agents of intrigue, espionage, and assassination, while others turn to them to make perilous journeys in pursuit of wonders or riches. Some [[Nadir]] Castes prize the chance to hone their skills under a demonic patron’s tutelage: learning theft from Erembour, shipcraft from Florivet, or the wicked arts of Mara.
# Caste Mark
An empty green ring, with a gap on the bottom enclosed by two small green vertical slashes.
# Anima Banner
Streaks of red light whirl within the green flame of a [[Nadir]] Caste’s [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Levels|anima banner]]. They’re rarely accompanied by any sound, though they might bring an eerie hush instead. Some smell like clean, fresh air — albeit the air of Hell — while others evoke the scent of road’s dust or the saltwater sea.
# Iconic Anima
The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]]; shattered chains that trail behind the Infernal from manacles of anima around her wrists; a prayer wheel of spinning knives; a guillotine stained with the blood of gods; a wolf-headed battering ram; an eerie fog filled with strange, inhuman shadows; a heaped hoard of bloodstained treasures.
# Anima Effects
A [[Nadir]] Caste’s anima lets her evade restraints and confinement, conceal her supernatural power, and enter her Devil-Body to escape imprisonment.

In addition to the default [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Effects|anima effects]], [[Nadir]] Castes can perform the following:
- **Devil-Shroud Subtlety** (2m; Reflexive; Instant; Mute): The Infernal mutes all motes spent in an instant.
- **Gaol-Sundering Juggernaut Rampage** (Permanent): The Infernal can enter her [[Devil-Body]] when she makes a meaningful attempt to escape from imprisonment or confinement and fails.
- **Never Caged Again** (5m; Reflexive; Until next turn; Mute): The Infernal gains +1 non-Charm [[Defense|Evasion]]. Rolls to restrain or confine her in any way suffer a penalty of (higher of Essence or 3) dice. This includes both the attack roll and control roll of a grapple gambit against her. This power’s cost is waived at [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Levels|bonfire anima]].
# Caste Abilities
[[Nadir]] Castes choose their Caste Abilities from [[Athletics]], [[Awareness]], [[Dodge]], [[Integrity]], [[Larceny]], [[Ride]], [[Sail]], and [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth|Stealth]].
# Sobriquets
Princes of the Shattered Prison, the Unfettered, Chainbreakers, Basalt Wolves, Daggers of Hell
# Concepts
Assassin for the revolution, charismatic outlaw, fugitive from justice, heretical ex-monk, liberator of slaves, outcast scion of a controlling family, political dissident, pirate captain, reformed con artist, wanton killer.
# Experience Trigger
Escaping from literal or metaphorical imprisonment or helping someone else do so; upholding a Major or Defining Intimacy through infiltration, surveillance, or subterfuge; defeating an enemy who’s imprisoned or restrained the Infernal or someone she has a positive Tie toward; overcoming legal or geographical obstacles that impede her or her Circle’s goals.
