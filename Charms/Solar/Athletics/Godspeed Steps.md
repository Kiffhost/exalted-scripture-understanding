The Exalt projects herself forward on a pulse of Essence, faster than a heartbeat, moving like a blur. The Exalt may attempt a rush against an opponent up to three range bands away. If successful, she flashes out in a burst of speed, and flashes in at close range to her target that same instant. This Charm removes the flurry penalty for an attack made after a rush. If used in conjunction with Racing Hare Method, the Exalt can rush an opponent up to four range bands distant.
