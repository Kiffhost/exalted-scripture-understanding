Marshaling puissant legions of beastfolk or other supernaturally empowered troops, the Lunar forges daring plans of attack. She adds non-Charm dice on a Strategic Maneuver roll equal to the highest Might of any allied battle group. If she stunts with a description that invokes her soldiers’ superhuman capabilities — carrying out an Ambush stratagem at night while leading beastfolk capable of seeing in darkness, or leading a flank of aquatic demons in a Pincer Attack from the sea — she adds non-Charm successes instead. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a Stamina Charm.
