Taking a deep, measured breath, the martial artist draws the flickering aura of power around her tight against her skin. Impenetrable White Shroud adds (2 + [current halos x2]) to the soak of any armor the martial artist wears. If she is unarmored, she instead adds (3 + [halos x3]) soak, and gains (halos x2) hardness. In addition, battle groups do not add their Size to the raw damage of attacks made against her.
