This is a brilliant orange orb which seems to be filled with slowly billowing tongues of flame. When socketed into an attuned artifact, the owner may pay one mote upon falling asleep to send the point of recovered Willpower that she regains during her rest into the hearthstone rather than gaining it herself. At any later point, she can pay another mote to retrieve and spend this stored Willpower point.
The Sphere of the Revolutionary Dog can only hold one Willpower point at a time.
