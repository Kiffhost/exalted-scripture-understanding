Accepting whatever may come, the Sidereal escalates a battle to its climax in a pivotal exchange of blows. When an enemy makes a decisive attack against the Sidereal, she can use this Charm, rendering her Defense inapplicable against it. She makes a decisive counterattack before the initial attack’s damage roll, adding damage dice equal to her attacker’s extra successes — and preventing him from using his own extra successes for any relevant effects, like Hungry Tiger Technique (Exalted, p. 351). Each level of damage dealt by the counterattack also inflicts a −1 penalty on the initial attack’s damage roll. If the Sidereal incapacitates her attacker, he doesn’t roll damage. Although the Sidereal can’t use her Defense, she can still clash the attack. She can use Crimson Palm Counterstrike to do so, despite the usual restrictions on Clash and Counterattack Charms; her Initiative doesn’t reset until both attacks are complete. Reset: Once per scene unless reset by crashing a nontrivial enemy whose Initiative was higher than the Sidereal’s.
