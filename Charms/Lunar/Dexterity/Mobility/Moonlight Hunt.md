*Embracing protean fluidity, the Lunar urges her body to speed beyond all limits.*
The Lunar dramatically increases her [[Peregrine Speed]]; what would take her a week with that Charm’s normal speed can be completed in a day, a day’s journey in a few hours, and an hour’s journey in ten minutes. This applies when one of the following conditions is met:  - She’s traveling to someone she has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward, or who has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her.
 - She’s traveling to her Solar mate.
 - She’s pursuing someone as part of a [[Sacred Hunt]].
 - She’s traveling within her territory (Lunars, p. 176).
