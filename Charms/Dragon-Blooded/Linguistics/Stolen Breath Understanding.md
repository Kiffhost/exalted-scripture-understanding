Drinking in a person’s breath, the Dragon-Blood steals his voice. She rolls ([Manipulation or Wits] + [[Linguistics]]) against the [[Resolve]] of a character within close range to breathe in his exhalation. If successful, she draws out his fluency in a single language, gaining the ability to speak and comprehend it as per LanguageLearning Ritual for ([[Essence]] + extra successes) days.
She suffers no penalties on influence rolls made with that language, speaking with the accent and dialect of the character she stole it from, and can mimic his voice flawlessly.
This Charm’s victim doesn’t lose fluency in the chosen language, but his voice is unnaturally quiet whenever he speaks in it, imposing a –3 penalty on any spoken influence rolls he makes in that language. He can reclaim his stolen voice by breathing in the Dragon-Blood’s exhalation while at close range. This requires a difficulty 6 gambit in combat, but can potentially be achieved outside of combat through social influence, [[Larceny]], or other means.
With [[Linguistics]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Dragon-Blood may steal up to ([[Intelligence]]) languages with a single activation, committing an additional two motes for each language past the first.
