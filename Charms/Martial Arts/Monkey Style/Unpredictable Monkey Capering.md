*Taking advantage of an enemy’s misstep to tumble beneath his legs or spring over his head, the stylist moves into position for an unexpected strike.*
The stylist gains +1 Defense. Successfully defending lets her maneuver into her attacker’s blind spot: If she makes a gambit against him on or before his next turn, it becomes a surprise attack, inflicting −2 Defense.
## Mastery
The stylist can use this Charm after the attack roll.
