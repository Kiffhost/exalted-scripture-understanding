Merits are special features that add distinction to characters. Some Merits are physical advantages (such as Strong Lungs), while others represent specific learned aptitudes—additional languages the character knows how to read and speak are a common example. Still other Merits may represent social advantages, such as great wealth.

In addition to personal quirks and aptitudes, Merits also represent unusual supernatural features and capabilities. The most common source of such “Supernatural Merits” is the transformative power of the Wyld—a gift few seek. Other individuals might gain such features through divine parentage, sorcerous experimentation, or the blessings (or curses) of the many spirits of Creation. Supernatural Merits may offer great power, but those which obviously twist the mind or body also bring suspicion and hatred from the majority of Creation’s residents, who fear the mad touch of the Wyld. 

Each Merit has a number of dots (•) associated with it. These dots represent the number of points that must be spent to purchase the Merit. Some Merits allow for a range of dots (• to •••, for example). These allow players to purchase a low or high rating as appropriate—and often to raise low ratings over time during play. 

All Merits can be purchased with Merit points or bonus points during character creation. After character creation, Merits fall into three categories, governing how they may (or may not) be obtained during play. Certain magical phenomena (especially the mutating power of the Wyld or sorcerous projects) might occasionally violate these rules, as described below.

Some Merits have attached *drawbacks*—weaknesses or limitations inherent to their use or possession.

# Innate

Innate Merits can only be taken during character generation, with Merit points or bonus points. They can only be gained during play through some form of magical intervention—it’s impossible to simply decide to cultivate such Merits. 

# Purchased

In addition to being purchased at character creation as normal, these Merits may be purchased or advanced for (new rating x 3) experience points during play. You don’t have to pay for ratings that don’t do anything, and so Boundless Endurance (••) would cost 6 experience, not 9. Purchased Merits with variable ratings must be bought in sequence. 

# Story

Once play begins, these Merits may only be obtained or advanced through the course of the story, at the Storyteller’s discretion—Allies, for example, cannot be purchased with experience points, but must be gained through roleplaying and social influence. 



# Supernatural Merits 

These Merits bestow supernatural capabilities, and may generally only be obtained by magical means. The most common source of supernatural Merits in Exalted is exposure to the Wyld. Few seek out such power, both due to the unpredictability of the Wyld’s blessings, and because of the extreme stigma attached to obvious Wyld mutation throughout Creation.

These Merits are primarily presented to represent the warping power of the Wyld, and to aid Storytellers in putting together beastfolk, Wyld mutants, or similar characters. It’s very uncommon for individuals with such Merits to experience Solar Exaltation, but not unheard of. Characters can only begin play with supernatural Merits with explicit permission from the Storyteller.
