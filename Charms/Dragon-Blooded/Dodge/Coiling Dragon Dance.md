Subliming her presence into shadow and smoke, the Dragon-Blood dares her foes to strike her. She gains one [[Initiative]] when she successfully dodges an attack, and adds her [[Defense|Evasion]] to her soak against withering attacks she attempts to dodge. If a withering attack hits her but deals no damage, it counts as her having dodged it. Additionally, when using [[Flickering Candle Meditation]] or [[Bonfire Shadow Evasion]], she counts her attackersâ€™ 2s as well as 1s, although the maximum remains unchanged.
