*Exaltation, Unweaving Method Presenting a warrant of Heaven’s reproval, the Sidereal demands that a possessing spirit take up refuge elsewhere.*
The Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Occult) against a possessing spirit’s Resolve to exorcise it. If successful, the spirit is expelled and can’t possess that character again until the next new moon. Enemies of fate lose one Willpower.
If the Sidereal knows Terminal Sanction (p. 300), she can inflict any of its effects on an exorcised spirit as though she had slain him.
With an Occult 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a five-mote surcharge to drive away spirits that aren’t possessing hosts. If successful, the spirit immediately dematerializes and must flee the Sidereal’s presence. This costs two Willpower to resist; enemies of fate can’t do so until the scene ends. Enemies of fate with Essence less than or equal to the Sidereal’s are driven to return to their home realms and can’t resist until they’ve spent a day traveling there or reached it.
The Sidereal can also pay this surcharge when using this Charm on a possessed character, driving away the possessing spirit if she successfully exorcises him.
