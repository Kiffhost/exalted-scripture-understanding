Rylo Stormsong was prone to expend her firedust profligately, so she and [[Sirrush]] learned to make do with the dregs of wind and fire. If the wielder hasnâ€™t reloaded [[Sirrush]] after attacking, she can activate this Evocation to coax a blast of scorching air from the weapon. This is a difficulty 3 gambit that, if successful, knocks the target down and back one range band. On a successful gambit, she may reflexively aim at that enemy.
