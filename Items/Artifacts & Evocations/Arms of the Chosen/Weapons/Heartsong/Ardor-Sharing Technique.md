Words and arrows alike convey the Exalt’s ardor. The wielder can supplement a passion-inciting gambit or inspire action with this Evocation if she is in the throes of the same emotion that she seeks to evoke, adding a bonus success to the attack or inspire roll. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with jade, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she upholds a Major or Defining Intimacy based on a strong emotion.
