With a single cut, the past is rewritten.
The wielder makes a special false memory gambit.
The consequences of any actions she takes within that memory persist throughout all memories thereafter. If the wielder kills an enemy’s mother, she will remain dead in his memories of subsequent events. Likewise, if the memory establishes that something occurred in the past, memories of previous events change to reflect that event having occurred.
This Evocation can potentially alter vast swathes of an enemy’s life. Changes generally focus on the direct consequences of the wielder’s actions, and on any indirect consequences that have a significant impact on the victim’s Intimacies. For instance, if the wielder inserts a memory of her killing a victim’s mother, he might lose all memory of his beloved wife, to whom his mother introduced him. At the Storyteller’s discretion, the wielder may perform more extensive or precise changes by increasing the gambit’s difficulty by 1-3.
Affected characters can still spend [[Willpower]] to temporarily recover memories, but doing so only restores their memory of a single scene, not all of their changed memories. The Psyche effect counts as a Defining [[Derangement]] for magic capable of healing them.
If the wielder uses [[Heartfelt Memory Feint]] to enhance this gambit, it instills a Major [[Intimacy]] that reflects the person he would have become had the false past been true, like a Tie of grief to a slain mother. It can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]].

## Special activation rules
The wielder can use [[Cutting Reminiscence]] reflexively with this Evocation, applying its effect to the gambit.
## Dissonant
Characters who are dissonant with [[Fond Remembrance]] can’t awaken this Evocation.
# FALSE MEMORIES [[Evocations]] like [[Shattered Mosaic Reconstruction]] that refer to false memories only include those the wielder has created with [[Fond Remembrance]], not any other magic.
