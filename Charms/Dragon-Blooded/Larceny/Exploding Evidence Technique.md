Such is the fire behind the Dragon-Blood’s crimes of passion that any investigator that pursues her risks being burned. She makes a conceal evidence roll, rolling a non-Charm bonus die for every 10 that appears, and suffuses the hidden evidence with Fire Essence. If a character attempts to case the scene and fails, the evidence catches fire, exposing him and anyone else on the scene to a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage (Essence)L. This conflagration all but obliterates any evidence remaining at the scene, increasing the difficulty of any subsequent rolls to case the scene by (the Dragon-Blood’s Essence).
