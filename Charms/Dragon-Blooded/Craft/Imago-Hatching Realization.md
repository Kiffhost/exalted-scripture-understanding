Cultivating the [[Essence]] of her work as though it were a living thing, the Dragon-Blood guides its growth from raw materials into a fully realized whole, letting the project flourish in accordance with its own strengths. She undertakes a [[Craft]] project, and may reroll all dice that show non-1 failures on a single roll of that project. If this increases the successes on the roll, the project manifests a single unexpected but useful feature determined by the Storyteller. A longbow might have the perfect composition to also function as an exceptional flute; a river-spanning bridge might attract local honeybees to build hives underneath it. The Storyteller might choose to hold off on determining this quality, instead revealing it later at a dramatically appropriate future time. On an artifact, this introduces a new but related theme from which [[Evocations]] can be drawn â€” the Exalt might discover that a white jade daiklave she forged to slay raksha also has an unexpected proclivity for controlling cold iron through magnetic force. This Charm can only be used once per story. The Exalt may reset it by spending one white craft point, though she can still only use it once per project.
