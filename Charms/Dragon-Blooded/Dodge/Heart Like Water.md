*Light as air, fluid as water, the Dragon-Blood flows around hostile force with infinite grace, letting her enemy defeat himself.*
After successfully dodging a decisive attack, she turns it back on her attacker, rolling a decisive counterattack with ([[Wits]] + [[Dodge]]). All [[Charms]] that the attacker used to enhance his original attack also apply to this counterattack at no additional cost.
If it hits, it uses the attackerâ€™s [[Initiative]] to determine damage (before he loses any due to missing), and resets him to base [[Initiative]], not the Dragon-Blood.
The Dragon-Blood can enhance this counterattack with any Water Dragon style [[Charms]] she knows, regardless of the Ability it was originally made with.
This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with an attack redirected either by it or by [[Safety Among Enemies]].
