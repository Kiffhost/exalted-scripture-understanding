The Childe of Midnights Unremembered is a creature of countless lies, gestating within dreams and delusions.
When the wearer makes an influence roll to lie about the Childe of Midnights Unremembered’s identity, history, or agenda, the cost to resist is increased by one Willpower. Affected characters automatically fail any rolls against the wearer’s Guile that would contradict the lie for the rest of the scene.
Against fae, this Evocation can enhance any lie the wearer tells.
## Dissonant
This Evocation doesn’t increase the Willpower cost of resisting against non-fae.
## Resonant
This Evocation can contest lie-detecting magic like Judge’s Ear Technique. Such contests are resolved by opposed rolls, with the wearing rolling (Manipulation + the Ability used to make the influence roll) with (Essence) bonus dice. If successful, her statement appears true.
