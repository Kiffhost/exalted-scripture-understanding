After a few hours or days out in public, the Sidereal is assured to find at least one person chosen by the Storyteller who’s willing to retain her services as a courtesan, mistress, domestic servant, or similar position that places her in a position of both submission and confidence. The Sidereal may specify a general description for an employer: merchants, gods, Immaculate monks, etc. Alternatively, she can empower such a position she already holds. As long as the Sidereal maintains this position and spends significant time interacting with her employer over downtimes, she gains the following benefits: 
- People want what they can’t have; she gains a bonus dot of [[Appearance]], which can raise it above 5. It doesn’t apply against her employer. This doesn’t apply on threaten rolls if she’s [[Hideous]]. 
- She gains +2 [[Guile]] against rolls that would reveal something that’s been confided to her or that could embarrass her employer. 
- She can [[Introducing a Fact|introduce facts]] with ([[Manipulation]] + [[Socialize]]) about matters concerning her employer’s community, profession, private affairs, or philosophy.
