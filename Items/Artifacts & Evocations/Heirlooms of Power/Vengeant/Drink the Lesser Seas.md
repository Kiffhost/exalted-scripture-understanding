Vengeant’s attack tears away flesh while drinking deeply of the water in its victim’s body, leaving nothing but desiccated skin and bone. To use this Evocation, the wielder must be in concealment. She makes a decisive attack against an enemy who’s unaware of her, adding (Essence) dice of damage and doubling 10s on the damage roll. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial despised opponent. 

## Resonant

Against a despised opponent, the wielder doubles 9 on damage rolls.
