*The wielder intertwines a mote of Ligier’s light with the burning proof of her own authority, infusing them into an arrow that testifies her supremacy over all sorcerers and demonkind.*

The wielder’s attack adds +2 raw withering damage or one die of decisive damage for each of the following that’s true:
- She benefits from aiming.
- She’s successfully beaten her target’s Resolve with a threaten action in this scene.
- Her target is a demon.
- Her target has gathered sorcerous motes or disrupted one of the wielder’s spells this scene, or has any sorcerous motes stored.

If her attack deals 3+ decisive damage, 5+ withering damage, or crashes her target, her arrow explodes in a burst of green-gold flame, engulfing the target and those around her. This is a one-time environmental hazard out to short range of the original target, with difficulty 5 and Damage 4L/round, which only affects enemies. It affects dematerialized spirits, and demons cannot roll to resist .
### Resonant
The wielder may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to expand the hazard out to medium range.
