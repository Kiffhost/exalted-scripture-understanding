*The Abyssal’s words are haunted by shades of subtle meaning meant for a select few.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses one of this Charm’s two techniques: Insidious Undertone Trick, which conveys hidden meaning through speech, or Unwritten Word Apparition, which does so in writing.
Depending on which technique she uses, her speech or writing contains a hidden message that can only be understood by its intended recipients. For writing, she must be familiar with the intended recipients.
Each use of Insidious Undertone Trick lets the Abyssal conceal a few simple statements or a single complex statement, while Unwritten Word Apparition can conceal a message up to half as long as the document it’s hidden within. Obscured writings can be uncovered by magic like Paltry Enigma Dismissal, but such effects cost an additional Willpower and have a minimum difficulty of (Abyssal’s Linguistics). Effects that are normally unrolled require a (Perception + Linguistics) roll.
The Abyssal can repurchase this Charm to learn the second technique.
