Roaring with her draconic ancestors’ fury, the Dragon-Blood exhales a deadly blast of fire. She rolls an unblockable decisive attack with (Charisma + Presence) that extends in a line out to medium range, striking all characters caught within it, including allies. The attack roll is also treated as a threaten roll against all enemies caught in the blast to terrify them into fleeing, even if they successfully dodge. The Dragon-Blood divides (her Initiative + Essence) evenly among all hit characters, rounded down, to determine the lethal damage rolled against them, ignoring Hardness. Battle groups caught in the blast suffer (Initiative + Essence) damage, which doesn’t count against the total Initiative she has to divide, and must roll against rout (Exalted, p. 209) if their Resolve is beaten. Any flammable scenery in the area of the blast catches fire. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 15+ points of Initiative in a single tick.
