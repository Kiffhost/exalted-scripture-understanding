*Giving herself over to obsession, the deathknight scorns those who would distract her from her poor, wretched favorites.*
The Abyssal gains +2 non-Charm [[Resolve]] against [[Social Influence|influence]] that opposes the Tie from [[Passion-and-Obsession Puppet]]. She can treat it as a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] for Abyssal [[Charms]] if that’s advantageous to her.
While using [[Shadow Behind the Mirror]], the Abyssal also gains +1 non-Charm [[Resolve]] against influence that opposes one of her victim’s Major or Defining Intimacies. This doesn’t stack with the bonus above.
