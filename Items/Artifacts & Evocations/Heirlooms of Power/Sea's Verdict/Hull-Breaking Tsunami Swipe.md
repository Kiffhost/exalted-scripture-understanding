All castles are built on sand. When attacking, the wielder unleashes a crashing wave of force, reflexively rolling a feat of demolition (Exalted, pp. 229) with (Sea’s Verdict’s anima x2) bonus dice to destroy an object in her opponent’s range band that’s not being carried. This can reduce cover (including full cover) before the attack is resolved. 

## Resonant

The wielder adds (Sea’s Verdict’s anima) to her [[Strength]] rating to determine what feats of demolition she may attempt.
