The Solar’s voice is mighty and can be heard for long distances. This Charm allows the Lawgiver’s speech to be heard up to extreme long range. Even in a city riot, the Solar’s voice can be heard above the din. While her mighty voice reverberates, she is only capable of inspire and threaten actions, but ignores all penalties from environment, distance, or group influence to do so. She may always choose to lower her voice and speak normally while using this Charm, and must do so in order to use other forms of social influence. This Charm may also be used shape the Lawgiver’s voice into a weapon, blasting into the target of her ire with a single explosive utterance. This use of the Charm costs six motes, one [[Willpower]], and has a duration of Instant. Roll a full free [[Charisma]] + [[Performance]] excellency decisive attack with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes. This attack can only be parried or dodged with magic. If it hits, the target is flung wildly backwards one range band and lands prone, taking one automatic bashing damage. For every three extra successes on the attack, the target is flung an extra range band up or backwards, taking one automatic bashing damage for every level they are flung. If they impact with a solid surface they do so explosively, taking falling damage equal to number of range bands they were thrown minus one. This attack does not use the Solar’s [[Initiative]] for damage, but resets the Solar’s [[Initiative]] to base.
