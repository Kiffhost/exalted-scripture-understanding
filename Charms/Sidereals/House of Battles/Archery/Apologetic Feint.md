The Sidereal’s quick wits win the day, harrying foes with well-placed shots. The Sidereal reduces the Initiative cost of a disarm, distract, or unhorse gambit by one, or that of a custom gambit enhanced with Generalized Ammunition Technique. Any reduction of the attack roll’s target number also applies to the Initiative roll.
