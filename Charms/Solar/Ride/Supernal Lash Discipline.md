The Lawgiver holds the reins of Heaven and rides with the skill of divinity. Her skill allows her to draw supernatural levels of performance from her chosen steed, doubling its Speed for the scene. If this Charm is used without Flashing Thunderbolt Steed, mortal mounts will almost surely perish at the end of the scene. Used in conjunction with this Charm, the mount will still be tired and need to rest at the scene’s end. This Charm ends if the Solar is crashed.
