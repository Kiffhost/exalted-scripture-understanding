Beasts and vermin bedevil trespassers on the Lunar’s domain. She rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) within a territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]]. When unwelcome characters travel through her territory, one of them must, on the group’s behalf, roll ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) opposing her roll for each week of travel. Failure indicates that a member of the group will suffer an automatic botch on an [[Athletics]], [[Investigation]], [[Medicine]], [[Sail]], [[Stealth]], [[Survival]], or [[War]] roll made outside of combat that week, due to interference by native wildlife. A botched foraging roll might mean that vermin eat whatever supplies a character gathers; a botched [[Investigation]] roll might mean that a passing grizzly has eradicated all evidence; a botched Strategic Maneuver roll might mean troops are too demoralized and fatigued by pervasive mosquitoes to execute their general’s plan. Only actions undertaken in the Lunar’s territory can be affected. Additionally, failure inflicts a week-long −4 penalty on all influence rolls that members of the group make targeting the territory’s animals and on [[Survival]] rolls to tame them. A character using magic like Friendship With Animals Approach (Exalted, p. 409) is immune to this penalty; this doesn’t extend to his companions. Once a group has suffered (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) botches from this Charm, they’re immune to further botches until end of story, though rolls to influence or tame animals can still be penalized.
