*The Abyssal’s predatory focus discerns subtle scents that linger like the shallow breaths of the slow-dying.*
The Abyssal’s sense of smell lets her reflexively discern how many people are present within the same room or similar space as her, or within medium range in combat. This includes characters who’re hidden from her, potentially revealing that an enemy is hidden somewhere within range.
For each character within this Charm’s range, the Abyssal can discern what general category of being they are: a human, an animal, a spirit, a zombie, etc. If she detects the scent of someone she’s encountered within the last day or had extensive past experience with, she identifies him automatically.
With [[Awareness]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal can always detect dematerialized characters by scent.
