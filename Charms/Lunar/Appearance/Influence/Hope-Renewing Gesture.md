*The Lunar reaches out to those taken in by cunning deceptions or sweet-sounding words, reminding them of who they really are with a dramatic display.*
The Lunar makes an ([[Appearance]] + [[Presence]]) persuade roll to overturn influence (Exalted, p. 221) as she makes a dramatic physical display to catch her target’s attention. She might brandish a symbol of something he’s forsaken, strike an inspiring heroic pose, toss him a sign of her favor, shoot a [[firewand]] into the air, slap him across the face, etc. Appropriate stunts may let her substitute another Ability for [[Presence]].
The Lunar doesn’t subtract her target’s [[Resolve]] from her [[Appearance]] to determine how many bonus dice she adds, and rerolls all dice that initially show failures. She doesn’t need to spend [[Willpower]] to attempt the roll. If her target cites a Defining [[Intimacy]] or a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the Lunar, the [[Willpower]] cost to abandon the course of action is reduced by one [[Willpower]].
Using this Charm on the Lunar’s Solar mate always succeeds, without needing a roll. If he abandons his course of action, both he and the Lunar lose [[Limit]] equal to (the [[Intimacy]] of the highest positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] either of them has to the other).
With [[Essence]] 4, this Charm can overturn Psyche effects based on fear, despair, or sorrow, even if they aren’t usually susceptible to being overturned. The target never needs to spend [[Willpower]] to resist.
