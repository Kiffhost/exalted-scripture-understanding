The [[Resolve]] trait represents a character’s mental solidity and strength of will, her ability to resist being influenced by the persuasion and manipulation of others. A character’s [[Resolve]] rating is the difficulty for any influence roll made against her. [[Resolve]] is calculated as the character’s ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]] + specialty / 2, round up). If a character is applying her [[Resolve]], then it means she’s resistant to or skeptical of the influence being applied—there’s no need to roll against a character’s [[Resolve]] if she’s happy to accept whatever influence is being offered. **Resolve is mainly used to resist [[Instill]], [[Inspire]], [[Persuade]], [[Bargain]] and [[Threaten]] actions**
