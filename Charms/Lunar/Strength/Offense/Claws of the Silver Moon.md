*The Lunar’s rage cannot be constrained, erupting as a silver nimbus that forms deadly claws of [[Essence]].*
In human shapes, her unarmed attacks or another natural weapon gain artifact weapon traits (Exalted, p. 594) and deal lethal damage; in animal shapes, she enhances a single natural attack with +1 [[Accuracy]], +3 damage, and Overwhelming ([[Strength]]) on withering attacks. She may pay three motes to add ([[Brawl]]) non-Charm dice on feats of demolition using the enhanced attack. Upon changing shapes, she chooses a new natural weapon to enhance. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced with this Charm generally aren’t compatible with [[Martial Arts]], although specific attacks may be compatible with individual styles at the !!Storyteller’sdiscretion—e.g.,rendingtalonsmightbeused!! with styles that use tiger claws. This Charm may be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation to the Lunar’s !!claws.TheseEvocationsdrawtheirthemesandfunction!! from the Lunar’s personality, spirit shape, and Caste. 

## Special activation rules

When the Lunar uses [[Deadly Beastman Transformation]], she may reflexively activate this Charm.
