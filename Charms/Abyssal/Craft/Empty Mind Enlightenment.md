*Emptying her mind of distraction, Death’s Lawgiver unleashes subconscious nightmares to guide her craft.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Perfection of Bleak Design]] on a [[Major Project|major]], [[Superior Project|superior]], or [[legendary project]], she adds a non-Charm success for each failed die that’s rerolled into a success.
If a rerolled die shows a 10, or a number that the Abyssal’s doubled with [[Void Demiurge’s Art]], she adds an additional non-Charm success.
