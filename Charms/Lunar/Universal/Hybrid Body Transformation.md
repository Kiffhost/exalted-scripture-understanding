*The Lunar shifts into hybrid form, combining her human self and her spirit shape.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, her player chooses six dots of mutations reflecting her spirit shape. While in her true human form, she may use this Charm to gain all the chosen mutations. This doesn’t count as being in an animal form for Protean [[Charms]]. Players can freely describe the visual appearance of their Lunars’ hybrid forms — their features might be purely animalistic, like a tiger’s head or dragonfly wings, or indirect reflections of a spirit shape, like multiple arms for a spider or an articulated neck for a giraffe. Players can include purely cosmetic traits, like changed skin color or animal ears, that aren’t represented by mutations.
