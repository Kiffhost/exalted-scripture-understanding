The Sidereal evades unpleasant situations by deciding she was never there. The Sidereal rolls (Wits + Dodge) at a difficulty of (3 + rounds this scene), or difficulty 4 outside of combat. She suffers a penalty equal to the number of nontrivial enemies within medium range of her; if she’s in a battle group’s space, she also suffers a penalty equal to its Size. If the Sidereal succeeds, she disappears, reappearing in a nearby location of the Storyteller’s choice. All characters present in the scene forget the Sidereal was there. If there’s any physical evidence that could identify the Sidereal, her successes are treated as a conceal evidence roll to obscure it. This can be resisted with magic that specifically protects against memory-altering Psyche effects. If the Sidereal knows Trouble Reduction Strategy, she can bring willing characters within close range with her when she uses this Charm, paying an additional five motes per character. Reset: Once per scene.
