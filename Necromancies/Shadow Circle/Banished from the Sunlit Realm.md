*The necromancer taints her victim’s soul with a resonance that violently clashes with the spiritual timbre of Creation. His appearance grows shadowed, his eyes white and wide, his flesh burning under the sun’s light. Only darkness offers relief.*
The necromancer twists the soul of a target within short range, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) against the victim’s [[Resolve]]. Success renders him a creature of darkness and causes him to suffer a −1 penalty to all rolls while in Creation from the disharmony in his soul. This penalty worsens to −3 under direct sunlight as his flesh begins to burn, inflicting a die of lethal damage each minute he spends exposed, or each hour, if he conceals his skin completely. Damage caused by sunlight doesn’t heal naturally.
Should the victim retreat to the shadowlands or exile himself to the Underworld, he finds relief from these effects, though he must avoid exposure to sunlight while in a shadowland to do so. The penalties fade, and damage caused by the spell can be healed naturally. The necromancer may reach into the target’s chest to draw out the curse as a squirming organ of shadow and crush it to end the effect. If the necromancer is slain, the curse is broken.
## Control
The necromancer may sense the direction and distance to her victim, gaining (his [[Essence]]) non-Charm bonus dice to track him. She may also reflexively suppress the curse’s effects at will, allowing her to use it as leverage when threatening her target. The sun’s light feels unpleasant on the necromancer’s skin; if she does not already count as a creature of darkness, she becomes one.
## Distortion (15)
Distortion must occur within short range of the target. Success relieves the effect for (distorting necromancer’s [[Essence]]) days.
