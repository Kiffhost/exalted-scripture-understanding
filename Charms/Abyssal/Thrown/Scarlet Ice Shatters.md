*Razor-edged shards of ice splinter from the deathknight’s weapon as it cuts through her foe’s innards, exploding outward in a gory mist.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after landing a decisive attack against an enemy afflicted with Frozen Prayer Entombment. She can end that Charm’s penalty to add an automatic success on the damage roll and can add up to (higher of Essence or 3) successes total by canceling stacked penalties from multiple uses. If the attack was an ambush, she doesn’t have to end the penalty to add damage.
