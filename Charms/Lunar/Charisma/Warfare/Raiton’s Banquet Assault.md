The Lunarâ€™s ferocious [[Essence]] surges across the battlefield like an endless roar, urging her warriors to deliver death-dealing blows. When she makes a [[Charisma]]-based order directing a battle group to attack, in addition to adding to the attack roll, every two successes on the order roll rerolls a failed die on the damage roll. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by ordering a battle group to make an attack that incapacitates a nontrivial foe or causes an enemy battle group to lose [[Size]]. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
