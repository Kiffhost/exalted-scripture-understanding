The waters around Conquering Tide churn as the lawless are drawn toward the warship on currents of their own misdeeds. When a ship makes a roll to outrun Conquering Tide in a pursuit (Exalted, p. 244) or for a Concealment, Escape, or Positioning naval stratagem, the captain can inflict a (higher of Essence or 3) penalty on that roll. If the enemy ship carries a character whom she believes has committed a crime that opposes one of her Intimacies, this subtracts successes instead of dice.
If Conquering Tide’s captain is in regular combat aboard Conquering Tide or an enemy ship that she’s boarded (Exalted, p. 245), this Evocation can impose a −2 penalty on a movement action taken by an enemy aboard that ship, stirring the waters to rock the ship slightly or calling up wind and seaspray to distract him. If she believes the penalized foe has committed a crime that opposes one of her Intimacies, this subtracts successes instead of dice.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens at no cost when the captain enters naval combat or a pursuit with Conquering Tide against a ship carrying a character whom she believes has committed a crime that opposes one of her Major or Defining Intimacies, or when she Joins Battle against such a character aboard Conquering Tide or a boarded ship.
## Resonant
While in combat aboard Conquering Tide or a boarded ship, this Evocation can penalize attack rolls.
