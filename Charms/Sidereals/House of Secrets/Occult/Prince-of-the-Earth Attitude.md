*Assuming the glory of the Chosen, the Sidereal’s presence commands deference and cows the weak-willed.*
While using [[Incite Decorum]], as long as the Sidereal openly presents herself as an Exalt or acts as her audience would expect one to act, all un-Exalted characters count as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of awe to her and are subjected to the restriction on interrupting or attacking her. [[Incite Decorum]] still imposes Ties of respect or fear rather than awe on spirits. While using [[Mark of Exaltation]], spirits also count as having Minor Ties of awe.
