*Swirling a stardust-wreathed finger through the weave of fate, the Sidereal creates a reverberation that sends foes flying.*
The Sidereal can disengage without moving as long as an enemy is within close range. If an enemy fails his opposed roll, his player determines whether he’s knocked back one range band or falls prone. They don’t cross the intervening space; their location is simply redefined by fate. Until the Sidereal’s next turn, affected characters must pay two [[Initiative]] to rise from prone or move back into close range.
