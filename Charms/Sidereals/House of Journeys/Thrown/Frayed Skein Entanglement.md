*Unspooling a length of an enemy’s fate, the Sidereal pulls them about as she pleases.*
The Sidereal makes a (Strength + Thrown) grapple gambit against an enemy within medium range. Her Defense isn’t penalized, and she can flurry normally while grappling. If she subsequently throws her enemy, she sends him flying two range bands horizontally in any direction.
Against enemies of fate, the Sidereal instead binds them with a chain of golden stardust. Any target number reduction to her attack roll also applies to the Initiative and control roll.
