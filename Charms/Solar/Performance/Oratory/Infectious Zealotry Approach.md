*The Lawgiver distills all the power and passion of an entire speech into a single statement, striking her target with an all-consuming fiery ambition.* 
When the Solar perceives a character who is about to put off making a [[social influence]] attempt that the Solar believes should be attempted now, she may use this Charm, rolling a ([Charisma or Manipulation] + [[Performance]]) based action against her target’s [[Resolve]]. The Solar inveighs against inaction and scorns all dereliction. If successful, her feverish contagion of will causes the target to forget all other concerns, goals, and ambitions, focusing socially on a single social objective for the rest of the scene. This effect can be resisted by paying one [[Willpower]], but the affected character may only pay this [[Willpower]] if confronted by some circumstance that would force him to abandon a Defining [[Intimacy]] in order to carry out his [[social influence]] action. 
### Sidebar
In [[Presence]], the Charm [[Mind-Wiping Gaze]] (p. 372) momentarily blanks out a character’s mind, erasing his social impetus. If used in combination with [[Infectious Zealotry Approach]], the character is rendered catatonic unless attacked. In this state, [[Hypnotic Tongue Technique]] (p. 372) or [[Memory-Reweaving Discipline]] (p. 363) may be used on the target without a [[Resolve]] check.
