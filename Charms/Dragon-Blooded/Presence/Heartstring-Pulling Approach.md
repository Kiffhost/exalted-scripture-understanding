The Dragon-Blood speaks directly to her listener’s emotions, stoking the flames that burn within his heart. She adds a non-Charm success on a Presenceor [[Socialize]]-based influence roll with a single target. If the target’s [[Resolve]] is lowered by a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] based on passionate emotion, the cost to resist the influence increases by one [[Willpower]].
