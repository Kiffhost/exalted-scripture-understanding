*No one outcheats a cheater.*
Whenever a character the Dragon-Blood can perceive attempts to cheat in a game or use the [[Larceny]] Ability, she may read intentions with ([[Perception]] + [[Larceny]]) against the perpetrator’s [[Guile]]. Success reveals the identity of the perpetrator and the nature of his misdeed. On a failed roll, she’s aware that some wrong doing has occurred, but not who did it or what it was. Disguises don’t trigger this Charm, unless the Dragon-Blood witnesses a character disguising himself.
