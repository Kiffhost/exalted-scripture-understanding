The Solar invokes the power of the unbeheld other, her Solar [[Essence]] flaring. Roll ([[Wits]] + [[Medicine]]) and add the successes to the Exalt’s mote pool, even if this would temporarily increase the size of her pool. In addition, add any 10s she rolls to her temporary [[Willpower]], even if this would increase her [[Willpower]] past 10. Finally, for the duration of the scene, every 10 the Exalt rolls on a [[Medicine]] action restores a mote of [[Essence]], until she fails to roll at least one 10. If she knows [[Healer’s Unerring Hands]], she may avoid breaking her trance through use of that Charm. The majority of the motes and [[Willpower]] generated by this Charm must be used on [[Medicine]] actions. [[Healing Trance Meditation]] can be used once per story, but may be reset by paying three experience points.
