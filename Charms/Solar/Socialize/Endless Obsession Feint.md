This Charm embodies the awe-inspiring resonance of the [[Solar Exalted]], whose very presence shapes the flow of nations.
This Charm is triggered by a Solar’s success in a social scene, where through social influence she achieves a significant objective. She might broker an alliance, arrange a wedding, cancel an assassination or convince the local [[Guild]] to decrease opium production. Any objective success she attains at the expense of another social actor in the scene leaves that character in a state of obsession. The Lawgiver is an enigma, and though he can’t remember the substance of her arguments, her casual wit haunts his dreams. For ([[Essence]]) days the character suffers a -2 dice penalty to all [[Bureaucracy]], [[Craft]], [[Investigation]], [[Linguistics]], [[Lore]], [[Occult]], [[Performance]] and [[Socialize]] rolls, with 1s on these rolls each counting as -1 success. When this obsession wears off, the target automatically develops a positive or negative [[Intimacy]] for the Solar, depending on how the days went. This effect may apply to multiple characters in the same scene.
