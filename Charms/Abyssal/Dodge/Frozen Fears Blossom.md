*Fed by ennui and misery, the seeds of despair blossom into frozen flowers.*
When an enemy with a Principle instilled by [[Gracious Gift of Despair]] or a similar [[Intimacy]] attacks the Abyssal, she adds +1 [[Defense|Evasion]]. If she successfully dodges, his despair crystallizes into shards of ice around his heart, dealing (lower of [[Intimacy]] or Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) dice of lethal decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This counts as a counterattack.
A damaged enemy suffers a –1 crippling penalty on physical rolls from chill within. The penalty from multiple uses of this Charm stacks.
