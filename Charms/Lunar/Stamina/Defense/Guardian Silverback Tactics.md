The Lunar guards her pack, covering for openings in their defenses and holding off foes.
The Lunar can use this Charm after a withering damage roll against an ally within close range, redirecting up to (higher of Essence or 3) points of damage from him to her.
If the Lunar’s protecting him with a defend other action, the attacker doesn’t gain Initiative from the withering damage transferred to her. If she uses magic that extends the action’s range, it applies to this Charm as well.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has a special ability or Merit that enhances the defend other action may learn this as a Dexterity Charm, with Bending Before the Storm as its prerequisite.
