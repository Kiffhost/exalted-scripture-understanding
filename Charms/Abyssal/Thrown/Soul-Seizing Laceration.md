*The deathknight’s foes inch ever closer to despair with each blade that strikes true.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after crashing an enemy with a withering attack. He loses one [[Willpower]] and suffers −2 [[Resolve]] for the rest of the scene. While crashed, he increases the cost to resist the deathknight’s influence by one [[Willpower]].
