The Sidereal is convinced that she has foreseen every possibility and planned for every contingency, unwilling to believe that she’s capable of making mistakes or errors in judgment. She rationalizes away failures and mistakes and refuses to accept any occurrence she hasn’t anticipated, dismissing it as something other than what it seems. She also exhibits a selective memory, remembering the past in a selfserving fashion that omits any errors on her part.
This ends if someone for whom the Sidereal has a positive Major or Defining Tie succeeds on an influence roll to show the Sidereal how her decisions have harmed him.
