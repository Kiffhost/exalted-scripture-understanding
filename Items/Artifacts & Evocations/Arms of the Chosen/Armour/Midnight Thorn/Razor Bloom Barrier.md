Opening her palm and feeding Essence into the bracer bearing Sextes Jylis’ sigil, the wearer creates a flower. She may use this Evocation once on her turn to throw such a flower to a point at close range, where it grows into a bush or shrub in seconds. This counts as light cover (Exalted, pp. 198-199). Once this Evocation ends, the razor blooms wither into nothingness. An Essence 3 repurchase upgrades flowers to briar walls, providing heavy cover. An enemy that attempts to take cover behind it or use it as concealment for a Stealth roll suffers (Essence) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness, from the thorns. 

## Resonant

Midnight Thorn’s wearer may reflexively roll to take cover behind her Razor Bloom Barrier with (higher of Stealth or Survival) bonus dice.
