This polished, asymmetrical hand mirror was carved from Szoreny’s silver bark, scoured free of blemish in Cecelyne's sands, and bound in cold-forged brass. Anyone who glimpses her reflection within sees something she doesn’t like, such as a hint of fear that offends her courageous Principles or a resemblance between herself and a hated foe. Writing viewed in the mirror’s reflection becomes incoherent, incidentally protecting observers from any Psyche effects or similar magic contained in the writing.

Attuning to the mirror costs three motes. Mortals can attune to it for one Willpower, which they can’t regain while the mirror is attuned. By holding the mirror and looking within it, an attuned character may roll (Appearance + Larceny) as a miscellaneous action and to change her appearance. Each success lets her change one major feature: skin colour, hair colour or length, height, voice, facial structure, body hair, body shape, sexual characteristics, etc.. These features can be far outside the norm for the user’s species (e.g. giving a human blue skin or a tapir-like trunk), but it can’t add or remove limbs, grant mutations, or impose similar alterations. It can’t replace all of her features: she must always keep at least one major feature of her true self.

This transformation lasts one hour, but can be extended by spending successes on time instead of additional features. Each success spent adds one hour to this duration. Changes revert prematurely if the user ends her attunement.
