The Lunar has honed her powers of self-division and duplication to perfection.
The Lunar gains the following benefits when she uses [[Ant-and-Starfish Trick]]:  - She can create replicas of forms that she isn’t currently in.
 - She can use [[Ant-and-Starfish Trick]] to create replicas that are truly independent of her. She doesn’t need to commit motes or stay within range of them, but independent replicas don’t have an imposed [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty.
 - Non-independent animal replicas count as her familiars. If she knows Blessed MoonBeast Empowerment or [[Erudite Beast-Mind Expansion]], they gain those Charms’ benefits for free.
 - If she knows [[Inchoate Self Realization]], its cost is reduced by five motes and one [[Willpower]] when she uses it to trade places with a duplicate, revealing that it’s actually been her all along. If a roll is necessary, she adds a free full Excellency.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] may learn this as a [[Manipulation]] or [[Wits]] Charm.
