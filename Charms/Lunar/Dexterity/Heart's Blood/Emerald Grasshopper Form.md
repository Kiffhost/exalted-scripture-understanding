The Lunar compresses the fullness of her divinity into the humblest of forms. She changes into an animal shape she possesses with the Minuscule Size Merit. 

## Special activation rules

If the Lunar uses this Charm to shift from one Minuscule Size form to another, she waives its cost. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Minuscule Size may learn this as a Wits Charm.
