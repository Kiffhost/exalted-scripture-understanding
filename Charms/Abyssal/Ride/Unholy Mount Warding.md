*The deathknight’s steed draws strength from its bond with her.*
While the Abyssal is riding or within close range of her mount, it adds (her [[Essence]]) dice to the raw damage of its withering and decisive attacks, and can pay one [[Initiative]] to reflexively protect the deathknight with a defend other action. Doing so grants it +1 [[Defense]], maximum 5, until its next turn.
