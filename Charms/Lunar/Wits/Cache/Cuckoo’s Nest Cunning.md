*Always one step ahead, the Lunar ensures her allies have exactly what they need while depriving her foes of the same.*
When using [[Magpie’s Nest Resourcefulness]], she may swap the introduced object with a mundane item on the person of an ally within medium range, describing how she made the exchange. With [[Essence]] 2, she can use this Charm against enemies as a special disarm gambit. Instead of an attack roll, she rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Larceny]]) opposing her target’s ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll. Outside of combat, this only requires this opposed roll, not a gambit.
