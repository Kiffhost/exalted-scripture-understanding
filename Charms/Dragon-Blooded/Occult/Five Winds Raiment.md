*The Dragon-Blood’s anima banner twists into a whirlwind as [[Essence]] gathers in her hand, shielding her from all harm.*
This Charm supplements a [[Shape Sorcery]] action (Exalted, p. 465). The winds grant her +1 [[Defense]] and ([[Essence]]) [[Hardness]] until she casts the spell or stops shaping. In Air Aura, this doesn’t count as a Charm bonus, and the [[Hardness]] granted rises to (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Stamina]]).
