Eyes flashing with mischievous foxfire, the Lunar incites dangerous obsessions. She rolls (Charisma + [Performance or Presence]) against one character to inspire fascination for a particular good or service — Varangian cuisine, a certain tailor’s clothing, a mercenary company’s work, etc. Success inflicts the Obsession Derangement (Exalted, p. 169) at Minor intensity, fixated on that good or service. Her victim suffers −1 Resolve against bargain rolls offering it to him, in addition to the Derangement’sResolvepenalty.TheDerangementfades after (6 − target’s Integrity) days, but this duration resets if he fails a Willpower roll against the Derangement. This Charm can only be used once per scene. With a Charisma 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Lunar can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to make the Derangement contagious. When an affected character talks with others or enjoys the object of his obsession, he involuntarily makes a special ([Appearance or Charisma] + [Performance, Presence, or Socialize]) inspire roll against all who hear or see him, slipping his obsession into conversation or radiating delight as he enjoys it. The victim isn’t aware of his influence, although his player can enhance it with Charms. Affected characters gain the Obsession Derangement, as above, although it isn’t contagious for them.
