*The Dragon-Blood overcomes poison through mastery of her bodyâ€™s own internal cycle of elements, channeling [[Essence]] inward to cleanse herself of poison or disease.*
She may use this as an Air Charm against inhaled poisons, as a Fire Charm to burn disease from her body, or as a Water Charm against poisons transmitted through food, drink or weapons. Regardless of aspect, she doubles 9s on the roll to resist. 
With a Resistance 5, Essence 3 repurchase, if the Dragon-Blood rolls enough successes to completely negate the duration of a poison, she may pay one [[Willpower]] to expel it at an enemy within short range as an unblockable attack, either exhaling a great gout of venomous gas or smoke, or driving poisons from her pores in a liquid burst. She rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) against his [[Defense|Evasion]], exposing him to the poison if successful.
