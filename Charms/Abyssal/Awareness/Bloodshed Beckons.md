*Her senses honed to a razor’s edge, the deathknight is attuned to the flow of violence.*
The Abyssal adds (Perception + Awareness) dice on a Join Battle roll. For each 10, she rerolls one failed die, starting with 1s and moving up.
For each failed die that’s rerolled into a success, the Abyssal banks one automatic success. For the rest of the scene, she can add these banked successes on any Awareness rolls she makes opposing an enemy’s Stealth.
