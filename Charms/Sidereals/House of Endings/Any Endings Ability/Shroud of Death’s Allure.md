*The Sidereal embodies death to those who see her, shrouding herself in mortal terror and morbid allure.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits against those who can perceive her.
- She counts as Hideous when it’s advantageous to her. If she already has the Merit, she doesn’t suffer its drawbacks.
- Ties of fascination, curiosity, or desire toward her also count as Ties of fear, and vice versa.
- Intimacies related to death also count as Ties to the Sidereal, with an emotional context appropriate to the view on death that Intimacy expresses.
For example, an Abyssal’s Principle of “death ends all sorrows” might count as a Tie of gratitude.
- Characters with any of the above Intimacies can’t attack the Sidereal, make threaten rolls against her, or take any other hostile action unless they pay one Willpower to resist for the scene. Mortals with Willpower lower than her Essence and trivial characters can’t resist.
Affected characters remain subject to the above effects for this Charm’s duration, even after they leave the Sidereal’s presence. This Psyche effect also applies to new Intimacies they form after leaving her presence. Resisting this for a scene costs two Willpower. Once a character’s done so three times, he’s freed from this effect. Affected characters can’t resist while the Sidereal is present or during events or activities related to death, like a funeral.
