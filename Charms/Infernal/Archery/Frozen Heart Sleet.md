*The Infernal's fury turns cold, raining down in opalescent sleet like a hail of pearls.*

When the Infernal makes a decisive attack, the sleet that spirals around her arrow inflicts an additional point of onslaught penalty. If she deals 3+ damage, her target's onslaught penalty subtracts from his movement actions and Resolve for the rest of the scene.

If the Infernal uses this Charm together with Storm-Temper Excitation or is already enraged by that Charm, she can freeze her wrath to killing cold, inflicting an additional point of onslaught penalty. If she deals 3+ damage, her target can't take a movement action this round - or the next round, if he's already taken one. This ends the inspired rage.
