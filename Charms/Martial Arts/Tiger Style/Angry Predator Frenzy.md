*The apex of Tiger style is nothing less than predation in its purest form.*
As the martial artist enters the [[Tiger Form]], she may pay an additional five motes and a point of [[Willpower]] to unleash the [[Angry Predator Frenzy]], roaring with bestial fury as she casts aside the restraints of humanity.
*Her muscles surge with newfound strength, while her eyes narrow to red slits of berserker rage.*
While in the [[Angry Predator Frenzy]], the martial artist may add up to ([[Strength]]) extra successes to the raw damage of decisive attacks, and gains a Defining Tie of savage hatred towards her enemies. In addition, she can rush as a reflexive action, in addition to her usual movement action for the turn. Conversely, while enraged, she cannot disengage or withdraw. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood add may add up to (lower of [[Strength]] or [[Essence]]) extra successes to the raw damage of decisive attacks. 
## Mastery
Whenever the martial artist resets to base [[Initiative]] after making a decisive attack while in this rage, she adds (her Strength/2, round up) to her base [[Initiative]]. In addition, while her anima is at the bonfire level, it takes on a bestial or destructive form that lashes out and rends the animas of her enemies. Whenever she damages an enemy with a decisive attack while at bonfire, his anima fades by one level, ripped apart by the claws or destructive vortices of her totemic display of fury.
