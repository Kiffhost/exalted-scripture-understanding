Era: Gossamer Dawn Epoch PROSTHETIC ARTIFACTS Amid the violence of the Age of Sorrows, even the Chosen suffer grave and terrible injuries. With- out miraculous chirurgy or sorcery, the best option available is often a wondrous prosthesis forged from the magical materials. Indeed, there were places and times in the First Age where such prostheses were the height of fashion. Artifact prostheses enable movement and sensation equivalent to flesh and blood. Some are held in place by straps and buckles, others by delicate enchanted pins, and some surgically grafted on. Punches and kicks with artifact prostheses are treated as normal unarmed attacks.

Most, however, are bespoke, fitting only the person they’re made for, as differences in body size and shape and the extent of each injury must be taken into consideration. Refitting a prosthesis to a new user is a superior repair project (Exalted, p. 241). Lunar shapeshifters most often use moonsilver prostheses, which naturally change shape to match whatever form they take. Other prostheses are incompatible with non-human forms and vanish into Elsewhere, unless they have a power or Evocation that lets them shift with their master, as Arete does. Black and green jade often possess this property. 
## Evocations of Carnelian Phoenix

The mount wearing Carnelian Phoenix suffers no deleterious effects from extreme climates, whether frozen tundra or broiling desert. Charms that protect the rider from environmental damage, such as Element-Resisting Prana, extend their effects to the mount.
