An assassin’s subtlest venoms are as obvious to the Lunar as a majordomo’s thick perfume. She doubles 8s on a scent-based roll to detect poisons, diseases, or similar contaminants, such as an Awareness roll to sniff out poison in a goblet of wine or a Medicine roll to diagnose an ailment. Alternatively, she doubles 8s on a scent-based roll to detect a concealed enemy or trap that might expose her to poison or disease. With Perception 5, Essence 3, the Lunar can detect tasteless and odorless substances, inferring their presence from the way they displace or dilute other scents. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Keen Nose, the Lunar doubles 7s instead.
