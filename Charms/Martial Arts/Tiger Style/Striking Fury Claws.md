Rigorous training, intense discipline, and the suffusing Essence of the tiger gives the martial artistâ€™s claw strikes the force to rend flesh and disembowel fallen enemies, making her a bare-handed killer. Striking Fury Claws converts up to (Strength) extra successes that would be added to the raw damage of a withering attack to postsoak dice of damage instead. Against an enemy who took a disengage or withdraw action on his last turn, these post-soak dice are instead converted to successes added to the damage roll. 

## Mastery

Extra successes converted by this Charm add both to the raw damage of the attack and to post-soak damage (or successes against fleeing enemies).
