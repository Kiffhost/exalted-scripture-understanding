*The Infernal’s teeth extend into spiked fangs and her mouth yawns into a gaping maw, dripping with pestilential blight.*

The Infernal gains a bite attack. It’s a heavy weapon (ACC +0, +11 DMG, − DEF, OVW 1) with the Lethal, Brawl, Grappling, Natural, and Piercing tags. It counts as an unarmed attack for all purposes. She adds one die of damage on decisive savaging attacks with it against grappled enemies.

For three motes, an enemy damaged by a decisive bite attack must instead roll against infected wounds, even if he has [[Exalted Healing]] (Exalted, p. 235). It gains +1 virulence and morbidity.
Rolls to disguise the Infernal’s fangs suffer a −2 penalty unless her mouth is covered completely.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has the [[Pestilent Apotheosis (Torment)|Pestilent Apotheosis]] feature, she can choose to substitute any disease she can use with this Charm for that feature’s standard disease when she enters her [[Devil-Body]].
## [[Keys]]
#### Pestilential Hunger Bite (Brawl 3)
The Infernal can transmit any mundane disease that she’s familiar with, and reduces its interval to one day if it’s higher. Mortals and crashed enemies gain the disease at Major intensity.
#### Carrion-Picking Appetite (Brawl 4) (2m)
The Infernal adds this Charm’s damage bonus on withering savage attacks, adding post-soak damage. She can pay two motes to increase the damage bonus to a number of dice equal to the rounds of control she has, maximum (higher of Essence or 3).
#### Plague-Maw Perfection (Essence 2, [[#Pestilential Hunger Bite (Brawl 3)|Pestilential Hunger Bite]])
The disease gains an additional +1 virulence and morbidity. Medicine rolls to treat it fail automatically unless enhanced by magic.
#### Devil-Fever Ravages (Brawl 5, Essence 2, [[#Pestilential Hunger Bite (Brawl 3)|Pestilential Hunger Bite]]) (+1wp)
Upon purchasing this key, the Infernal chooses a supernatural disease she’s familiar with. She can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to convey it through her bite. She can repurchase this key multiple times to add additional diseases to her repertoire.
#### All-Consuming Digestion (Brawl 5, Essence 3, [[#Carrion-Picking Appetite (Brawl 4) (2m)|Carrion-Picking Appetite]])
Each time the Infernal makes a savaging attack that benefits from this Charm, she adds two dice to the damage bonus of subsequent uses and +1 to their disease’s virulence for the rest of the grapple. This bonus stacks.
