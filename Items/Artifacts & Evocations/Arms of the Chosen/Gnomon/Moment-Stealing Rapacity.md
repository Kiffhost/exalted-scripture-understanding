Seven-Finger Wu passed his criminal streak to Gnomon. Its wielder slows time as she strikes a weapon from a foe’s hand, supplementing a disarm gambit (Exalted, p. 200) with a surprise attack’s −2 Defense penalty. If the wielder’s target is at short range, she may reflexively move one range band towards him in frozen time before attacking, flickering back to her original location in an instant once the gambit is completed. This doesn’t count as her movement action for the turn. Outside of combat, this Evocation can supplement any Larceny roll to pickpocket or steal, imposing a −3 penalty on opposing rolls and conferring the same movement benefit to the wielder. 

## Resonant

This Evocation waives a successful disarm gambit’s Initiative cost.
