With no other recourse, the Solar dominates another with the force of her presence. The Solar’s Caste Mark flashes and her eyes blaze as she casts her relentless spirit out into the world. It flows forth and strikes her target. Roll ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence) against the target’s Resolve. This non-specific effect cannot lower the target’s Resolve by exploiting an Intimacy, nor can the target invoke an Intimacy to raise his defense. If the roll is successful, the target goes catatonic for a moment, allowing the Solar to program him with instructions delivered via (threshold successes +1) short, clear sentences. These instructions may be complicated as the Solar is able to convey, but all must be carried out at the same time. If the Solar does not use a sentence to designate when the target should act, he will carry out this process immediately. Characters who complete given tasks or take actions on the back of this Charm do not remember why they did such things or even that they were ordered to do them. A character may spend three Willpower to reject the Solar’s programming, but this also results in his completely forgetting the Solar’s attempt. Characters who resist this Charm by any means cannot be confronted with it again for (target’s Integrity) days.
