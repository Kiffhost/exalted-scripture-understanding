*Death’s Lawgiver instills decay into the bones of an institution as she drains the life from it.*
The Abyssal rolls (Manipulation + Bureaucracy), doubling 9s, to reveal that she’s embedded a double agent in a rival organization. Her agent’s position is established by spending successes on Backing and Influence for him. Each dot cost one success. At the Storyteller’s discretion, the double agent can be an existing character rather than a new recruit.
