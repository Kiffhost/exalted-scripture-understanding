Exalted has a several general measurements to describe the division of time within the game, progressing from the largest to the smallest unit: 
# Chronicle
A complete game focusing on a continuous series of characters or events. Similar to the full run of a television series or cycle of books. 
# Story
A discrete portion of narrative that often takes several sessions to play out. Stories generally have an overall goal or framework, such as “Overthrow the satrap”.
# Session
A single evening of gaming, generally encompassing several [[#Scene]]s.
# Scene
A segment of action and roleplaying that takes place without a cut in time and location, like a scene in a film. A scene takes as few or as many rounds as are necessary to resolve events—in-setting, a scene might be as short as a few minutes or as long as a few hours. 
# Round
A unit of time used to measure and subdivide combat [[#Scene]]s, considered long enough to take one action. A round normally lasts about three seconds in combat situations, but could potentially represent more time. Characters take [[#turn]]s in order of [[Initiative]], highest to lowest. 
# Tick
The smallest real unit of time in the system. Ticks are numbered according to [[Initiative]] values. Does not necessarily connect to any length of time in-story. See also: Clash
# Turn
The [[#Tick]] on which a character declares their action for the combat [[#Round]] is called that character's turn. Each character only gets one turn per round, even if her initiative changes.
# Instant
A indivisible amount of time, used to describe events (such as charm activation) which begin and end independently of any other event. 
# Downtime
Time between [[#Scene]] or [[#Session]]s that pass without roleplaying, which is narrated in an abstract fashion—“Three weeks later, you finally arrive in Nexus,” or “My character spends the remaining days before the festival rigorously practicing martial arts on the mountaintop.”
