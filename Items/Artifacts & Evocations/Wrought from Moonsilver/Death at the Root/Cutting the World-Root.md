The world’s lifeblood withers and runs dry at Death at the Root’s fall. The wielder may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to extend the suppression inflicted by Sever the Flow to (Essence + Strength) days. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder successfully uses Sever the Flow against a greater demesne or manse, or uses Dragon’s Egg Cracked to destroy a greater hearthstone. 

## Resonant

If the wielder uses this Evocation at an especially vulnerable point within a demesne or manse, such as where its hearthstone grows, rolling 5+ extra successes suppresses the entirety of the site’s magic for the duration, and shatters any Linked hearthstones (Exalted, p. 604) originating from it.
