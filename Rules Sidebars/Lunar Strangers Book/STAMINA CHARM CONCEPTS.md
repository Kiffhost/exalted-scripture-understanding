Assumption of Unmarred Form (Essence 1;
Bear Sleep Technique): Reduce the time it takes to
recover from any crippling effect or other physical
ailment, including Shaping effects and curses that
affect the body.
Guardian Beast's Stand (Essence 2; Unyielding Silver Sentinel): The Lunar ignores onslaught
penalties, and withering attacks don’t award the
usual one Initiative for hitting her. This ends if she
takes a move action or is forcibly moved.
World-Killing Serpent Exhalation (Essence 2;
Behemoth’s Terrifying Inhalation, any Charm enhanced by this): Use Adder Fang Method to create
clouds of poisonous vapor, Rabid Beast Bite to create pestilential miasmas, or Acid-Spitting Attack to
create corrosive vapors.
Recumbent Elephant Hold (Essence 3; Moonsilver Thew Exertion): Pinning an enemy beneath
the Lunar’s magically amplified mass lets her take
hold actions by expending only one round of control and makes it harder for him to resist for the
grapple’s duration.
Enfleshed Arsenal Eruption (Essence 3; Weapon-Trapping Body Dominion): When attacked from
close range, the Lunar expels a weapon absorbed
with Weapon-Trapping Body Dominion to make a
powerful counterattack. Alternatively, she can reflexively make such attacks against grappled foes.
Breath-Drinking Executioner (Essence 5;
Storm-Swallowing Technique): Placing her mouth
near someone else’s, the Lunar draws the breath
from his lungs, making opposed (Stamina + Resistance) rolls to render him unconscious. This
requires a difficult gambit in combat, but is easier
against grappled foes.
