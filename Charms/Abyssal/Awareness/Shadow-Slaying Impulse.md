*The deathknight deprives her foes of the shadows’ safety, forcing them into the open.*
The Abyssal reflexively makes a decisive attack against a concealed enemy that she’s aware of. If she hits, her enemy is driven from his current hiding spot to a new one, and must roll ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) to maintain his concealment as usual. He can reflexively move one range band if necessary to do so, but this uses his movement action for the round. If there aren’t any other hiding spots he can reach, his concealment is broken automatically.
