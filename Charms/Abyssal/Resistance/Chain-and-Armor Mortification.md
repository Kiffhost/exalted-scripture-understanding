*Murderous chains coil around the Abyssal’s armor like a den of steel vipers, moving to her will alone.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm while bound with [[Iron Tomb Imprisonment]] to animate her armor’s chains, gaining the following benefits.
 - She may extend her chains out to short range to attack, retrieve objects, make feats of strength, or take similar physical actions that don’t involve fine manipulation. She uses her normal die pools for these actions. They’re medium weapons (+2 ACC, +9 DMG, +1 DEF, OVW 1) with the Bashing, [[Brawl]], [[Melee]], Disarming, Flexible, [[Grappling]], and Reaching tags. . They can’t make grapple gambits beyond close range.
 - She reduces the cost of grapple and disarm gambits with the chains by one [[Initiative]], or two [[Initiative]] with heavy armor.
 - Dragging an enemy grappled with the chains only costs one round of control.
 - The chains harry enemies that try to disengage from her, letting her oppose their rolls with ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) and inflicting her armor’s base mobility penalty on their disengage rolls.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm to enhance [[Wraith-Forged Plate]] (p. XX), the chains of darkness that emerge from her armor gain artifact traits (+3 ACC, +12 DMG, +1 DEF, OVW 4).
A [[Resistance]] 5 repurchase extends the chains’ range to medium.
