*Citing a spirit’s responsibilities to the world, the Sidereal weaves the chains of his duty into a worldly form.*
The Sidereal materializes a willing spirit within medium range for the rest of the scene for free. The cost depends on how closely the task the Sidereal materializes the spirit for relates to his role in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]: 
- One mote if it’s directly relevant to the spirit’s duties. 
- Three motes if it’s indirectly relevant. 
- Five motes if it’s not relevant at all or the spirit isn’t in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]. Spirit familiars and those bound with [[sorcery]] never cost more than three motes to materialize.
