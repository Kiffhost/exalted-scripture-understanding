*Even the slightest ripple of attention is perceptible to the savvy Dragon-Blood.*
When her suspicions are roused, she may invoke this Charm to roll ([[Perception]] + [[Larceny]]). As long as she rolls a single success, she can intuitively discern whether she’s being watched and by how many people. With [[Larceny]] 4, [[Essence]] 2, the Dragon-Blood may identify the precise location of an observer if she beats (the higher of his [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] or [[Guile]]).
