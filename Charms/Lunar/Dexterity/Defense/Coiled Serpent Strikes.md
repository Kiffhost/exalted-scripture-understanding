The Lunar answers her foe’s provocation with unthinking speed. If an attack misses her, she makes a decisive counterattack. She may reflexively ready a weapon for the counterattack. With an [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, when the Lunar is attacked multiple times on the same tick, counterattacking with this Charm doesn’t reset her [[Initiative]] until the tick ends.
