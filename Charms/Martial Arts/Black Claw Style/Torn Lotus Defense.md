*Every Black Claw student must submit to her sifu. As one whose heart is already conquered, she knows that any greater defeat is impossible. Drawing on this memory of love, the martial artist projects an unmistakable but fragile resolution.*
Whenever the martial artist successfully defends against an attack, she may use Torn Lotus Defense to make a counterattack with (Manipulation + Presence) to instill her attacker with a positive Tie towards herself, adding a number of dice equal to the attacker’s Essence (maximum five). The context of the Tie, be it respect, admiration, or even unexpected love, depends on the circumstances of the situation and may be chosen by the attacking character’s player. 
If the attacker already has a positive Tie towards the martial artist, this influence roll is also treated as a special withering counter attack that deals (Manipulation) points of unsoakable Initiative damage, as the martial artist plays on her enemy’s sympathies to throw him off balance and gain the upper hand. 
Using Torn Lotus Defense while Black Claw Form is active allows the Black Claw stylist to also apply the influence roll against all enemies and bystanders who witnessed the attack, without suffering the usual penalties for targeting multiple characters. Bystanders only face the social influence aspect of the counterattack, and never take withering damage from it. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood enjoys no extra benefits from using this Charm while Black Claw Form is active. 
## Mastery
The martial artist may declare this Charm prior to the attack roll, adding +1 to her Defense and then making the influence roll if she succeeds.
