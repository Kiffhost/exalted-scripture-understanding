*The stylist surges toward and around her foe with uncanny speed, striking from odd directions before he realizes where she’s gone.*
When the stylist rushes an enemy with lower Initiative or opposes his disengage roll, she adds dice equal to the difference between their Initiative, maximum (Athletics). If she has a relevant Intimacy of primal emotion, she adds (Intimacy) to her effective Initiative for this Charm’s bonus.
If the stylist’s roll also beats her enemy’s Defense, she creates an opening. The next time she attacks him before the end of the next round, if his Initiative is still lower than hers, she makes a surprise attack, inflicting −2 Defense.
