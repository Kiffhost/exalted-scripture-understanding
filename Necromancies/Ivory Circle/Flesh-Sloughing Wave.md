*The necromancer shapes a singing sphere of ivory [[Essence]] in hand and hurls it down to shatter at her feet, unleashing a wave of shrieking light to cleave flesh from bone.*
The necromancer unleashes a wave of [[Essence]], rolling an [[UNBLOCKABLE, UNDODGEABLE|unblockable]] ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) decisive attack against all living enemies within [[range]], ignoring [[cover]]. Each hit enemy suffers ([[Intelligence]] + extra successes) dice of damage, or ([[Intelligence]] + [[Essence]] + extra successes for [[Battle Group|battle groups]]. Damaged characters suffer an additional die of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]], at the start of each of their turns as their flesh seeks to escape them. This ends if a damage die doesn’t roll any successes. This spell also tears the flesh free from all corpses within range, leaving only clean bone behind.
## Control
The spell’s attack inflicts agonizing pain upon the living as it attempts to rip their flesh free.
Enemies injured by the spell increase their wound penalty by −1 for the rest of the scene. The necromancer may call forth a sphere of illuminating ivory light, making skin crawl and flesh twitch where light falls upon it.
