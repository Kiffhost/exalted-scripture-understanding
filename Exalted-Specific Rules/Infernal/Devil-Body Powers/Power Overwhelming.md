The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] overflows with unholy power. She chooses an (Attribute + Ability) dice pool and a range of actions comparable in scope to a specialty, like “Swords”, “Music” or “Mockery”.

Upon transforming, the Infernal rolls the chosen pool with (Essence) bonus dice and gains that many peripheral motes, which can put her above her normal maximum mote pool. At the end of each round in combat, she gains an additional mote if she succeeded on an action within the scope of the chosen “specialty.” She doesn’t gain this extra recovery while crashed.
