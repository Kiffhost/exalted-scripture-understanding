The Solar is a living font of vital knowledge. This Charm enhances rolls to introduce or challenge facts. She can now roll to establish a fact whenever her knowledge of historical events, cultural norms, local myths and rumors, number systems, etc. is challenged. If the topic in question falls into the Solar’s [[Lore]] expertise—that is, the background reflected by her [[Lore]] rating—or any of her [[Lore]] specialties, she gains one automatic success on the roll, and any extra successes she generates are doubled. However, the criteria under which Storytellers may veto introduced facts remain unchanged.
