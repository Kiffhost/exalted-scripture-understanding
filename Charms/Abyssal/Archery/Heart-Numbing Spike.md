*As the deathknight and her alien masters have flensed away their old identities, so must her foe.*
If the Abyssal deals 3+ decisive damage, her enemy loses one Willpower, plus an additional Willpower for each 10 on the damage roll, maximum (higher of Abyssal’s Essence or 3). For each point of Willpower he loses, one of his positive Intimacies is weakened by one step. Defining Intimacies can’t be affected unless the damage dealt exceeded the target’s base Resolve.
The Abyssal can target specific Intimacies she’s aware of; otherwise, the Storyteller chooses. The victim may resist this by paying an additional Willpower for each Intimacy he wishes to preserve.
If this attack incapacitates the Abyssal’s victim or reduces his Willpower to zero, he loses all memories associated with any Intimacies that are completely eroded. If someone or something reminds him of an Intimacy, he may pay three Willpower to regain his memories of it.
## Reset
Once per scene. Once the Abyssal uses this Charm against a character, he’s immune to further uses for (his Resolve) days.
