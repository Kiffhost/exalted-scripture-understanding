*Even at the cost of herself, the sister protects her charge.*

When the wearer would suffer decisive damage, she may have Second Sister take a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201) in her stead. Its soak and Hardness are reduced by one for each level of damage negated, but the mangling of metal reduces its mobility penalty is reduced by one until it’s repaired. This does not count towards the once-per-story limit on taking crippling injuries.

Repairing the “injury” and the penalties it inflicts requires a major repair project that takes one day per point of penalty. It can’t be repaired if there’s still any damage in Second Sister’s health track. This Evocation can’t be used again until the damage is repaired.
### Dissonant
Second Sister can only negate up to three levels of damage as a crippling injury.
### Resonant
The wearer can negate a hostile crippling effect or body-altering Shaping effect, inflicting analogous effects on the armor instead. This causes a soak and Hardness penalty of −5, or one that’s equal to any penalty inflicted by the negated effect if it’s lower. If the effect normally lasts for a scene or less, the armor recovers at the end of the scene; otherwise it requires repairs as normal.
