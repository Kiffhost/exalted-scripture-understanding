Sozen’s omens are no mere display; they are part of her, and she can become one with them. The Exalt dissolves into surrounding ominous manifestations, adding (Essence/2, round up) [[Defense|Evasion]] against an attack unless it is capable of hitting dematerialized characters. She then reforms at her current location. 

## Resonant

If the wearer successfully dodges the attack, she may reform at some other point within short range where the environment allows for appropriate phenomena. This doesn’t count as her movement action for the round.
