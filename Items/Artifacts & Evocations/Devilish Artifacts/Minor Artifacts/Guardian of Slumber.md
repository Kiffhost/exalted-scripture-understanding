This miniature shrine depicts a demon holding a crystalline heart that sheds light like a single lit candle. The sphere contains chalcanth, a living fluid made by slowly dissolving a live First Circle demon in vitriol, carefully mixed with reagents that keep the resulting substance on the cusp between sleeping and waking.

Attuning to the Guardian of Slumber costs three motes. When the attuned character sleeps within close range of it, she and any other characters within range of see the dissolved demon in their dreams and may experience its dream-memories as if they were their own. Its protective presence protects grants sleepers +2 Guile and Resolve. The Guardian can detect threats within medium range with a (Perception + Awareness) pool of eight dice, waking all sleepers if it detects a threat. It also wakes them if it’s moved out of close range.

If the attuned character acted in accordance with the dissolved demon’s nature in the past day, she can attune to this artifact for a night without needing to spend motes. An erymanthus Guardian of Slumber might grant this benefit after the sleeper engages in gruesome combat, while a teodozjia Guardian might grant this benefit after the sleeper tears down a monument to human hubris.
