*The Abyssal plucks a phantasmal arrow from the memories of war that echo through the Neverbornâ€™s nightmares, a bolt of smoke and hatred given form.*
The Abyssal can make an [[Archery]] attack without needing ammunition (including firedust). Once per scene, she can suffuse an arrow with undying hatred, adding two non-Charm dice on the attack roll.
A second purchase of this Charm lets the Abyssal use it to reflexively reload weapons with the Slow tag.
This makes such weapons compatible with magic that creates multiple attacks as long as she reloads for each attack.
[[Whispers]]: When the Abyssal uses this Charm to add dice on an attack roll, she can invoke her [[Whispers]] to convert them to non-Charm successes.
