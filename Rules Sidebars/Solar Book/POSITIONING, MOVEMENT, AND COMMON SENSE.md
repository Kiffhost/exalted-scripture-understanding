Movement in Exalted is heavily abstracted, and as such, requires a bit of common-sense adjudication. Changing position relative to one character may easily change an individual’s position relative to other characters as well—if you advance from short to close range toward two swordsmen fighting each other, then you’re now close to both of them, not just the one you advanced on. If you retreat away from those same figures, from short to medium range, then you’re now at medium range from both—and at long range from the bowman behind them, who is himself at short range from the swordsmen, but on the opposite side of the battlefield. 

Likewise, certain forms of unorthodox movement may obviate certain kinds of difficult terrain. A Lunar Exalt that transforms into a bird, for example, will be able to easily fly over most kinds of difficult terrain, while certain Charms make normally-difficult terrain easy to navigate. Ultimately, use common sense.
