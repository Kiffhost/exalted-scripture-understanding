*Embracing her purpose as a world-killing weapon, the deathknight finds certainty amid storms of doubt.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after her Resolve is beaten by influence that forces her into a Decision Point. She can cite an act of death’s chivalry she’s performed in the current story — or the previous one if it ended shortly ago — as if it were a Defining Intimacy in a Decision Point. Doing so waives the Willpower cost to resist.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by upholding a Defining Intimacy with an act of death’s chivalry.
