*Death’s Lawgiver reveals the folly of honeyed words and appeals to the heart, rebuking those who defy her doctrine.*
The Abyssal opposes another character’s influence roll with an counterargument or critique, making a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Socialize]]) instill roll with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes. If she succeeds, his influence fails against all targets.
The target can resist this influence by citing a Defining [[Intimacy]] to spend three [[Willpower]]. Doing so lets him make the influence roll normally, or resets the failed action if he resists after the roll. It also renders him immune to further uses of this Charm against the same influence.
