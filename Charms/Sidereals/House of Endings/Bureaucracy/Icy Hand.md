The Sidereal’s hand is wreathed with purifying cold, driving away bureaucratic corruption. Touching a character — a difficulty 1 unarmed gambit in combat — the Sidereal makes a special (Strength + Bureaucracy) instill roll against him. Success causes him to gain a Defining Principle of “I must perform my official duties diligently and refrain from all corruption.” He can’t voluntarily erode that Principle while this Charm remains active.
