*The grace of the crane inspires those who bear witness to it.* 
[[Humbling Enlightenment Commentary]] adds any stunt dice awarded to a decisive attack to its damage roll as well, as long as the stunt is based on verbally analyzing the enemy’s fighting style or the conflict as a whole in the style of an illustrative lesson or parable. 
If the damage of the attack exceeds the enemy’s [[Resolve]], the martial artist may count it as an automatically successful instill action to build a positive Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] to a group or a [[Intimacy|Principle]] representing a philosophical or ethical belief, based on the stunted commentary. If the enemy spends [[Willpower]] to resist or already possesses the [[Intimacy]] the martial artist is trying to create, he loses (the Crane stylist’s [[Charisma]]) [[Initiative]] (which the martial artist does not gain) as his attention is split between physical and philosophical conflict. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood can only use this Charm to enhance counterattacks granted by [[Crane Form]] or Crossed [[Wings]] Deflection. 
## Mastery
If the martial artist herself possesses the [[Intimacy]] she wishes to instill in her enemy with [[Humbling Enlightenment Commentary]], she adds its rating in bonus dice to the attack roll.
