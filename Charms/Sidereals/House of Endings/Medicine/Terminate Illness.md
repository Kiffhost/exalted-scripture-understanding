*The Sidereal makes the Lesser Sign of the Corpse over one suffering illness, striking his name from the rolls of that disease’s god.*
The Sidereal rolls to treat disease instantly and without needing tools. In addition to the roll’s usual effect, her patient can roll (Stamina + Resistance) against that disease’s morbidity immediately with −1 target number. A mundane disease is cured immediately if he succeeds.
Against supernatural diseases, success works as usual, reducing their intensity by one step.
