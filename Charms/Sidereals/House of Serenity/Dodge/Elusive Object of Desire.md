Wreathed in the fate of desires unfulfilled, the Sidereal is pursued by those who cannot touch her. If the Sidereal successfully dodges an attack, she counterattacks with an (Appearance + Dodge) instill roll to create a Tie of infatuation toward her. She isn’t perceived as the source of this influence. Against enemies with Defining Ties of infatuation toward the Sidereal, the counterattack succeeds automatically. If the Sidereal succeeds, her attacker must use his next turn to move toward her (if not already at close range) and attack her. If attacking the Sidereal isn’t possible, he can take another action but can’t attack anyone but her. This costs one Willpower to resist, separate from resisting the instill roll.
