*Consider: There are many kinds of nothingness.*
After a decisive attack roll against her, but before the damage roll, the stylist can use this Charm to roll ([[Initiative]] + current temporary [[Willpower]]), negating levels of damage equal to her successes. [[Uncountable damage]] is negated without needing a roll or resetting [[Initiative]]. If the attack deals no damage, the stylist shatters into black glass as reality recognizes a new possibility for her location. She reappears somewhere within [[Range|short range]] and may reflexively roll [[Stealth]] to establish concealment. This counts as defending against the attack. The reflective shards of glass are a one-time [[Environmental Hazards|environmental hazard]] with difficulty ([[Perception]]) and damage ([[Essence]], maximum 5) against all characters — friend or foe — within [[Range|close range]] of the stylist’s original apparent location.
## Enlightenment
This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived against enemies who are currently suffering Derangements, Psyche effects, or visibility-based penalties. 
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by successfully establishing concealment against all enemies and then making a surprise attack that crashes or deals 3+ decisive damage to a nontrivial enemy.
