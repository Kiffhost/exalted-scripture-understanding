The Dragon-Blood may cast down her enemies into a void as dark as the earth’s depths, stripping them of their senses. Like its prerequisite, this Charm requires her to touch her target and roll ([[Manipulation]] + [[Awareness]]) against his [[Resolve]], unmodified by Intimacies. In combat, touching an unwilling character is a difficulty 1 [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] gambit. On a success, she may seal away one of the following sets of senses as a crippling effect. Every two threshold successes on her ([[Manipulation]] + [[Awareness]]) roll allow her to seal an additional set of senses. Sight: An enemy stripped of sight suffers blindness (Exalted, p. 168). Hearing and Touch: In addition to deafness (Exalted, p. 168), the victim cannot make touch-based [[Perception]] rolls. He can still feel pain, although in a numbly debilitating way. Smell and Taste: The character cannot make [[Perception]]-based rolls to discern any level of detail with his senses of smell or taste. He also takes a −3 penalty on [[Awareness]] rolls to detect tainted food or drink, poisonous vapors, or similar harmful substances.
