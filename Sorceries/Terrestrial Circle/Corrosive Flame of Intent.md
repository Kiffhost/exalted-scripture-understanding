*The sorcerer calls forth an ember of indescribable colour — a spark from one of the outermost spheres of She Who Lives in Her Name.*

The sorcerer rolls (Intelligence + Occult) against the Resolve of a character who’s acted on one of his Principles this scene. Success ignites a flame that latches onto the Principle behind the action, forcing the victim to act on it further or burn alive.

The flame ignites if the victim goes a scene without meaningfully acting on the inflamed Principle or acts in a way that opposes it. He suffers three dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. This recurs each hour until five hours have passed. During this time, the victim suffers a −(Principle) penalty on all rolls that don’t align with that Intimacy. If he performs a life-altering task (Exalted, p. 216) that’s supported by the inflamed Principle, the duration is reduced by (Principle) hours.

A victim killed by this spell is instantly consumed by flame of unnameable colour, leaving no physical trace.
# Control
Those who gaze upon the sorcerer for too long see afterimages of her when they close their eyes for hours afterwards, drawn in impossible colours. If she targets a Defining Principle, the flame burns for an additional hour. The sorcerer may cast the spell and hold the flame in her cupped hand for up to a day until she locates a suitable target, requiring an unrolled Shape Sorcery action to unleash it.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
The flame’s duration is reduced by one hour.
