Empyrean Aegis flies from foe to foe, toppling them in a dynamic whirl of violence. The wielder makes a single decisive Thrown attack. If it hits, before rolling damage, she may have Empyrean Aegis rebound to strike another enemy within close range of the first, making another attack roll, and can continue to rebound it until she either misses, hits (Dexterity) enemies, or has no more targets in range. She divides her Initiative evenly among all hit characters to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring Hardness. Trivial opponents don’t count toward the maximum number of enemies that can be hit and suffer the wielder’s full Initiative in damage.
Attack-enhancing magic need only be used once to apply to all attacks made as part of this Evocation, apart from Excellencies, which must be paid separately for each attack roll.
## Dissonant
The wielder can’t continue rebounding once she’s hit (lower of Essence or Dexterity) enemies.
## Resonant
The wielder can rebound Empyrean Aegis to strike enemies within short range of a hit enemy.
