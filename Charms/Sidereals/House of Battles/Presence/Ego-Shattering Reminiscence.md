*The Sidereal exhales wisps of crimson stardust heavy with her memories, sharing her past with those caught in their light.*
Focusing on one of her memories, the Sidereal makes a special (Charisma + Presence) instill roll, ignoring multiple target penalties and the need for a shared language.
Affected characters have the memory implanted in their minds, remembering it as if they’d lived it themselves.
The chosen memory can’t be more than a scene long.
If the embedded memory is drastically inappropriate for a character’s life experiences, the resulting cognitive dissonance inflicts a −3 penalty on social and mental actions. This might affect a pacifist who remembers an outburst of berserk violence or a peasant given memories of growing up in Yu-Shan.
A character who uncovers evidence of a discrepancy in his memory may pay three Willpower to resist this Charm.
## Special activation rules
If the chosen memory relates to an Intimacy, the Sidereal can reflexively use Impose Nature, conveying its effect through this Charm’s roll.
