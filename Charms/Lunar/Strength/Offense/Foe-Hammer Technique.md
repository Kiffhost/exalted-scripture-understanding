*!!AsurgeofprimalstrengthreinforcestheLunar’sgripasshe!! !!liftsafoeoffhisfeetandbattershimagainstanotherenemy.!! She slams a grappled enemy into a second foe within close range, making one attack roll against both characters.*
If she hits the second character, he suffers half the damage rolled against the grappled foe, rounded up. His soak and [[Hardness]] still apply normally. A withering slam’s damage against the secondary target doesn’t grant [[Initiative]]. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing a grappled foe with a savaging attack. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with grapple-related abilities, the Lunar’s secondary target suffers the full damage rolled against the grappled enemy.
