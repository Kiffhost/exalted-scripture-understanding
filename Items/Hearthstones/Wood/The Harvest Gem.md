Any fields within five miles of this stone are exceptionally fertile. On good or average years all crops regularly produce yields more than twice as large as their normal best, and even in bad years, harvests are equal to the best yields that could normally be produced with the same tools and effort.
This stone does not reduce the need for labor or seed, but it guarantees this labor will always be well rewarded.
