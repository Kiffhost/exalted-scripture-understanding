*The Dragon-Blood’s familiar has wisdom beyond the ken of ordinary beasts, its mind honed by Air [[Essence]].*
The Exalt may use this Charm on her familiar’s turn, rolling ([[Charisma]] + [[Survival]]). She adds half the total successes rolled, rounded up, to one action her familiar takes that turn. In addition, if her familiar takes a defend other action to protect her, it may do so reflexively. If it attempts a distract gambit to benefit her, it doubles 7s on the attack roll.
