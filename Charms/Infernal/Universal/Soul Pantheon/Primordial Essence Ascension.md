*The Infernal has become a thing far beyond human, recasting herself in the Yozis’ image as she walks the path to transcending them.*

Before the Infernal can learn this Charm, she must manifest all seven of her fetich’s Second Circle demons with [[The Path of a Thousand Whispers]]. She externalizes her fetich soul within a Chrysalis Grotesque, where it takes form over this Charm’s training time. Once this is complete, it emerges as a Third Circle demon. The player and Storyteller should work together to determine the fetich’s traits, using the Third Circle demons in Chapter Seven as examples. It’s subject to the same rules and restrictions as Second Circle souls created with [[The Path of a Thousand Whispers]], except that it starts with an Essence rating of (Infernal’s Essence + 1). She doesn’t lose the benefits of [[Swallowing the Scorpion]], drawing on her entire soul pantheon through it.

Destroying the Infernal’s fetich with magic capable of permanently slaying spirits deals her a grievous spiritual wound, even as its successor-soul reforms. She loses all temporary Willpower and rolls (fetich’s Essence) dice, gaining Limit equal to her successes. She loses all Intimacies except for those embodied by her other Third Circle souls, and must choose that many new Intimacies. They can’t be similar to any of the Intimacies, although they don’t need to be a radical overhaul of her entire personality.
## [[Keys]]
#### Immortal Soul Multiplicity (Essence 4)
The Infernal forms a nascent Third Circle soul within herself, like an unwoven coadjutor budded off from her soul. Once she’s used [[The Path of a Thousand Whispers]] to form its seven Second Circle souls, she can manifest a Chrysalis Grotesque within which the new soul takes form. Each one embodies an aspect of the Infernal, like her fetich soul (p. XX). However, the Intimacies the Infernal gains from them are only Major. There’s no training time to learn this key — instead, the demon spends that time developing within the chrysalis. The spiritual backlash of their permanent destruction is less extreme than her fetich. She loses only the Intimacy embodied by the slain Third Circle soul, and any other Intimacies similar or directly related to it. She loses Willpower equal to her successes on the Limit roll, instead of losing all Willpower.
#### Cosmic Pantheon Unfurling (Essence 5)
The Infernal’s Third Circle souls gain +1 Essence, including demons she’s already created. This stacks with the bonus from [[The Path of a Thousand Whispers#Infernal Aeon Emanation (Essence 3)|Infernal Aeon Emanation]].
