Overwhelmed by foes, the Sidereal sees how they might yet complete the pattern of her victory. After suffering decisive damage, the Sidereal can use this Charm to make a withering counterattack, rolling ([Appearance or Stamina] + Performance) opposing her enemy’s attack roll. The counterattack is unsoakable and has (Essence + Willpower) raw damage. Each success on her damage roll negates one level of decisive damage; any excess success inflict withering damage as usual after her attacker’s Initiative resets. 
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by suffering enough decisive damage to increase the Sidereal’s wound penalty or using Beauty in Misfortune.
