*Even the greatest of behemoths are sent flying by the Infernal’s awful might.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must be grappling an enemy and have at least seven rounds of control. She makes a withering throw attack and doubles its total damage. Each round of control she has over seven increases the multiplier by one, up to a maximum of five with ten rounds of control.

If the Infernal uses [[Unrelenting Hellbound Might#Behemoth-Wrestling Fury (Brawl 5, Essence 3, God-Strangling Attitude (Brawl 5, Essence 2) (+3m) God-Strangling Attitude )|Behemoth-Wrestling Fury]] to grapple a Legendary Size enemy, she can inflict even greater damage. She only needs two rounds of control to use it. Instead of expending rounds of control to add damage, each round of control over two increases the damage multiplier by one, to a maximum of ten. If she uses [[Foe-Flung Doom]] together with this, she counts as having an additional round of control.
### Keys
#### Gore-Splattered Firmament Stain (Essence 4) (+3i)
Once per scene, the Infernal can pay a three-Initiative surcharge to gain this Charm’s increased benefits against an enemy without Legendary Size. She can reset this key by incapacitating a grappled enemy.
