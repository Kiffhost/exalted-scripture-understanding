*Debts to Death’s Lawgiver weigh heavy on the soul.*
When the Abyssal makes an instill, persuade, or threaten roll with [[Presence]] or [[Socialize]], she can leverage debts that a target owes to her or an organization she represents as if they were Intimacies. A debt’s effective intensity depends on what it would take to pay off, either with a [[Resources]] expenditure (Exalted, p. 578) or by performing a task (Exalted, p. 216).
Minor: An expenditure lower than the target’s [[Resources]] rating, or an inconvenient task.
Major: An expenditure up to one dot higher than the target’s [[Resources]] rating, or a serious task.
Defining: An expenditure at least two dots higher than the target’s [[Resources]] rating, or a life-changing task.
The debt need not be real or legitimate, but the character must believe he owes it.
