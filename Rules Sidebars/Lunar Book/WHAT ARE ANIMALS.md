Lunars are limited to taking human and animal forms — they can’t become magical beasts, spirits, or other strange creatures. Creation is home to many animals extinct or fictional on Earth, and the difference between them and magical beasts isn’t always obvious. If not specified, the Storyteller determines whether a creature is an animal. Intrinsic supernatural powers, like a fogshark’s ability to swim through mist, are disqualifying. Beyond that, the Storyteller’s decision should be guided by whether the creature could exist (or have existed) in the real world. If she thinks so, it’s probably an animal.
