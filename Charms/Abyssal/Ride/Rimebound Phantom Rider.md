*Death’s Lawgiver calls icy mist to encircle her steed, leaving the chill of the grave in her wak.*
The Abyssal adds an automatic success on a mounted rush, disengage, or withdraw, while the bitter chill she exudes forces enemies to reroll a successful die for each 1 they roll, starting with their 7s and moving up. This Charm can also be used in mounted races and other opposed rolls representing contests of speed.
The Abyssal can pay a one-mote, one-anima surcharge to leave a trail of freezing mist in her movement’s wake. This environmental hazard has difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round. In a contest of speed, an enemy whose roll is beaten by the Abyssal’s is exposed to this hazard. The mist takes one hour to dissipate, even in the strongest wind. Anything killed by the mist is frozen solid.
