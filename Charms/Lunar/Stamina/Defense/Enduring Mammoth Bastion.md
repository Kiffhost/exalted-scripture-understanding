When determining if her [[Hardness]] prevents damage from a decisive attack, herattackercomparesonlyhisInitiativetoherHardness, without considering damage dice added by other sources. If his attack’s damage roll doesn’t include his [[Initiative]] due to magic, he compares the lower of his damage dice or his actual [[Initiative]] to the Lunar’s [[Hardness]].
