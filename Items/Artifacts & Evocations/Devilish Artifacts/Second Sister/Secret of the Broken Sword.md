*Second Sister’s starmetal vambrace manifests fleeting shards of a forgotten daiklave to slash at an attacker.*

If a decisive attack from close range damages Second Sister or its wearer, she makes a decisive (Stamina + {Melee or Resistance}) counterattack. It has a base damage of one die for each level of damage dealt by the initial attack, ignoring Hardness, and adds the wearer’s attack roll extra successes as additional damage dice. This doesn’t use her Initiative or reset her to base.

If the wearer makes a counterattack in response to an attack that damaged both her and second sister, she adds (Essence) additional dice of damage.
### Resonant
The wearer always gains the additional damage bonus against attacks that dealt damage to her.
### Dissonant
This Evocation counts as the wielder’s attack for the round unless used in response to an attack that damaged Second Sister’s health track.
