Crushing her opponent to her chest, the stylist grabs him hard enough to crack ribs and crush windpipes.
A drag or withering savaging attack inflicts (Essence) dice of decisive damage. If this crashes or incapacitates a foe, it inflicts a −1 crippling penalty, as per Grizzly Maiming Strike. It stacks with that Charm’s penalty, but counts toward its maximum.

## Mastery
This attack always inflicts the crippling penalty.

## Terrestrial
The penalty stacks to a maximum of (stylist’s Essence).
