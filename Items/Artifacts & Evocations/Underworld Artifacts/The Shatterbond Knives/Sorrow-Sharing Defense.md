*Drawing on the bond that links her twin blades, the wielder uses them as a conduit for her pain.*
To use this Evocation, the wielder must be within medium range of an enemy afflicted with [[Gift of Pain]].
She can use it after being hit by a decisive attack, before the damage roll. If there are any 1s on the damage roll, the wielder transfers one level of damage from herself to that enemy. It canâ€™t be prevented.
Against her rival, each damage 1 roll transfers one level of damage, maximum (Rivalry).
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by successfully using [[Gift of Pain]] on a nontrivial rival.
