Woven using secret, long-lost First Age techniques, silken armor is woven of a material with the weight and texture of silk, but the resilience of tempered steel. Silken armor is usually beautifully tailored and decorated, wellsuited for formal occasions. It doesn’t count as armor for the purpose of martial arts styles which cannot be practiced in armor, and consequently is always at least Artifact ••••.
