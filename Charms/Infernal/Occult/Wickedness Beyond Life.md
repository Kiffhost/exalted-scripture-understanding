*The Infernal turns her gaze to the sunless lands of death, bringing the power of the Yozis to bear against the horrors birthed by their siblings’ murder.*

Infernal Charms that affect First Circle demons also apply to un-Exalted undead if this is advantageous for her. Mindless undead count as First Circle demons for such effects. This isn’t compatible with [[Demon-Thrall Goetia]].

While using [[Ultimate Darkness Internalization]] (p. XX), the Infernal treats un-Exalted undead with Essence 1-3 as First Circle demons.
