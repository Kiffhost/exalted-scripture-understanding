After spending at least an hour tending to her personal appearance or grooming, the Abyssal gains a bonus dot of [[Appearance]], which can raise her [[Appearance]] above 5. She adds a non-Charm die on [[read intentions]] rolls against characters whose base [[Resolve]] is lower than her [[Appearance]].
