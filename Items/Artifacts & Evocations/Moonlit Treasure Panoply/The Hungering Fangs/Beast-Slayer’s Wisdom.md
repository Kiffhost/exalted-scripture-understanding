*Experience has taught the Hungering Fangs’ master much, hard-won knowledge from slaying her monstrous foes.*
When the wielder uses [[Lessons of the Hunt]], she gains a [[Lore]] background related to the enemy she defeated.
The background is typically related to what kind of being it is (e.g., gods, Fair Folk, [[Solar Exalted]]), a group or culture it belongs to (e.g., Chiaroscuro, the Immaculate [[Order]], Luna’s spirit court), or any exceptional skills or powers it possesses (e.g., swordsmanship, demonic magic, Randanese thaumaturgy). She doubles 9s on [[Lore]] rolls using those backgrounds.
The knowledge gained with this Evocation doesn’t belong to the wielder — rather, it’s imbued in the Hungering Fangs. The wielder can’t use these [[Lore]] backgrounds without them.
