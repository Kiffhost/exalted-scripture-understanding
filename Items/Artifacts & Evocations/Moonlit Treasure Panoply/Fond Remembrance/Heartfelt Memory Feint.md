As memories change, feelings follow.
A successful false memory gambit also instills an Intimacy related to the change. For example, if the wielder replaces the target’s father in a fond childhood memory, she could instill a Tie to herself based on whatever emotions he feels for his father. This can strengthen or weaken existing Intimacy, subject to the usual requirements (Exalted, p. 215).
This influence can be resisted like other instill rolls (Exalted, p. 219), but enemies who do so in combat lose (wielder’s Essence) Initiative.
## Resonant
The wielder can use this Evocation reflexively after the gambit’s attack roll, but before the damage roll.
