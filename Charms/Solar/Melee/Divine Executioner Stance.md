When her sense of justice or righteousness is offended, the Solar’s wrath suffuses her blades, making her attacks swing faster and bite harder. When she first uses this Charm, she grips her weapon tightly and makes a vow based on a Principle or Tie that she holds, to use her every means to defend or protect that [[Intimacy]]. This act has great mystical significance, recorded in the celestial registers of Heaven, as the Lawgiver swears on her weapon and her skill to protect what is most dear. Thenceforth, whenever the Exalt makes a [[Melee]] attack in defense of the attached [[Intimacy]] and pays one mote, she gains bonus dice equal to (Intensity). In addition, if her target has acted to harm one of her Ties or threaten one of her Principles, a successful attack adds damage equal to the target’s strongest opposed [[Intimacy]] to the Solar or her protected Tie or Principle. In simple terms, the Lawgiver may not know her opponent’s Intimacies, but the Storyteller does, and can select the most appropriate [[Intimacy]] on the damage roll. If the Solar has vowed to protect the street urchins of Nighthammer, she may not realize that her target despises children, but the damage of her attack rips through his corrosive spirit and wounds him that much more deeply. This Charm confers no knowledge of Intimacies to the Solar. In addition, if the target is a cursed, blighted creature, such as a ghost or a demon, or one of the Abyssal Exalted, the damage on this attack is increased by one, gains one automatic success, and the damage is aggravated.

### On [[Divine Executioner Stance]]

The backer wanted a [[Melee]] Charm that would give him some added whomp from drawing on his Intimacies for an attack. A critical read on this Charm reveals that Solar [[Essence]] rips through and obliterates beings that are antithetical to the Solar’s spirit, ideals, and personal character. Intimacies are important to the formulation of a character’s identity, and a character’s identity is the foundation of their [[Essence]], their total being. Thus the Divine Executioner is poised to strike down those who stand against her and the things she represents. Backer: Patrick “Ash” Colford
