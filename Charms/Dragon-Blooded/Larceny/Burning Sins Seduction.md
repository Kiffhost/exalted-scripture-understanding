*The Dragon-Blood’s tongue stokes the flames of criminal passions, inciting poorly made decisions and reckless disregard for law.*
She makes a special inspire roll with ({Charisma or Manipulation}+Larceny) against a single character, expounding on the folly of the law or the thrill of the criminal lifestyle. On a successful roll, the target’s player chooses what emotion this influence inspires in him, as well as one of his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] related to that emotion that he’d be willing to break the law for. If he has no such [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he must form a Minor [[Intimacy]] that answers this question. The action that he takes as a result of this influence (Exalted, p. 217) must be a crime or equivalent transgression, and must uphold the inflamed [[Intimacy]]. Resisting this influence requires the target to enter a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], calling on an [[Intimacy]] of equal or greater strength than the inflamed [[Intimacy]].
