*The Infernal roars her fury, breaking the ranks of even the most disciplined troops as they flee the monster.*

The Infernal may use ({Appearance or Charisma} + War) to roll Join Battle and adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice. If she wins Join Battle, she enacts a Demoralized stratagem (Exalted, p. 212). If she’s already fighting under a Demoralized stratagem, she adds a free full Excellency on the Join Battle roll, and both stratagems’ penalties stack.
## [[Keys]]
#### Fear of Foretold Fury (War 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, the Infernal always adds a free full Excellency. She doesn’t need to win Join Battle to enact the stratagem, as long as she rolls 5+ successes. If she’s fighting under an enemy general’s stratagem, the stratagem’s threshold is added to this difficulty.
#### Panicked Soldier Stampede (Essence 4, [[#Fear of Foretold Fury (War 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)|Fear of Foretold Fury]])
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when an allied battle group rolls 3+ successes on an attack against a crashed enemy or an enemy battle group. The attack doesn’t deal any damage, but the Infernal enacts a Demoralized stratagem. This can stack with others, up to a maximum penalty of (higher of Essence or 3).
