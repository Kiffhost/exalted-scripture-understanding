Lurking beneath her victims, the Dragon-Blood unleashes death from the depths. She ignores penalties for firing into water or similar liquids, or for firing while submerged — she may even discharge a firewand while underwater. In Water Aura, if the Dragon-Blood uses this Charm to attack while underwater after aiming, she may reflexively roll (Wits + Stealth) against her target’s (Perception + Awareness) roll to establish concealment against him before she attacks, rendering her attack unexpected (Exalted, p. 203) on success. Once she does so, she cannot use this effect for the rest of the scene unless reset by landing an attack using any combat Ability against a nontrivial foe at close range.
