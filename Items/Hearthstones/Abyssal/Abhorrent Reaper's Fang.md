**Example Manse**: A hunting lodge tiled with mosaics of porcelain and ivory that detail a [[First Age]] hunting party which followed its hated prey beyond death so it could be slain twice. 
This deceptively sharp ivory trinket is carved with blasphemous elegies for those who will fall to its master. A weapon socketed with the stone automatically slays trivial characters struck with it. Once per round, if the socketed weaponâ€™s wielder uses it to incapacitate a nontrivial enemy with a decisive [[attack]], she adds +1 base [[Initiative]] upon resetting and gains one mote.
