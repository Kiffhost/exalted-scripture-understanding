The Sidereal smiles upon those seeking leisure and escape from strife, taking them into the house of Venus. The Sidereal blesses another character with good fortune in a specific social, political, or business goal: winning a certain farmhand’s heart, getting a job with a merchant prince’s caravan, securing a position in a queen’s court, etc. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one [[Willpower]] for others. Once per scene, he may gain −1 target number on an influence roll, read intentions roll, or a [[Bureaucracy]] roll related to this objective. Blessing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options. Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. Blissful Idiot Blessing (The Ewer): The Sidereal’s target confesses his feelings to someone. If they’re reciprocated, she can bless the objection of his attentions reflexively with a second use of this Charm. Infallible Matchmaker Advice (The Peacock): The Sidereal’s target heeds her advice in matters of romance, friendship, or politics. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively. Starlit Waltz Invitation (The Musician): The Sidereal’s target dances with her. Leashed Heart’s Reward (The Lovers): The Sidereal’s target makes a promise to her. Unexpected Guest Hospitality (The Pillar): The Sidereal’s target invites her into his home or shares a meal with her. The Sidereal can bless multiple characters with this Charm.
