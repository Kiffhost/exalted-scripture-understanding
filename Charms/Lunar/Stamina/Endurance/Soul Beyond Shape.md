The Lunar is more than the flesh she wears, an immortal [[Essence]] that can never truly be destroyed. She may prevent her death — by any cause — by sacrificing one of her human or animal shapes (but not her spirit shape or true human form). She heals any damage in her Incapacitated level, but remains unconscious, reflexively activating [[False Death Technique]] (p. XX) and [[Bear Sleep Technique]] (p. XX) for free as she enters a deep fugue. If she uses [[Wound-Mastering Body Evolution]] (p. XX), she waives its ongoing [[Initiative]] cost. While in this fugue, the Lunar can’t take damage except from decisive attacks, and doesn’t need food, water, or air. If an attack would kill her, she may sacrifice another shape to prevent it. Once the Lunar heals a single level of damage, this Charm ends. As she wakes, the corpses of the sacrificed forms emerge from her body, bearing the fatal wounds she avoided. This Charm can only be used once per story.
