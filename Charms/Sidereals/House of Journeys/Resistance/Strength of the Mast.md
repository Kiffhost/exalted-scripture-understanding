So long as she is the strongest one present, the Sidereal’s strength is equal to any task. The Sidereal adds +2 to her effective Strength to determine if she can attempt a feat of strength. If this would raise her effective Strength above that of all other characters present, the bonus increases to (higher of Essence or 3). If the Sidereal’s effective Strength exceeds the feat’s minimum, each excess dot adds one die.
