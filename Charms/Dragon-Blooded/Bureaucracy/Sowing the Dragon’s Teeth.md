*Battles may be won by force of arms, but wars are won with logistics.*
To use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must have first completed a challenging project relating to establishing supply lines, stocking supplies, or other logistical matters. When she or one of her allies makes a Strategic Maneuver roll that somehow benefits from that project, such as using supply lines to keep an army fed on a long march, she may use this Charm before the roll to grant it double 8s. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by completing a project or other bureaucratic task that fulfills a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).
