*The deathknight judges a soul’s worthiness to serve.*
The Abyssal makes a (Perception + Bureaucracy) read intentions roll against a member of an organization, adding (Essence) automatic successes. Success reveals the strongest Tie he holds toward it. She succeeds automatically against characters who don’t use magic to resist or who have less temporary Willpower than her.
With a Bureaucracy 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm to discern Ties toward organizations she belongs to rather than her target. She only succeeds automatically against characters whose permanent Willpower is lower than her own, even if they don’t use magic.
