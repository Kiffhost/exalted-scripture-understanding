*Tasting her prey on the air, the stylist is driven onward by slavering hunger.*
The stylist adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on a [[Join Battle]] roll or an [[Awareness]] roll opposing an enemy’s [[Stealth]] in combat.

This doesn’t use her movement action, but she can only do so once per round.
## Mastery
When the stylist advances toward an enemy, he loses one [[Initiative]].
