If the Solar comes across a person who holds a Principle that is in line with her character, personality or beliefs, and that person is considering or is about to take action which would violate that Principle, this Charm gives the Solar an anxious ping directing the Exalt’s gaze toward the character, and grants her three automatic non-Charm successes to a read intentions action to determine the Principle. Before the Solar uses this Charm, she is automatically aware of which person is in distress, although it confers no knowledge of this person or their situation. The Solar can only learn of the person’s troubles by talking to them to establish a read intentions action. This Charm is explicitly allowed to combine with the Charms of other Abilities.
