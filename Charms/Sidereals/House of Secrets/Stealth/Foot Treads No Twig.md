The world does not protest the Sidereal’s passage, a willing accomplice to fate’s covert servant. The Sidereal can use this Charm after a Stealth roll or a roll to conceal her tracks to reroll it, using the higher of the two results. The reroll receives the benefits of all magic used to enhance the first roll; the Sidereal can use additional Charms as well.
