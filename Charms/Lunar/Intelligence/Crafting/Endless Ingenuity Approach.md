*A creature of great and uncanny passions, the Lunar is driven to attain untold heights of innovation.*
When she upholds an [[Intimacy]] through knowledge, cunning, or similar intellectual prowess, she gains ([[Intimacy]]) gold points and rolls ([[Intelligence]] + {highest Craft}) with ([[Intimacy]]) bonus dice, gaining silver points equal to her successes. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by completing a non-basic project that fulfills at least one basic objective.
