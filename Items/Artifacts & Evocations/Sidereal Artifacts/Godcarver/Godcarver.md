In every legend of Ashjun Paja — the Zenith Caste priest-artisan who created some of the First Age’s greatest shrines, idols, and temples — the chisel Godcarver is at his side. It’s a flat sculptor’s chisel, a finger-thin starmetal rod gently widening to a thumbnail sized, flat-topped blade. The Old Realm character for “Harmony” is inlaid in orichalcum on both sides of the blade at its base. Ashjun dedicated his holy service not just to the Unconquered Sun, but to all Creation’s gods, and wielded Godcarver as a symbol of sacred authority. The ruins of his Western dominion are still dotted with hundreds of idols to ancient storm gods who once protected the land from drought and typhoon. The deep Wyld has yet to corrupt the embassy-temple he raised in Yo-Ping’s name, where Heaven’s ambassadors negotiated the Thousand Star Armistice. In Yu-Shan’s slums, some walls still bear his frescoes, commemorating the downtrodden and the destitute. Not all Godcarver’s masters have shared its creator’s compassionate purpose. In the Great Contagion’s aftermath, the Joybringer Anthuris created a shadow-heaven from the sanctuaries of her divine conspirators, using Godcarver to bind them to her hidden labyrinth-manse. Though her Circlemates ultimately thwarted her sedition, by the time they reached her shadow-heaven’s heart, she was long gone, never to be seen again. Godcarver was thought lost with her, but was rediscovered the next Calibration, laid atop the tomb of its first inheritor, Ashjun’s apprentice.
