The Lawgiver channels the blinding radiance of her anima banner through her weapon, binding blade and soul in a glorious physical manifestation of terrifying power. The Solar may only use this Charm when her anima is at the bonfire level. Her anima crawls over her weapon, suffusing it, and her iconic avatar can be seen to emanate from the blade. For the rest of the scene, her anima is focused around her blade, fluxing and rising with the use of Charms that expel her aura and returning with expenditures of Essence. While Immortal Blade Triumphant is active, her weapon cannot be disarmed or destroyed, and when she makes attacks, her damage is boosted greatly. Any stunt bonuses to her attacks are also added to her damage rolls, and if she is at the bonfire anima level, (Essence) damage dice are converted into automatic successes. Should the Solar need even greater power than this, she may force her anima out through her blade, releasing the Essence committed and terminating this Charm in a single devastating decisive attack. Doing so adds (Essence) automatic successes to the damage roll instead of converting (Essence)dicetoautomaticsuccesses,andallowstheattack to bypass hardness. This attack can only be made at the bonfire anima level. Calling upon this power ends this Charm and resets the Solarâ€™s anima banner to the dim level.
