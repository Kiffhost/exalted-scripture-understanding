*With a short memorial to herself, the necromancer exhales a fragment of her soul as a wandering shade, even as she collapses into catatonia.*
The necromancer’s shade is treated as a ghost with all her traits, but only ([[Essence]] + 1) −0 health levels.
She is naturally dematerialized and may render herself invisible by committing five motes. Her shade travels at ([[Essence]]) times her normal speed out of combat and can float up to short range above any surface, including razor-thin wires, water, etc. She can’t be harmed by mundane hazards and doesn’t need to breathe. She may pay four motes to materialize long enough to perform a single action.
The necromancer’s puissance is diminished when mustered for her shade, inflicting a two-mote surcharge on her [[Charms]]. She is also vulnerable to effects that target dematerialized spirits or the undead. She may end the spell reflexively on her own turn in combat. If her shade is slain, she awakens in her own body, suffering five dice of unpreventable decisive damage. Magic like [[Ghost-Eating Technique]] (Exalted, p.
354) instead fills her levels to Incapacitated and renders her unconscious for at least a day unless she receives magical healing.
## Control
The necromancer’s shade is forever half-awake, allowing her to perceive dematerialized spirits.
If she has magic that lets her do so, she gains one non-Charm success to detect such spirits while hidden, pierce their disguises, or track them.
## Distortion (13)
A rival sorcerer may contort the shade’s [[Essence]], forcing them to materialize and inflicting a −1 penalty to their physical actions.
