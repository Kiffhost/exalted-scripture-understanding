*The sorcerer makes the motions of gathering and snipping a thread, cutting free a victim’s shadow to serve as her spy.*

The sorcerer severs the shadow of a character within medium range. Against unwilling targets, this requires an unblockable (Intelligence + Occult) gambit at difficulty (target’s Essence) difficulty, unless he’s helpless. Success strips away his shadow, which squirms in the sorcerer’s grasp. He gains a Minor Obsession (Exalted, p. 169) with regaining his shadow until it’s restored.

During the day, the stolen shadow takes refuge alongside the sorcerer’s own. From sundown to sunrise, the sorcerer can command as the Spy That Walks in Darkness, an ideal infiltrator, thief, and assassin.

Ordinarily, this spell ends with the next dawn, returning the shadow to its owner. However, the sorcerer can trap the shadow indefinitely in a lightless room in which Erembour’s sigil has been painted in pitch. She can also cage it in a plum-sized orb of smoky quartz bound with gold wire, a Resources ••• purchase. She can send the Spy out each night, returning to its prison with the dawn. At Calibration, the imprisoned shadow escapes its bond and returns to its owner.

The sorcerer can sever her own shadow to use as a spy, but must have a prison prepared for it. Otherwise, it returns to her immediately.
# Control
The sorcerer can draw a stolen shadow into herself from sunset to sunrise instead of releasing it as a spy. This grants her the Spy’s Shadow Bond and Uncanny Doppelganger Merits.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
The opposing sorcerer can ask the shadow three questions about what it has witnessed and experienced since being severed from its owner.

## *Merits*
- **Caged Shade**: Any influence opposed by the Spy’s Tie toward the sorcerer is unacceptable. It can’t voluntarily weaken the Tie.
- **Darkest Self Duality**: In addition to the actions listed above, the sorcerer grants the Spy three of her target’s action pools. She can’t grant attack roll pools. She can also grant the target’s Appearance or Resolve in place of an action pool, but not other static values.
- **Darkness Itself**: The Spy blends into darkness, doubling 9s on Stealth rolls except in very brightly lit areas. It doubles 8s in darkness deep enough to inflict a visibility penalty and doubles 7s in complete darkness.
- **Inner Darkness Understanding**: The Spy doubles 7s on read intentions and profile character rolls against its owner. If it succeeds, the sorcerer becomes aware of whatever it learned.
- **Shadow Bond**: The Spy automatically succeeds on rolls to notice, find, or track its owner. It instinctively knows the direction to him.
- **Striking Shade**: The Spy’s attacks unless there’s bright light source within close range of it, like an anima banner or burning torch.
- **Umbral Form**: The Spy is immune to poison, disease, deprivation, and similar frailties of the flesh. It can move freely across two-dimensional surfaces and slip through anything that light could penetrate.
- **Uncanny Doppelganger**: The Spy adds (sorcerer’s Essence) automatic successes on rolls to disguise itself as its owner. It flawlessly resembles him in all respects, save that its don’t reflect light, and it cannot speak above a whisper. Like its owner, it casts no shadow. Characters can’t roll to see through the disguise without superhuman or magically enhanced senses.
