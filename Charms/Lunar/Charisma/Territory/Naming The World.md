Marking her land with sacred stones and signs, the Lunar spells out her dominion. She can use [[Shining Moon-Child Mark]] for ten motes and one [[Willpower]] to mark a territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]]. In addition to the mark’s normal effects, its emotional context counts as an additional quality of the territory, imposing bonuses and penalties as usual. Individual mortal natives of the territory can mark themselves in emulation of the signs left on the territory to gain Shining Moon-Child Mark’s benefits while in the territory, if the Lunar consents. She may revoke her consent at any time, stripping away the mark. Spirits within the territory are affected by the mark on the land and any marks adopted by mortal natives, regardless of their [[Resolve]], unless they’re actively working to oust the Lunar.
