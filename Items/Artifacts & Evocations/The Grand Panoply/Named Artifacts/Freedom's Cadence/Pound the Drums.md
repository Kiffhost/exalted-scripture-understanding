*Tapping into the spirit energies lingering in the starmetal she wears, the Exalt may harness a yet-smoldering shard of Gu-Shaiyen’s power and share it with those who fight at her side.*
As she invests her [[Essence]] in the armor, the faint sound of drums grows louder and louder, until it rings out vigorously across the battlefield. This effect creates an automatically successful inspire action that affects the wearer and her allies. Those affected feel their hearts pound in time with the exhilarating drumbeat, and each gains one [[Initiative]] at the end of the round as long as they’re within short range or closer of the Exalt and have not been struck with an attack that round. To maintain this effect round to round, the Exalt must flurry a miscellaneous action in which she dances along with the battle rhythm in each round. This effect ends if the Exalt is crashed, knocked down, or successfully grappled.
