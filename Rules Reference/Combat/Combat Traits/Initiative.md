Initiative is a very important element of combat. Initiative may be increased by [[Attack#withering|withering attacks]], and spent on Charms and [[Attack#decisive|decisive attacks]]. Starting initiative is determined each combat by a [[Join Battle]] roll.

There is no upper or lower limit on Initiative. A character of initiative of 0 or below is in a vulnerable state called [[#Initiative Crash]]. 
[[#Crashing]] an opponent provides an extra boost to a character's initiative, called [[#Break|Initiative Break]].
Finally, [[#Crashing]] an opponent who Crashed you provides a further bonus, called [[#Shift|Initiative Shift]].
# Crash
When a character has 0 or lower initiative, they are in [[#Crash]]. Crashed characters:
- Cannot launch [[Attack#decisive|decisive attacks]].
- Cannot use Charms with [[Charm Keywords#Perilous]].
- Are considered to have [[Hardness]] 0, regardless of equipment or magic, unless the source of [[Hardness]] explicitly states that it still applies in [[#Crash|Initiative Crash]].

If a character survives three consecutive turns in [[#Crash]], they reset to [[#Base]] initiative at the beginning of their next [[Time#turn|turn]].

[[Attack#withering|Withering attacks]] continue to affect a Crashed character as normal. However, if the Storyteller decides that a Crashed character has no hope of recovery and is being used as an easy source of initiative, they can declare he Crashed character defeated the next time they suffer a successful withering attack. 

If a character enters [[#Crash]] as a result of their own actions, they immediately lose another 5 initiative. 
## Crashing
The act of lowering an opponent's [[Initiative]] to 0 or less, called [[#Crash|Initiative Crash]].

Forcing an opponent into [[#Crash]] provides an [[#Break|Initiative Break]].
# Break
An [[#Break|Initiative Break]] bonus is a +5 bonus to Initiative, gained by [[#Crashing]] an enemy.

A character cannot gain an [[#Break|Initiative Break]] bonus from an enemy during the round that enemy recovers from [[#Crash]], or during the round that follows that.

If a character forces himself into [[#Crash]] (such as by using a Charm which costs Initiative to activate), then the [[#Break]] bonus is awarded to the opponent most directly responsible for provoking the action which caused the character to [[#Crash]], at the Storyteller’s discretion.
# Shift
Achieved by [[#Crashing]] an enemy who [[#Crash]]ed you.

- If you are currently below your [[#Base|Base Initiative]], [[#Shift]] returns you to [[#Base|Base Initiative]].
- Then, make a [[Join Battle]] roll, adding the result to your initiative.
- Your turn is then refreshed: any #Action/combat or #Action/movement you have used that turn are reset, allowing you to act again, immediately; however, should this renewed action be used to [[Attack]], you can only attack the character you Shifted against.

A character who entered [[#Crash]] as a result of his own actions (such as by using a [[Disengage]] action) cannot achieve Initiative [[#Shift]].
# Base
By default, the base initiative value is 3.
# Damage
The result of a [[Attack#withering|withering attack]], initiative damage is the amount by which the target's initiative is lowered at the end of the attack. It mostly represents bad positioning, tactical disadvantage, and discomfort—at most it might represent a character getting banged around or scratched.
