The Sidereal suffuses her horoscope with unspeakable dread, causing the pattern spiders to avert their gaze from her true birth sign in favor of a plausible alternative. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses three constellations. When she uses this Charm, she may exchange one of those constellations for her birth sign for this Charm’s duration, gaining its benefits for prophesy (p. XX). The Sidereal can add additional constellations to her repertoire for three experience points each.
