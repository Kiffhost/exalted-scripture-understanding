*The deathknight draws forth the chill of death’s misery from hearts conquered by despair.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal chooses two of the below enhancements to [[Frozen Fears Blossom]]. Some enhancements require her to pay a surcharge.
The Death of Joy (+2m): If the Abyssal deals damage, her target must weaken one of his positive Intimacies.
Icy Wake of Despair (+3m): If the Abyssal deals damage, the ground freezes out to short range around him, becoming difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) for the rest of the scene.
Razor Ice Blast (+2m, 2i): If the Abyssal deals damage, shards of ice erupt out to short range from her victim, a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 4, Damage (Abyssal’s [[Essence]])L. Her victim doesn’t receive a roll to resist the hazard.
Soul-Freezing Chill (+2m): The inflicted penalty also applies to the target’s [[Resolve]]. The Abyssal need only use this effect once to apply it to all stacked penalties from multiple uses.
The Abyssal may purchase additional enhancements for three experience points or one bonus point each.
Her player may work with the [[Storyteller]] to create new enhancements.
