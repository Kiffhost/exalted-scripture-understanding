**This Ability is necessary to create artifacts.**

[[Craft]] is used to create or repair objects through skilled labor, whether forging a sword, cutting the gem for a merchant prince’s brooch, or planning and overseeing the construction of a temple. The Exalted and other supernatural beings are capable of using this Ability to create [[artifact]]s, treasures of legendary quality that possess powerful magic of their own. 

### Special rules

When a character first buys this Ability, she must declare an *area of expertise* to which her crafting skill applies. Potential areas of expertise include *weapon forging*, *armoring*, *architecture*, *tailoring*, *woodwork*, *carpentry*, *cooking*, and anything else a player might come up with, covering similarly broad (but not all-encompassing) concepts. Additional areas of expertise must be purchased as independent Abilities—thus, a character might have [[Craft]] (Weapon Forging) 4, and [[Craft]] (Gemcutting) 2. Of note are [[Craft]] (Artifacts) and [[Craft]] (Geomancy); these two craft skills in specific are needed to craft artifacts and design and raise manses, respectively. 

For mundane crafts projects, Storytellers are encouraged to be generous in interpreting logical edge cases for uses of [[Craft]]. If a character needs to repair a horseshoe, but only has [[Craft]] (Armoring), it’s reasonable to declare that the character’s [[Craft]] rating encompasses basic metal fabrication and to allow her to use her [[Craft]] rating anyway, perhaps at +1 difficulty
## Large-Scale Projects

Large-scale undertakings such as merchant ships or palaces are undertaken as [[Superior Project|superior projects]]. Unlike artifacts, they only require a proper [[Craft]] Ability (such as architecture) and sufficient materials (including, for most such projects, significant funds and manpower) to attempt. Starting a large-scale project requires a superior craft slot costing two major slots and two gold points, and attempting to finish it follows the same rules as trying to complete an [[Artifact]] 2 superior project, save that the Storyteller dictates an appropriate amount of time spent working on the project before an attempt to finish can be attempted, and the project has no terminus. 
## [[Manse]]s

[[Manse]] construction follows the same rules as artifact construction with the following exceptions: [[Craft]] (Geomancy) replaces [[Craft]] (Artifacts) for all requirements (Geomancy works much like Artifacts, save that Architecture is the only relevant [[Craft]] that Geomancy can derive from), a threedot manse requires at least a year of construction while a five-dot manse requires at least two years, and a three-dot manse has a goal number of 50 while a five-dot manse has a goal number of 100. Under incredibly rare circumstances, a Solar might attempt to raise an N/A-rated manse atop an N/A-rated demesne, harnessing the raw energies of Creation to fuel unique feats of architectural power. This follows all of the same rules as completing a legendary project, save that it requires [[Craft]] (Geomancy) rather than [[Craft]] (Artifacts).
