*The Sidereal mirrors her enemy’s hostility, wreathing her fists in baleful radiance.*
The Sidereal’s attack adds (lower of her Strength or enemy’s Essence) dice of post-soak withering damage or decisive damage. She can deal lethal damage unarmed.
Against enemies of fate, she isn’t limited by her Strength if her enemy’s Essence is higher, and her decisive attacks deal aggravated damage.
