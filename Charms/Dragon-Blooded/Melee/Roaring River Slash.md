The outer edge of the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s attack is followed by a ribbon of water moving at incredible speed. She makes a decisive attack and rolls its damage twice, combining both results to determine the total damage. If used together with offensive magic that sets foes on fire, the water extinguishes the flames. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by going a full round without either making attacks or being attacked. It cannot be reset while the Dragon-Blood is crashed.
