The Infernal can attack several enemies at once, either because she possesses a vast body, many swarming limbs, or can unleash devastating supernatural forces like a bone-breaking harmony sung by many mouths. She chooses one of her natural attacks or an attack from the [[Enhanced Attack]] feature. She can use it to make attacks against all enemies within close range of a point within its range:
- On withering attacks, only the highest damage roll awards Initiative.
- On decisive attacks, she divides her Initiative evenly among all hit enemies, rounding up, to determine the damage rolled against them.
- On gambits, she divides her Initiative evenly among hit enemies, rounding up, for Initiative rolls. She only needs to pay the gambit’s Initiative cost once.

Area attacks are incompatible with Simple Charms.

An alternative version of this power lets the Infernal roll her full Initiative against each enemy hit by a decisive attack or gambit or gain the Initiative from all enemies hit by a withering attack. However, she can only do so once per scene. She can purchase both versions separately.
