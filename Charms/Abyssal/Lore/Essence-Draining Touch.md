*Understanding the cycles of [[Essence]] that flow through both the living and the dead, the Abyssal siphons away another’s power.*
The Abyssal steals up to ([[Essence]] x3) motes from a willing or helpless character with a touch. Once per scene, she may roll ([[Wits]] + [[Lore]]) when she uses this Charm, stealing an additional mote for each success.
With a [[Lore]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can instead transfer up to ([[Essence]] x3) of her motes to a character.
If she rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Lore]]), she doesn’t lose the additional motes generated by it.
A third purchase at [[Lore]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 lets the Abyssal use this Charm reflexively on her turn, and lets her waive its cost the first time she uses it in a scene. When she rolls for extra motes, she rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10.
