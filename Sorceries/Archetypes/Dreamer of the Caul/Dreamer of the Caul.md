The histories of the Caulborn clans who preserve this sorcerous tradition tell of how they discovered a secret as old as the continent-isle itself, left there by some divine hand. Each clan knows it by a different name â€” the Twice-Dreamt Road, the Midnight Pact, the Rite of Abraxus. 

Sorcerers who walk this path commune with the Caul, opening themselves to its dreamlike existence through sleep deprivation, ecstatic rituals, and entheogens. Some in the Silver Pact have studied it under the Caulborn sorcerer Mekne-Mesi, whose pact with Skathra Venomchild allows any Lunar to receive his tutelage in exchange for three favors.
