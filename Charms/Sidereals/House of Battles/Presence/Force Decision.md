*Sensing a moment of indecision, the Sidereal injects her own opinion into the matter.*
When the Sidereal witnesses a character faced with a choice that has multiple options, she may reflexively make a special (Charisma + Presence) persuade roll.
If successful, her target is forced into a Decision Point.
The Sidereal makes a choice for the target and cites one of her own Intimacies that supports it. He must either make that choice himself or resist this influence by citing an opposing Intimacy whose intensity equals or exceeds the Sidereal’s and paying one Willpower.
The Sidereal can’t choose an option her target isn’t aware of, though she’s free to suggest options to him before using this Charm. She’s never perceived as this effect’s source.
If the Sidereal knows Wise Choice (p. 296), she can use it reflexively to evaluate her target’s options before she chooses one.
