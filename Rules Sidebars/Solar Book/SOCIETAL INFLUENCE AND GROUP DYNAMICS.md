Many Socialize Charms describe functioning to change policy, or having an effect on a character’s standing in a particular culture. These Charms apply equally to small groups such as “The local fishermen,” “Members of the Guild hall,” “The Nimble Raiton Company,” and so on. Keep in mind that small groups have their own distinct cultures and rituals and that these terms do not refer exclusively to the politics and mores of nations. Charms such as Understanding the Court work equally well in a tea shop where peasants congregate as they do in the palace of Chiaroscuro’s Tri-Khan. Special rules: Upon purchase, the player creates a persona with a number of Intimacies. The player can invest it with as many or as few Ties as needed, but must create a number of new Principles equal to the number of Principles held by the Solar. When creating these Intimacies, the player should think of the persona as a different character with its own thoughts, feelings, and ideas. It is recommended that the player give the persona its own character concept to be reflected in the persona’s Intimacies. The player should aim for a concept and Intimacies which will serve the Solar in her desired social milieu.
