*Spotting the perfect moment for theft, the Sidereal strips away materialistic delusions of self-importance.*
The Sidereal can steal in plain sight with pickpocketing rolls and similar Larceny rolls, inflicting a −1 penalty on opposed rolls. Characters who fail their opposed rolls can’t notice the theft until (Sidereal’s Essence) minutes have passed or circumstances draw attention to it.
If a successful roll also beats the Resolve of the character the Sidereal stole from, it counts as an instill roll to weaken any Intimacy he has related to the object — an artisan’s Principle of pride in his handiwork, a merrymaker’s Tie of fondness for strong drink, a warrior’s Tie of respect for his blade, etc.
