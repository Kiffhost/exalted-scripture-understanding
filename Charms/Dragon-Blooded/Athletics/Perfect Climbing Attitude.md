*The Dragon-Blood scales sheer rock faces and perilous mountains with effortless grace, her fingers carving handholds from unyielding stone.*
She may use her reflexive move action to climb a single range band up or down a stone or earthen surface without needing to make an [[Athletics]] roll, and can even ascend sheer surfaces. Any handholds carved with this Charm close as soon as the Dragon-Blood has moved on from them, denying the advantage to her pursuers. With [[Athletics]] 3, [[Essence]] 2, she may choose to leave them in place, acting as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for any others who wish to climb up that path.
