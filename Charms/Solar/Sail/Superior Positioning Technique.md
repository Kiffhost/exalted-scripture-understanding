*The Solar guides her ship along a flow of [[Essence]] in opposition to an enemy vessel.*
This Charm supplements a [[positioning]] maneuver (p. 245), treating the opponent’s 1s as 10s on the Solar’s roll. In addition, this Charm automatically evades a ram maneuver, even if the opponent’s roll succeeds. To avoid transparency, the player should not declare this Charm aloud, but should write it on a piece of paper for the Storyteller to keep face down until the dice have been rolled.
