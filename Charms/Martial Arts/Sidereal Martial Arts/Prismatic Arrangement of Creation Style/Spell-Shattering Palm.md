*Delicate threads of spellcraft unravel as the stylist yanks and pulls at them.*
When a character the stylist can perceive casts a spell that targets her, she clashes the final [[Shape Sorcery]] roll with a decisive ({Intelligence or Wits} + [[Martial Arts]]) attack. Against ritual spells or other unrolled spells, the caster rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) for the clash. Winning the clash negates the spell’s effect, including its effects on other characters. The stylist doesn’t make a damage roll or reset her [[Initiative]]. Against spells of a Circle the stylist can’t cast, she must pay a surcharge of one [[Willpower]] per circle she falls short — e.g., a Terrestrial Circle sorcerer would need to pay a two-[[Willpower]] surcharge to clash Solar Circle [[sorcery]]. Sorcerous initiation doesn’t aid in clashing necromantic spells or vice versa.
## Enlightenment
The stylist can channel and redirect a clashed spell’s [[Essence]] back at the caster, dealing (spell’s Circle x2) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t reset her [[Initiative]].
