*A paper fan, a colorful sash, a pair of chopsticks, a ball gown’s train—all of these can be killing weapons in the hands of a student of this style.*
Elegant Weapon Repertoire adds the accuracy bonus of a weapon to the raw damage of a withering attack made with it, or one die to the raw damage of a decisive attack. 
Alternatively, this Charm can supplement a ready weapon action to suffuse an accessory, garment, or some similar ornamental object with Essence, allowing the martial artist to wield it as a weapon. For the rest of the scene, it is treated as a mundane light weapon, with tags based on the exact nature of the item, as described below. While several examples are provided for each category, the Storyteller is encouraged to reward creative ideas that fit within the aesthetics of this style. 
#### Disarming
The disarming tag applies to garments or accessories that can be used to leverage weapons out of their wielder’s grip—primarily sashes or sleeves that have had lead weights sewn into them for this specific purpose (which overrides the usual tag they would receive). These weapons usually also have the bashing and flexible tags. 
#### Grappling
The grappling tag applies to accessories and garments that could conceivably be used to entangle or tie up an enemy, such as the sash of a kimono, a long scarf, a ball gown train, a blanket or sheet, or a length of silken rope. These weapons usually also have the bashing and flexible tags. 
#### Piercing
The piercing tag applies to accessories that are small or sharp enough to conceivably slip through the defenses of armor, such as hairpins, cutlery, a broken teacup, knitting needles, or elegantly decorated false nails. These weapons usually also have the lethal tag. 
#### Shield
The shield tag applies to accessories and garments that seem well-suited to fending off attacks with their broad surface, such as paper fans, hand mirrors, or the long sleeves of a robe. These weapons usually also have the bashing tag.
