## Bound Demons
Some Infernal Charms refer to “bound demons.” These include demons that the Infernal has summoned and bound using sorcery or similar magic, demons that she’s claimed as familiars with magic like [[Demon-Thrall Goetia]] (p. XX), and her own demonic souls created with Charms like [[The Path of a Thousand Whispers]] (p. XX).
## [[Experience Debt]]
Certain Charms let player characters purchase traits by incurring experience debt equal to their experience point cost. Any experience they subsequently receive goes toward paying off the debt until it’s paid in full. An Exalt’s player can choose to pay off a debt solely with Infernal Experience or the like, as long as it can be spent to buy that trait. A character can’t incur additional experience debt until her existing debt is fully paid. Storyteller characters can’t incur experience debt; instead, they can benefit from such Charms only once per story.
## Negative Intimacies
Both Ties and Principles can be negative. Like negative Ties, negative Principles express or are based on a negative emotion or the like. Examples include “Pay violence unto violence” or “Trust no one.”
