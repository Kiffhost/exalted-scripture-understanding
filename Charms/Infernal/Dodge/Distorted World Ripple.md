*The Infernal is not where she seems to be, as if all the world but her was a mirror cracked.*

When the Infernal dodges, up to (higher of Essence or 3) 6s on the attack roll force the attacker to reroll that many successful dice, starting with 7s and moving up. If her attacker rolls at least three 6s, she gains an additional +1 Evasion.
## Keys
#### Topiary Reality Mirage (Dodge 3)
The Infernal can use this Charm after an attack roll against her.
#### Skewed Reflection Shift (Dodge 5, Essence 2) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, each 6 rerolls three successful dice.
