*A cloud of dark feathers bursts from the Abyssal, concealing her within the swirling storm.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after dodging an attack, unleashing a whirlwind of black feathers that extends out to short range until her next turn. Enemies caught within it suffer a −2 penalty on visiondependent rolls, which increases to −3 on attacks against the Abyssal.
With a [[Dodge]] 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to extend the whirling feathers out to medium range. The buffeting feathers inflict its penalty on all physical actions.
Enemies lose one [[Initiative]] each time they move into or within the feathers, and at the end of each round.
