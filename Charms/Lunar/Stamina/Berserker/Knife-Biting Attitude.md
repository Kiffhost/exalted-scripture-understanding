*Pain stirs the Lunarâ€™s rage, empowering her to deal out retribution.*
This Charm must be used after being hit by a decisive attack, before damage is rolled. The Lunar gains one [[Initiative]] per level of damage dealt to her. While [[Relentless Lunar Fury]] is active, this Charm loses the Perilous keyword.
