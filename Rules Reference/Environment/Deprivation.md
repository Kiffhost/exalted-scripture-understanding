Exalts and mortals both share the basic necessities of life—air, water, and food. A character will suffocate or drown after (Stamina) minutes without air, die of dehydration after (Stamina) days without water, and perish from starvation after (Stamina) weeks without food. 

Characters suffer a -3 penalty to all actions after (Stamina) days without food, as well as in their final hours without water. 

Characters undergoing heavy exertion (such as combat) or who didn’t manage to get a deep breath before having their air cut off can drown much faster than those who are holding their breath while undergoing normal exertion (such as diving). A character who is being forcibly drowned, or who is engaging in combat underwater, will perish after (Stamina x 2) turns without air.
