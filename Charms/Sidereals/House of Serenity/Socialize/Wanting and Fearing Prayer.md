As the Sidereal names aloud two people whose lives she wishes to entangle, she holds up two prayer strips bearing the Scripture of the Desperate Maiden, which burn lambent blue in her hands. The Sidereal rolls (Manipulation + Socialize) against the Resolve of two characters and proposes a relationship between the two of them. There is no limit on range, but she must have interacted with each of those characters within the previous day or the current session. If she beats a character’s Resolve, one of the prayer strips reforms within him, wrapped around his bones. He gains a Defining Tie toward the other character with an emotional context appropriate to the proposed relationship. This Intimacy can be weakened normally, but the victim can’t act against it — even if it’s been fully eroded — unless he enters a Decision Point and spends one Willpower to resist for a scene. If the Sidereal beats both character’s Resolve, fate works to bring them together in the proposed relationship. The more plausible that relationship, the more quickly this occurs and the more likely it is to succeed: it’s easier to declare two neighbors will fall in love than two strangers from opposite ends of Creation. Once per scene, the Sidereal’s player may impose −1 or +1 target number on a roll to help bring about the relationship. While the prayer strips’ light can’t shine through even the thinnest layer of skin, it bursts forth brilliantly if that flesh is ever cut away, including if a character reaches a −4 wound penalty. This penalizes Stealth as a glowing anima banner (p. XX). Removing a prayer strip is an extended (Intelligence + Medicine) action with difficulty 4, goal number 20, and an interval of one hour. At each interval, the patient suffers one die of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. Successfully removing the prayer strip frees that character from this Charm’s effects, including that bringing the pair together. If the Sidereal ends this Charm, both prayer strips crumble to ash. Reset: Once per story.
