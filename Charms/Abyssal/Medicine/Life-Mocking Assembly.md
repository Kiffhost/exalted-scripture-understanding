*The Abyssal is an artist of dead flesh, transforming bone and viscera into undead masterpieces.*
The Abyssal spends a few minutes laboring over a human or human-like corpse with surgical tools, reanimating it as a zombie (Exalted, p. 502). It has a Defining Tie of obedience towards her that can’t be weakened. With Survival 3, she can reanimate animals (p. XX) unless they have Legendary Size.
If the deathknight has dots in a Craft that involves the preparation or use of dead flesh, such as embalming, taxidermy, tanning, or cooking, she receives craft points for meeting objectives like with a basic project (Exalted, p. 240).
With Medicine 4, Essence 2, the Abyssal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge and spend an hour in surgery to create a superior zombie called a corpse-soldier.
Alternatively, she can upgrade a zombie she’s created with an hour-long surgery. Battle groups of corpse-soldiers have average Drill and Might 2. Reanimated animals can’t be made corpse soldiers.
