Duration: Session
---
The Infernal demonstrates her supernatural power over the world, employing her most obvious and impressive powers. She will pursue her ambitions unrelentingly, with a complete lack of subtlety and utilizing mystical power if at all possible: doors blown open by bolts of Essence, crowds dispersed by dread magics, messages delivered by carving the earth with summoned demons, etc. She will use forceful and overtly magical means even when they will obviously draw trouble, or where subtler approaches might be more effective.

**Duration**: Session.
Sky-Challenging Thunder can be ended prematurely if the Infernal’s use of her powers frightens a character she has a Major or Defining positive Tie towards.
