*The Abyssal reshapes ruined flesh, replacing maimed organs and severed limbs with deathless perfection.*
The Abyssal treats a crippling effect or a similar physical malady with an extended ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) roll. It has a one-month interval, difficulty 5, and a goal number of 20. If successful, the effect’s severity is lowered by one step, as if it were a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201). Once a crippling injury has been reduced to the lowest level, success heals it fully. This healing can’t regenerate damaged or missing tissue, but it can replace it by grafting on undead flesh.
This Charm can also be used to treat Derangements. This works as above, except that Derangements can’t be fully healed, only reduced to Minor intensity.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, some minor injuries may be treated with a single roll, taking only an hour to treat.
