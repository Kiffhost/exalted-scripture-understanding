Tugging at someone’s name, the Sidereal pulls it free of his fate and appends it to her own. The Sidereal rolls (Wits + Larceny) against the Resolve of a character within short range to steal his name — or one of the names he goes by, if there’s more than one. Sobriquets, like “the Roseblack” or an Abyssal’s title, can also be stolen. If the Sidereal succeeds, she takes the name and can truthfully use it to identify herself. Her victim can’t use the stolen name to identify himself, whether directly or indirectly. Other character with Resolve lower than the roll’s success can’t remember that it’s the victim’s name. The Sidereal’s victim can steal his name back by identifying her as the thief and winning a noteworthy victory over her — defeating her in combat, decisively outmaneuvering her in social intrigues, etc. He must make a brief monologue in which he reclaims the name. Other characters can pay one Willpower to regain memories suppressed by this Charm if they have a Major or Defining Ties toward the victim or have evidence that the name is his. It can also be resisted with magic that specifically protects against memory-altering Psyche effects. The Sidereal may have up to (Essence) stolen names at a time, reducing the mote cost of subsequent uses to one mote, one Willpower.
