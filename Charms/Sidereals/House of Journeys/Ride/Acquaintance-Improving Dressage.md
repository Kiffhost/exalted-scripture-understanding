*Putting faithful servants through their paces, the Sidereal draws forth hidden depths.*
The Sidereal trains an animal — including one apotheosized with Spirit-Shape Companion — in a latent special ability or Merit (Exalted, p. 554), rolling ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Ride). She doesn’t need to meet the usual specialty requirements and shortens the training interval to one week.
If the Sidereal knows Breaking the Wild Mortal, she can also train characters affected by it and other characters who are immune to her arcane fate. This lets them go into experience debt to gain specialties of “Serving the Sidereal” in up to (Sidereal’s Essence +1) Abilities or (her Essence/2, rounded up) dots of Willpower.
Training time is reduced to one week.
With Ride 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a two-experience surcharge to grant an animal familiar a magical ability or spirit familiars a spirit Charm. Alternatively, she can let someone immune to her arcane fate incur experience debt to learn a Sidereal Charm, Martial Arts Charm, Eclipse Charm, spell, or thaumaturgical ritual she knows that they would qualify to learn normally. The surcharge is waived the first time she uses this Charm, and when she uses it on player characters. Experience spent this way is regained if the beneficiary dies.
