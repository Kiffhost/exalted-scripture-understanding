*Whether in a dark cavern, seedy teahouse, or ivy-covered ruin, the Lunar shelters masses of followers in her secret holdfast.*
When using [[Secure Den Technique]] in a territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]], she can commit five additional motes to prepare a den that can hold ({Essence + Wits} x10) people. This increases the time necessary to prepare the den to one week, or increases the penalty on the roll for [[Magpie’s Nest Resourcefulness]] to −5. If the Lunar has an applicable [[Craft]], she gains craft points as though she’d completed a major project.
