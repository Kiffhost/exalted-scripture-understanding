*The necromancer unleashes a cascade of purple lightning from her palm, striking nearby corpses. With an unearthly spasm, the moaning dead rise to their feet.*
The necromancer rolls (Intelligence + Occult) against difficulty 1. Success animates a Size 1 battle group of zombies with poor Drill and Might 1. The zombies have a Defining Tie of obedience toward her that can’t be weakened.
The necromancer may improve the battle group’s Size by spending three extra successes per additional dot of Size, maximum (Essence), as long as she has sufficient corpses. Nearly a dozen are required for Size 1 battle groups, while larger numbers might require reanimated the corpses strewn across a battlefield or interred within a graveyard.
## Control
The necromancer may raise a Size 1 battle group of zombies without nearby corpses, calling ancient dead from the ground beneath her feet. Battle groups of reanimated zombies under her command possess average Drill. Wherever she goes, corpses groan and shift where they lie, their final rest disturbed by her passing.
## Distortion (15)
Distortion weakens the necromancer’s bindings. She rolls (Intelligence + Occult) against difficulty (battle group’s Size + 1). Failure causes the battle group to lose a point of Size. If the battle group is Size 1, it instead suffers levels of damage equal to the distorting spellcaster’s (Essence), plus an additional level for each success the necromancer failed by.
