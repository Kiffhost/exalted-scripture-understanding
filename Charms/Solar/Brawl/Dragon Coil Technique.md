The Solar wraps her mighty arms around an opponent and attempts to crush the life from him. The Solar gains (Essence) automatic successes to land a grapple attack, and on the control roll, she treats the opponent’s 10s as her own single successes. In addition, when the Solar controls a clinch with Dragon Coil Technique, her withering and decisive savaging attacks and slams enjoy (Essence) bonus dice of damage. The Exalt can choose whether this damage is bashing or lethal. In addition, if the Exalt uses Dragon Coil Technique to defend herself from a grapple and wins control, she can keep control of the grapple rather than merely escaping. Finally, if the Solar uses her (Strength + Brawl) to land a grapple attack, Dragon Coil Technique expressly allows the Solar to grapple characters of prodigious size—tyrant lizards, river dragons, siaka and other similarly sized beasts are all valid targets for the Solar’s dread grasp. However, creatures of truly titanic proportions such as Juggernaut or Mount Mostath can only be gripped in bits and pieces, with the most likely result being that the Solar tears away a massive chunk of her opponent, rather than being able to exert enough force to hold or throw such a gigantic being.
