Perdurant Vault — a reflective disc of milk-white jade — emerged from the workshop of the occultist Ragara Lasime during his family’s solidification as “the Imperial Bank.” Among the innumerable deals House Ragara struck during that climb, Lasime sojourned to the Underworld to treat with the ghost-queen Hymn of Shackles, whose consortium once monopolized earthly goods passing through Stygia. No one knows what Lasime offered, but the fruits of his workshop display what he gained. Four feet in diameter and strung with an obsidian chain, this ornate aegis complements high-society fashion, offering Evocations that shield the wielder from Dynastic intrigue. Its polished surface occasionally reflects glimpses of an ethereal city, a secret world hidden within its depths. Perdurant Vault has been wielded by bureaucrats, sorcerers, and politicians of House Ragara, and seen use in occult experiments conducted by the house’s inner circle. It’s often entrusted to scions carrying out important matters for the house that require the utmost discretion and incorruptible will.
