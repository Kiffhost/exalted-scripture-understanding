The Sidereal guises herself in many seemings, her resplendent destinies shining like stars in the constellation of herself. When the Sidereal makes an influence roll, it benefits from any of her target’s Intimacies that would apply if she were any of her inactive resplendent destinies. If her influence roll beats a target’s [[Guile]], she learns what those Intimacies are.
