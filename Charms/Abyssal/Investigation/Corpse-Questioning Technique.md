*Invoking the Old Laws’ authority, Death’s Lawgiver compels the testimony of the dead.*
As the Abyssal examines a corpse, she rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Investigation]]) against the [[Resolve]] it had in life. She may face penalties if a great deal of time has passed since it’s death or if it’s in poor condition, but if she can overcome these, it’s possible to wrench answers from corpses that are no more than skulls.
Success revives an echo of the corpse’s selfhood, though little of its personality remains. The Abyssal can ask the corpse one question, plus an addition question for each extra success. Corpses’ memories of their lives fade rapidly. A freshly-slain corpse remembers only the last (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) days of its life.
After a day, this is reduced to (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) hours, then that many minutes once a second day has passed. Once a third day passes, the corpse can only remember its final moments. Corpses can also recall events in their immediate surroundings from the last (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) days.
Against a zombie or other reanimated corpse, the Abyssal doesn’t roll. Instead of this Charm’s usual effect, it stirs the zombie’s lingering selfhood and lets the deathknight question it through normal social influence or [[Charms]] like [[Unsurpassed Interrogation Method]], even if it’s mindless.
## Reset 
Once per scene. This Charm can’t be used on the same corpse more than once.
