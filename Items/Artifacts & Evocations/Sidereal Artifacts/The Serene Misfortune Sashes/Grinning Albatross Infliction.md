Loosening a knot from the sash’s Essence, the wearer shunts her future misery onto someone else. Once per session when she uses Tomorrow’s Troubles Defense, the wearer may pay a one Willpower surcharge to foist her bad luck on a target within short range. If her Essence is higher than the target’s, this happens automatically; otherwise, it requires a contested (Wits + Integrity) roll, with the wearer gaining −1 target number. Success subjects the target to the misfortune instead; failure resets this Charm.
