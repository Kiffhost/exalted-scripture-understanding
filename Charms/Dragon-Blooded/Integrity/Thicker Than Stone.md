One could sooner grind a mountain to dust than turn the Dragon-Blood against her allies. Against influence that opposes one of her positive Ties to another  Dragon-Blood, a family member, or a subordinate under her command, she add ([[Intimacy]]/2, round down) [[Resolve]] as a non-Charm bonus. Successfully resisting the influence grants her a point of [[Willpower]]. This Charm can only be used to protect a given [[Intimacy|Tie]] once per story.
