*The Lawgiver moves with the speed of a striking hawk to intercept a blow with one of her own.*
This Charm allows the Solar to make a reflexive [[Melee]] clash attack against an attack directed at her, regardless of her place in the [[Initiative]] order. This does not count as the Solarâ€™s combat action. The rules for clash attacks can be found on page 202.
