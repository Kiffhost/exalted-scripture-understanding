The sorcerer can roll (Intelligence + {Linguistics or Lore}) at difficulty 2 to mark her skin with carefully devised sigils and formulae over several hours, binding her to one spell. She gains a pool of sorcerous motes equal to her extra successes, which can only be spent on the bound spell. If binding herself to a control spell, she adds (higher of Essence or 3) non-Charm dice on the roll. She can only be bound to one spell at a time and can’t roll more than once a day.
