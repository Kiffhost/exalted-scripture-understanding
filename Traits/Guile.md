The [[Guile]] trait represents a character’s ability to conceal his thoughts and innermost feelings. A character with high [[Guile]] reveals little about himself through his expression, posture, and speech, while a character with low [[Guile]] wears his heart (and [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]) on his sleeve. A character’s [[Guile]] rating is the difficulty for actions that attempt to figure out his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], emotions, or thoughts. [[Guile]] is calculated as the character’s ([[Manipulation]] + [[Socialize]] + specialty] / 2, round up). **Guile is typically used to defend against the [[Read Intentions]] action.**
