*The Abyssal has come to expect crime and vice from those around her and rarely finds herself disappointed.*
Whenever a character the Abyssal can perceive makes a Larceny roll, she is intuitively aware of this fact and adds (Essence) non-Charm dice on an Awareness or Investigation roll to detect this use of Larceny. She also gains this benefit when a disguised character attempts to do something he couldn’t without the benefit of the disguise — such as walking past guards keeping out all but a select few — even if he doesn’t roll Larceny.
