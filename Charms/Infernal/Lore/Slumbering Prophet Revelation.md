*The Infernal has seen the shape of things to come and the horrors that the future holds. As she wakes, her nightmares become reality.*

The Infernal descends into sleep for this Charm’s duration as she dreams of a calamity to befall whatever region she’s in. She makes an (Intelligence + Lore) roll at difficulty of her choice, depending on the severity of calamity she wishes to unleash. Her player should work with the Storyteller to determine the calamity’s exact nature, with increased consequences depending on the number of extra successes rolled:
- **Difficulty 5**: A natural disaster with significant local consequences: an earthquake, a tidal wave, a plague of locusts wiping out harvests across the region.
- **Difficulty 7**: A natural disaster on a grand scale or a terrible supernatural cataclysm: a city-killing volcanic eruption, a storm like that of the Typhoon of Nightmares (p. XX), a large forest and its flora and fauna transforming into a hellish ecosystem that poses a threat to the entire region.
- **Difficulty 10**: A direful calamity falls on a region: a city falling into the Demon Realm, a rampaging behemoth trampling kingdoms underfoot, the appearance of an unbound Third Circle demon eager to wreak havoc.

While the Infernal sleeps, others in the region share her dreams, and strange omens and prodigies herald the coming disaster. Characters can recognize that something awful is coming with a difficulty 3 ({Intelligence or Perception} + Occult) roll. Rolling an extra success lets them discern that the calamity will be caused by someone in the region. Three extra successes let them discern the distance and direction to the Infernal, while five extra successes reveal her precise location. If she’s slain before the calamity is complete or chooses to awaken prematurely, the disaster is averted.
