*Force builds force, rising in a devastating crescendo of hammer-falls.*
This Evocation supplements a smash attack. On a successful roll, she spins rapidly in place, using the power of her first strike to whirl around and deliver another immediately before the opponent has flown back a range band. If the attack was withering, she rolls the attack’s damage a second time to represent this second blow’s force. A decisive attack adds ([[Strength]]) bonus dice of damage. The smash attack knocks the enemy back two range bands. 
This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by spending 3+ charges to use [[Mammoth Slam Quake]] and beating the opposed roll of a significant enemy. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation.
