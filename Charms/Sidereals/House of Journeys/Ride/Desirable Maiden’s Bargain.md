*The Sidereal reveals the truths that drive her, spreading them on wind and whisper, in exchange for Mercury’s guidance.*
Outdoors, in the dim before dawn or the dark of a storm, the Sidereal may use this Charm while performing a task, responsibility, or mission. The Storyteller asks her player a question related to that task and her reasons for doing it. If she gives an honest answer, fate conspires to reveal it to whomever that information is most dramatically relevant to. In exchange, sunrise or lightning-flash reveals the location of somewhere nearby where the Sidereal can find a clue, companion, tool, or other benefit that will meaningfully advance her progress. She and her Circle gain −1 target number on [[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], or [[Survival]] rolls to reach or find that location or the revealed benefit.
