The Lawgiver is the guardian of the peace. With this Charm she empowers herself to grant pre-emptive powers to her allies and subordinates. Any time the Exalt uses read intentions to notice hostile intentions which might result in violence, she gains three non-Charm dice to her Awareness for detecting a trap or assassination attempt, as well as three non-Charm dice to her next Join Battle roll. She may also confer this bonus to her allies through discreet warning at least one round before any hostile action occurs.
