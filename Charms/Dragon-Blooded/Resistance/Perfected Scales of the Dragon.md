The Dragon-Blood settles into a deep-rooted stance, will and Essence hardening her body into an impervious form with an almost crystalline sheen. She gains Hardness equal to ([Essence + Stamina] x2) against all decisive attacks until her next turn. This doesn’t stack with Hardness from armor, but is compatible with Hardness granted by Resistance Charms. Whenever a decisive attack is negated by her Hardness, her attacker doesn’t reset to base Initiative; instead, he loses Initiative as though he’d missed, which she gains. Such is the focus required by this Charm that the Dragon-Blood cannot attack or move on her next turn after using it, although she may still take other miscellaneous actions.
