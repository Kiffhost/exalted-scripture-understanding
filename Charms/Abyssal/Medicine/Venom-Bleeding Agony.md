*Even the foulest of toxins shudder before the Abyssal, fleeing from her patient’s veins.*
The Abyssal makes a roll to [[Treating Poison|treat poison]] reflexively, without facing increased difficulty for rushing. As long as she rolls enough successes to reduce the poison’s duration by at least one, she can purge the toxin entirely, causing it to seep from the patient’s eyes and mouth as a black, tarry discharge. If its remaining duration exceeds her successes, her patient suffers one final interval of the poison’s damage.
