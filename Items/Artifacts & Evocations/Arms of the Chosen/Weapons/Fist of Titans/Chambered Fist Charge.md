*The wielder draws from Creation’s dragon lines to store up power that patiently waits to be unleashed.*
She takes an [[Aim]] action (Exalted, p. 196), building up one charge. Each charge adds +1 to raw damage on the hammer’s withering attacks. She may stack up to ([[Essence]]) charges, plus one per earth-aspected hearthstone slotted into [[Fist of Titans]]. 

## Resonant

This Evocation may be repurchased at [[Essence]] 3, granting two charges per use.
