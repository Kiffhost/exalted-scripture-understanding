Embody all possibilities, commit to none. The stylist may pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses this style’s Form to gain the following benefits: 
-  She gains a second bonus dot of Perception. 
-  When attacking enemies through their reflection, she can strike out to (Essence) range bands away. 
-  The Form and this style’s other Charms are Mute. 
-  When she uses the Form to clash an attack, she may reflexively use Glimpse of Infinity, Splintered Ego Nemesis, or Vanished Within the Glass instead of making a normal attack, waiving their Willpower cost.
