*Only the greatest of challenges are worth the full measure of the Infernal’s might.*

The Infernal doubles 9s on a feat of strength. She doubles 8s if the feat requires Strength 5+ and doubles 7s if it requires Strength 10+. She can instantly complete feats that normally take an extended period of time, if the Storyteller deems it feasible. Even if not, the time required to complete it is dramatically accelerated.

If the feat supports one of the Infernal’s negative Intimacies, she may add (Intimacy) non-Charm dice on the roll. Doing so strengthens that Intimacy by one step if she succeeds.
