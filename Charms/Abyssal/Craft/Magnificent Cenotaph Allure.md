*The Abyssal artist creates works of haunting passion and heartbreaking beauty.*
Upon completing a [[Craft]] project to create a painting, sculpture, or similar work of art, the Abyssal imbues it with emotion, rolling a ({[[Charisma]] or [[Manipulation]]} + [[Craft]]) [[inspire]] roll. A character viewing the object for the first time is exposed to this influence. Ghosts are especially susceptible to such powerful passions, suffering −1 [[Resolve]] against the Abyssal’s art. Alternatively, she can convey an [[instill]] roll to create either a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] or a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward herself or to the undead in general. The embedded influence lingers for ([[Essence]]) weeks after this Charm ends.
The Abyssal can use this Charm on up to ([[Essence]]) objects at a time.
With a [[Craft]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal may use this Charm on anything she crafts, as long as she incorporates artistic or ornamental elements into it.
