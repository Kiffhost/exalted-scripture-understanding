The Dragon-Blooded shipwright Zhalk Zhova built Conquering Tide for his lover, the justiciar-prince Windon-Cresting-Foam, instilling it with his beloved’s famed zeal for justice so that it might bear her and her famed warstrider, the Walking Gallows, to wherever injustice might hide. Pirates, criminals, and corrupt officials learned to fear the sight of the warship’s sails, knowing whose coming they foretold — she who sank the serpent-fleet of the corsair Malkin Stormtooth; who wrung truth from the lips of the Demon of Hollow; who captured the barque of the renegade sorcerer Orrey before he could flee to the Wyld’s waters.
After the Usurpation, numerous Shogunate gentes claimed Conquering Tide as their own, citing their descent from either Wind-on-Cresting-Foam or Zhalk Zhova. It was lost to all of them in the aftermath of the disastrous Second Campaign against Bluehaven, remaining in Lintha hands for centuries until Peleps Dafan seized it after a decisive sea-battle.
Peleps Lai captained Conquering Tide into the heart of Jill-of-the-Nine-Lives’ living ship to rescue those enslaved within. Peleps Lymidia commanded it at the Battle of Frozen Sails, driving back the forces of the Anathema Fever Stone. Peleps Arakari brought judgment to the Avata pirate family, ending their bloody dominance of the Quiver Coast.
Conquering Tide is a huge triple-masted man-of-war.
Nigh-imperishable timbers from long-vanished islands comprise the hull, masts, and deck, all of which have been lacquered with black jade. These stand in brilliant contrast to stark white sails laced with orichalcum thread.

## Evocations of Conquering Tide

As long as Conquering Tide’s only cargo is a warstrider, it still receives the Speed bonus from empty cargo holds.
Such a warstrider’s pilot may pay five motes to launch it from within the ship, ascending two range bands vertically and up to three range bands horizontally without taking falling damage. This is a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried and counts as a movement action.
