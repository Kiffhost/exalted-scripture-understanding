The Dragon-Blood is as inevitable in her pursuit as a raging wildfire, yet elegant as a dancing tongue of flame. She rolls to rush an enemy from short range with double 9s. On a success, she instantly moves into close range with her foe, instead of the usual effect of a rush. The Dragon-Blood may pay one Willpower and expend her Fire Aura when she uses this Charm to rush a foe from medium range.
