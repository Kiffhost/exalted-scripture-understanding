The Sidereal weeps tears of tears of blood, pouring herself into the unknowable other. The Sidereal makes a special (Charisma + Presence) persuade roll against a single target. If successful, she seizes a foothold in his mind, choosing a specific type of decision — e.g., “decisions involving romance,” “decisions involving Vanehan politics,” “decisions made while drunk.” When he’s faced with such a decision, the Sidereal becomes aware of his circumstances and may intervene as per Force Decision. Once she’s done so (Essence) times, this Psyche effect ends. This Charm’s cost is reduced by five motes against characters with an Intimacy instilled by Impose Nature or who’re affected by Presence-in-Absence Technique or Ego-Shattering Reminiscence. This discount remains even if the Intimacy is removed or the Charm ends. Reset: This Charm can only be used against a character once per story.
