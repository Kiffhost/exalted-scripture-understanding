*The Lunar’s [[Essence]] shifts within her panoply, drawing forth new manifestations of its legend.*
After a few minutes of meditation, she awakens an Evocation at no experience point cost from an artifact she’s resonant with or a hearthstone, available for this Charm’s duration. She must meet the Evocation’s prerequisites. If the Lunar loses resonance with an artifact — potentially with [[Deadly Beastman Transformation]] — this Charm ends. This Charm can only be used once per day.
