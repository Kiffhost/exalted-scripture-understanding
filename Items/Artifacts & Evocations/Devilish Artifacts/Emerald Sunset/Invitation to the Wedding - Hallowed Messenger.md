*Bequeathed authority over the denizens of Hell, the wielder sends them to bring the word of her glory to her foes.*

The wielder dissolves an allied demon within short range into green-gold light, drawing it into her arrow. She fires it at a point within her weapon’s range, causing the demon to manifest in a burst of emerald flame where it lands. If the demon appears within close range of an opponent, it may make a reflexive attack, which counts as a surprise attack.
### Resonant
The wielder can use this Charm to make a withering or decisive attack with the demon-fused arrow. The demon manifests within close range of the target even if the attack misses, but it may only make a reflexive attack if the attack hits.
