Cloud-Gathering Practice Surpassing her limits, the Exalt weaves a blanket of unnatural fog that engulfs an entire region. This can extend as far as 100 miles in radius, swallowing all but the highest mountaintops. It lasts for weeks or months, no matter the local climate. Crops spoil, predators skulk easily from wilderness to town, vagabonds and refugees travel unseen, and armies can march openly with little chance of discovery. Most magical wind or weather manipulation is incapable of dispersing this fog, but it can be banished with an Ambition 2+ Celestial Circle sorcerous working. A city-sized region can be cleared with an Ambition 2+ Terrestrial working. Mist-Weaving Mastery can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) under the cover of Mistweaver’s fog. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with jade can’t awaken this Evocation. 

## Resonant

The wielder may instead weave a supernatural mist of a sort native to the place and time in which she activates this Evocation, such as freezing fog in the far North, Wyld-mists in the bordermarches, or blood-drenched brume on Calibration. Such weird phenomena are smaller in scale and duration, generally encompassing no more than several square miles and lasting only days.
