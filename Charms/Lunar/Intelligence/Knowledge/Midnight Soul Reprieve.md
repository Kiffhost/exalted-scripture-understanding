Offering insight and understanding to the troubled, the Lunar guides them through their darkest nights. She assists a patient with a Major or Defining Derangement as an extended (Intelligence + [Medicine or Presence]) action, with a one-month interval, difficulty 5, goal number 20, and terminus (10 – intensity). Success lowers the Derangement’s intensity by one step. She need only spend a day each interval interacting with her patient, but each interaction grants the patient (Lunar’s Essence) dice on Willpower rolls against the Derangement and reduces its Resolve penalty by one for a week, making repeat visits beneficial. Addictions can be treated as Major Derangements; success cures them completely. The Lunar can’t remove Minor Derangements, but can still benefit patients with them through interaction, as above. No extended roll is required; the Lunar need only use this Charm once per season and subsequently interact with her patients to confer these benefits. Alternatively, this Charm can be used to fend off a Psyche effect, or a shaping effect or curse that alters the mind, if it can be resisted with Willpower. The Lunar rolls (Intelligence + [Integrity, Occult, or Presence]) at a difficulty of the Essence of the character responsible. Success halves the Willpower cost her patient must pay to resist it, rounded down, and lets the Lunar spend Willpower on his behalf. If an effect requires spending Willpower multiple times to break it, this Charm only applies to one such instance. 
## Protean 

In shapes that her patient has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward, the Lunar doubles 9s on rolls made with this Charm.
