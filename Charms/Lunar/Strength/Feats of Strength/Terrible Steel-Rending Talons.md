*The Lunar snaps steel blades with her bare hands, shatters axe-heads between her teeth, and strikes daiklaves with force enough to break them.*
She makes a disarm gambit, adding ([[Athletics]]) attack roll extra successes as dice on the [[Initiative]] roll. If successful, she destroys her foe’s weapon if it’s mundane. If it’s an artifact, she reflexively rolls a feat of demolition. A single success breaks its wielder’s attunement, while (5 + [[Artifact]] rating; 15 for [[Artifact]] N/As) renders it nonfunctional until repaired (Exalted, p. 242). Weapons created by [[Charms]], like [[Glorious Solar Saber]], are unaffected. If the Lunar uses [[Shell-Crushing Persistence]] (p. XX) to break an enemy’s attunement to artifact armor, she may reflexively activate this Charm, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost, to attempt a feat of demolition to damage it. This Charm can only be used once per day.
