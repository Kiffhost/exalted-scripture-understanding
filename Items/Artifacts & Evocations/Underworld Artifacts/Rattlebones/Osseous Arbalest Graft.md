*Rattlebones grafts itself onto one of its wielder’s arms, gruesomely melding flesh and bone.*
[[Rattlebones]] merges with its wielder, making it impossible to disarm and granting it the One-Handed tag.
Fed by its wielder, the crossbow can produce endless bolts of sharpened bone, providing its own ammunition. The wielder can’t use the hand that [[Rattlebones]] is merged with for anything else.
If the wielder has other magic capable of producing ammunition, like [[Relic Arrow Method]] (p. XX), she waives this Evocation’s health level cost.
## Dissonant
