The Sidereal rumples the strands of her fate in a flash of glittering green sparks, affecting the disreputable demeanor of the romantic outlaw. Criminals who interact with the Sidereal count as having a Minor Tie of admiration to her. If characters interacting with her have any negative Ties toward criminals or those condemned by a ruler, government, or religion, those Ties are treated as one step weaker with regard to her.
