*The Infernal’s avarice consumes all that can be known of someone, gnawing away at their identity and their place in the world.*

The Infernal devours an aspect of a touched character’s identity, making a special (Manipulation + Larceny) instil roll against him. She can use Charms that enhance pickpocketing on this roll. Success eats away at an aspect of his social identity. This might be a position of authority, his standing in a cultural hierarchy, a formal or socially-recognized relationship, his reputation, or a similar aspect of his social life or public persona. If the Infernal publicly undermined or mocked that facet of the target’s identity in the same scene, she doubles 9s.

If successful, anyone who interacts with the victim is exposed to the Infernal’s influence, which weakens any Ties to the victim that involve the chosen aspect of his identity or similar Intimacies. Additionally, affected characters’ memories of the victim are distorted to make it seem as if he never had that aspect of his identity. The victim’s husband remembers their love, but not the fact that they were married; a general’s troops recall him as an arrogant and overbearing comrade, not their leader. Exposed characters become immune to influence from subsequent interactions for a week.

A character can spend one Willpower to prevent his Intimacies from being weakened by the Infernal’s influence. Characters who have direct evidence that their memories have been altered can spend one Willpower to restore them, plus an additional point of Willpower for every two extra successes the Infernal rolled over the original target’s Resolve, maximum five. This is separate from preserving Intimacies.

Once per week, the victim can pay one Willpower to reassert his identity after undergoing significant hardship or sacrifice to rebuild a relationship, uncover evidence of the truth, convince others their memories have been altered, or the like. Doing so reduces the Willpower cost of restoring memories by one point for all affected characters. Once it’s reduced to zero, the victim is freed from this Charm, though other affected characters must still be prompted to recall their memories.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she uses [[Crown-Seizing Sneer]], making a single roll for both Charms. [[Ego-Devouring Enmity]] assails both the stolen position of authority and one other aspect of the victim’s identity.
## [[Keys]]
#### Identity Theft Digestion (Essence 5)
The Infernal can commit this Charm’s cost to digest and subsume her victim’s social identity. In addition to the above, the Infernal’s influence applies to anyone who interacts with her, making them believe she possesses that aspect of his identity. Affected characters are instilled with a Tie to the Infernal whose context fits this belief, and their memories are distorted to match. A character only needs to spend Willpower to restore their memories once, even if affected by exposure to both the victim and the Infernal. This ends if the victim breaks free of this Charm.
