The Lunar devours a malaise afflicting her patient. She rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) against a poison’s remaining duration or a disease’s morbidity. Success instantly cures her patient, but transfers the poison’s remaining duration or the disease into the Lunar, without allowing a (Stamina + Resistance) roll. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a carrion-feeder may learn this as a Stamina Charm, with either Disease-Purging Essence or Scorpion-and-Toad Absolution (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
