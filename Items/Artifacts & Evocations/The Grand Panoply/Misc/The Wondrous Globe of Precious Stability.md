*Only a handful of these rare and precious artifacts survived the First Age.*
They are all jade spheres the size of small human head, covered in dozens of complex occult symbols inlaid with orichalcum, moonsilver, starmetal and soulsteel, with socket for a hearthstone on top and mounting brackets that can unfold from the bottom. Activating this artifact requires either placing a standard hearthstone in the socket or for one of the Exalted to commit ten motes to attune it. A hearthstone used in this fashion provides no other benefits. 

Once activated, the sphere begins to glow and rotate. Then, either the Exalt who committed [[Essence]] to it can command it to orbit around her or someone can mount it on a vehicle or building. If orbiting around an Exalt, it protects everyone and everything within Short range from the effects of the Wyld. In addition, every creature or object inside this radius gains five dice to resist any [[Charms]] used by one of the Fair Folk and none of the Fair Folk can enter the protected area or affect the artifact in any fashion.

If attached to a vehicle or building, it protects the entire structure and everyone inside it in the same manner. This artifact can be used to protect any vehicle, including the largest First Age ship. Alternately, it can be attached to any single building that is no larger than the Imperial Palace or one of the sealed towers of the city of Rathess. However, it cannot be used to protect an entire city or even a large town.
