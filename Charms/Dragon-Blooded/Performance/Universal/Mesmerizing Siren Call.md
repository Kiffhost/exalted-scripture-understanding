Ascintillatingfacadeofbeautyandgraceconcealshidden depths of danger. The Dragon-Blood rolls (Manipulation +Performance),rerollingalldicethatinitiallyshownon-1 failures. Each character whose Resolve is beaten by this roll is hypnotized by the performance. The Exalt may spend her threshold successes over a given character’s Resolve to impose one or more illusions from the following list on him for as long as she continues to perform. If she affects multiple characters, she may inflict different illusions on each, though groups of minor targets should be combined into audiences (Exalted, p. 223). 0 Successes The target perceives phantasmal imagery, sounds, or scents, but is aware that they’re unreal. 1 Success The target perceives a single illusory entity or object, up to roughly the size of a person or horse, and believes it to be real. This cannot imitate a specific character. 2 Successes The target perceives an illusory duplicate of an existing, human-sized character that the Exalt knows, and believes it to be real. 2 Successes One individual within medium range, no larger than a human, is concealed from the target’s senses. He cannot perceive the concealed character, even if she takes overt actions that would normally draw his attention, although she’s revealed if she attacks him. 3 Successes The target perceives a single large illusory entity, object, or structure, up to the size of a house or tyrant lizard, and believes it to be real. This can imitate a specific character. The Dragon-Blood can take other actions while continuing the performance by flurrying them with a miscellaneous action to continue performing. Illusions created with this Charm act as the Exalt wills them to, but cannot physically interact with the world. If a figment engages the target in social influence, it uses the Exalt’s dice pools, but she cannot enhance its rolls with her magic. If a victim of this Charm discovers evidence that what he’s perceiving isn’t real, he can spend two Willpower to resist, breaking free of all illusions. Walking into an unreal fire and discovering it doesn’t burn, being attacked by an enemy concealed behind an illusory wall, or noticing a discrepancy in an illusory impostor’s behavior would all provide such an opportunity. In addition, he may resist if the illusions would cause him to act against or fail to protect one of his Major or Defining Intimacies. Mesmerizing Siren Call can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) through deception.
