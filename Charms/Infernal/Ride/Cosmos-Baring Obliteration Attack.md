*The Infernal and her mount collapse together into a sphere of pure darkness, hemmed with baleful stars. Where they pass, nothing remains.*

The Infernal’s mount rolls a feat of demolition as it moves up to three range bands straight forward, demolishing unattended objects or structures that it passes within short range of during this movement. Its effective Strength and its successes are doubled for demolishing restraints that hold it back or obstacles in its way.

The feat is also treated as the attack roll for a grapple gambit against all enemies that the mount passed within short range of during its movement — even battle groups and Legendary Size foes. Enemies can’t oppose the control roll of a successful grapple, as if the mount had Legendary Size (p. XX). Grappled enemies are pulled into the depths of an infinite crushing void, a darkness lit only by distant stars of the Infernal’s anima. This exposure is a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 5L.

After this, the mount makes a decisive throw attack against all grappled enemies, expelling them forcefully from the void. Each attack has a base damage of (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3), plus any damage added by the mount’s rounds of control. The mount’s Initiative is divided evenly among them, rounded up. She adds her full Initiative instead against battle groups, who aren’t counted in dividing up Initiative.
