The Lawgiver sees every angle for attack and counterattack, her every parry and strike building on one another to make her unassailable. While using this Charm, every time the Exalt successfully parries, she gains a number of motes equal to the difference between her Parry and the attackâ€™s successes plus one. These motes can only be used to fuel [[Melee]] [[Charms]], and vanish at the end of her next action. Victorious Wreath has a one [[Initiative]] per round upkeep, and if the Solar is crashed, the Charm is broken and the full cost must be paid again if she wishes to reinstate it. A repurchase of this Charm allows an Exalt using [[Ready in Eight Directions Stance]] to keep their [[Initiative]] from returning to base at the end of the round, so long as they successfully parry every attack launched at them during the round while using Victorious Wreath. On Victorious Wreath (Against the World Stance) The backer wanted a [[Melee]] Charm for use by his Solar, the Invincible Sword Princess. He wanted Princess to have a Charm that would help her deal with focus fire from a group of opponents, so I came up with an effect that would defray the cost of continual use of Dipping Swallow [[Defense]] or [[Ready in Eight Directions Stance]]. I imagine fighting the Invincible Sword Princess to be like trying to fight someone who is wreathed in [[Essence]] and steel and able to move faster than light. Thus you have Victorious Wreath, or the more narrative Against the World Stance. Backer: Jye Nicolson
