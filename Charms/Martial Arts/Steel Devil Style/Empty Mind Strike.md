This Charm is an attack similar to [[Steel Devil Strike]], occurring after [[Double [[Attack]] Technique]].
This Charm can only be triggered when the damage done by [[Double [[Attack]] Technique]] is equal to or greater than the amount of Offhand Charge capacity that has yet to be filled with Charge. However, unlike [[Steel Devil Strike]], this attack expends Charge instead of gathered [[Initiative]] to create the attackâ€™s damage pool. In addition, if the Steel Devil expends all her Charge in this attack, the damage roll gains ([[Essence]]) bonus dice. Alternately, the Exalt may choose to use this attack after unleashing a [[Steel Devil Strike]] that does at least half her current Charge (rounded down) in successful damage.
