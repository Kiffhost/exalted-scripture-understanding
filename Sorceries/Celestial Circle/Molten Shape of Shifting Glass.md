*The Hyaline Bloom sought to shine like the sun, but shattered beneath the weight of such magnificence.*
As the sorcerer recites an ode to it, she takes on its nature, becoming a thing of living, liquid glass that shimmers with molten heat. This transformation grants the sorcerer the following benefits: 
- She can ignite or melt mundane materials with a touch, requiring a miscellaneous action. Against an object that’s in use by someone, this requires a difficulty 3 unarmed gambit. 
- She can flow through any opening that isn’t watertight. This always ignites or melts mundane materials surrounding the opening. 
- Grapple gambits against her suffer a −4 penalty on the attack and control rolls. They fail automatically unless enhanced by magic. 
- An enemy who hits her with an unarmed attack or spends a round grappling her suffers (her [[Essence]]) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]].
The sorcerer also gains the following powers while transformed: 
#### Jagged Shard Revenge
(5m; Reflexive; Instant; Counterattack, Decisive-only)
When the sorcerer is dealt lethal damage by an attack at close range, she may use this power to make a ([[Stamina]] + [[Occult]]) decisive counterattack as her shed blood turns to shards of glass. This deals (her [[Essence]]) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]], and doesn’t reset her [[Initiative]]. 
#### Unseen in Stillness
(3m; Supplemental; Indefinite)
As the sorcerer makes a [[Stealth]] roll, she sheds all heat from her glassy form to become completely translucent, but immobile. 1s and 2s subtract successes on opposing [[Awareness]] rolls, and they fail automatically unless enhanced by magic. However, taking any physical action breaks this concealment. 
#### Glass-Bending Flourish
(4m; Supplemental; Instant; Uniform)
The sorcerer stretches her sinuous limbs of glass to take a physical action at short range.
## Control
The sorcerer’s hands glow from within with molten light, though this can be hidden with gloves or similar. They count as exceptional equipment for tasks involving smithing, cooking, glassblowing, etc. This spell’s duration becomes one day. 
## Distortion
(10)
The sorcerer’s body cools and becomes brittle. She suffers a −2 penalty on [[Strength]] and [[Dexterity]] rolls and counts as being in difficult terrain.
