The Lunar draws upon the ancient oaths, pacts, and covenants recorded in the seal’s ink-blood, imprisoning spirits within cages of law and language.
The Lunar can pay a five-mote surcharge to enhance Argent Sphinx Enigma (p. 47) when she uses it against a spirit or fae. Rather than telling a riddle, she vexes her foe with binding words. Gods and elementals obsess over complex issues of heavenly law, while demons are trapped in contemplation of their place in the surrender oaths of the Yozis. Ghosts are overcome by the words they once spoke in life, speaking seemingly nonsensical statements in fits of ecstatic passion. The Fair Folk are burdened by memories of every oath they’ve ever sworn, each promise a link in their chains.
This Evocation has the follow benefits:
 - The Lunar can roll with Bureaucracy or Linguistics in addition to the usual Abilities.
 - The Lunar doesn’t choose an area of expertise when she uses this Evocation. Her target gains no benefit from succeeding on the opposed roll, and the penalty he suffers if he fails applies on all rolls he makes.
 - If the Lunar’s Initiative roll successes equal or exceed her target’s Essence, he’s overwhelmed by the binding, effectively incapacitating him for the rest of the scene. He breaks free of this if attacked, though he still suffers the Charm’s other effects.
 - If a character fails his opposed roll against the Charm, the difficulty of subsequent rolls to break free of the binding increases to 7. If he flurries this roll with another action, the penalties on both rolls subtract successes instead of dice.
