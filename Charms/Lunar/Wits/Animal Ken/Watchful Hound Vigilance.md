The Lunar’s familiar is an ever-faithful sentinel. When she and her familiar Join Battle or roll Awareness to detect a concealed threat, both use the higher result of their two rolls. If the Lunar and her familiar win Join Battle and her familiar makes a decisive attack on its first turn, it doesn’t reset to base Initiative if successful.
