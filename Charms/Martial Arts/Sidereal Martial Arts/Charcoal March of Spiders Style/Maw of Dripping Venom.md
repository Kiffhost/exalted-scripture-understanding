*The martial artist strikes her foe like a thousand venomous fangs, tainting her victim’s Essence and dissolving his soul from the inside out.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have Initiative 15+. 
She makes a decisive attack. A damaged enemy suffers a poison with duration (stylist’s Essence + levels of damage inflicted) rounds and a −3 penalty. Instead of taking damage, at each interval, he rolls (Sidereal’s Essence) dice and loses motes equal to his successes. If he doesn’t have enough motes, excess successes instead inflict that many levels of aggravated damage. If this poison incapacitates a character, he falls comatose. The stylist may touch him to devour his soul, killing him instantly and permanently and granting her (his Essence x10) motes. Human souls devoured this way don’t pass on to Lethe. 
## Enlightenment
When the martial artist devours a victim’s soul, she may absorb his memories. She can’t eidetically recall every moment of his life, remembering only to the extent that he did. This only conveys memories of events, not skills, though she may rely on his memories as a mentor for mundane traits (Exalted, p. 178). However, in doing so, she gains one of the target’s Intimacies, chosen by the Storyteller, at the same intensity he had it at. She can’t willingly erode this Intimacy for the rest of the story.
