To speak lies before a Dragon-Blood is to foul the air with one’s breath. The Dragon-Blood may reflexively roll to profileacharacterwhenshehearshimmakeastatement, adding (Essence) non-Charm bonus dice. A successful roll reveals whether that character was attempting to be deceptive or misleading with his statement. It doesn’t reveal what parts of the statement are untrue. Once the Dragon-Blood has caught a character lying, she waives the Willpower cost of any subsequent activations against that character in the same scene.
