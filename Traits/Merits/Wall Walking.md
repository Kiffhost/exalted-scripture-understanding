The character gains the ability to cling to, as well as walk or crawl across, walls and even ceilings. Ceilings and inherently slick surfaces with little purchase (such as Chiaroscuro glass) count as difficult terrain.
### Drawback
The characterâ€™s hands and feet become visibly nonhuman, possibly sporting sticky suction pads, tiny climbing claws, or spurs like a lizard.
