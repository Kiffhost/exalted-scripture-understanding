Rats-in-the-Basement Style The Lunar walks many hidden roads, roaming her dominion in secret or retreating to her lair unseen.
The Lunar can use this Charm’s prerequisites together for four motes, one [[Willpower]] to reveal a a path to a faraway territory or lair. She makes a single ([[Wits]] + [Sail or Survival]), doubling 9s and adding (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice. The roll’s difficulty is 7 for a route of up to ([[Essence]] x10) miles or 10 for a route of up to ([[Essence]] x 100) miles. She can’t go any further than that.
Success introduces a secret route, which is concealed as per [[Secure Den Technique]] (Lunars, p. 293), and lets the Lunar bank her successes as per [[Lodestone Reckoning Manner]]. Such routes include many supernaturally advantageous shortcuts, halving the time necessary to complete the journey. This is compatible with the speed increase from [[Charms]] like [[Monarch-Wing Migration]].
It’s difficult to keep such routes secret for long. The path remains concealed as above for however long it would take the Lunar to complete the journey on foot, without using shapeshifting or any other magic. Once this time elapses, the concealment fades. The route also loses its concealment if the Lunar ends her mote commitment. When concealment fades, the travel time reduction is also lost.
If the Lunar knows [[Ranging Wolf Deception]] (Lunars, p. 288), she waives its [[Willpower]] cost while traveling along a concealed path.
