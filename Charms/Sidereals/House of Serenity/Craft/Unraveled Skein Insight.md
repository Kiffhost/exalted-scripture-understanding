*All the world is the Siderealâ€™s muse, repaying her for her service in inspiration.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm after a scene spent crafting, seeking to fulfill an auspicious prospect, or opposing enemies of fate. She may exchange silver for gold craft points at a rate of two to one or exchange white for gold or gold for silver at a rate of one to two. Each activation only lets her convert one type of craft points.
