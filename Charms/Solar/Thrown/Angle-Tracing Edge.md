The Solar perceives the angle of her enemyâ€™s attacks as broken arcs of faintly glowing [[Essence]], and uses them to guide her own. Through the use of this Charm, the Exalt completely removes all cover benefits from a target, banking her weapon off of walls and other solid surfaces to make near-impossible attacks. If [[Angle-Tracing Edge]] is used against a target in full cover, unless deemed completely impossible by the Storyteller, her attack finds its mark, but is made as if she had attacked from long distance.
