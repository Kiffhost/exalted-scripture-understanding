*The Dragon-Blood diverts the watchful eyes of the law from her misdeeds, redirecting them in pursuit of endless false leads or of her own foes, like fish swimming against the tide.*
She makes a roll to [[Conceal Evidence]], arranging the scene so that a specific character she knows of is implicated as the perpetrator of whatever actions she took that scene. An investigator who fails his roll to case the scene believes that he’s succeeded, but receives a false clue that points him towards the character the Exalt framed. Even on a successful roll, he still finds the false clue, but also discovers any genuine evidence left behind. He’s aware of the discrepancy, but doesn’t know which clue is false. A character may realize he’s been duped if he turns up enough contradictory evidence. Each time he discovers a clue which contradicts the Dragon-Blood’s deception, he rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Investigation]]) opposing the [[conceal evidence]] roll to realize the discrepancy and identify the clue as false. Even if he fails, he gains a cumulative +1 non-Charm bonus on his roll the next time he discovers a clue. [[Investigation-Deflecting Current]] can only be used once per story, unless the Exalt resets it by conclusively defeating the attempts of a significant character to investigate her crimes.
