The Lunar’s presence forces all other thoughts aside. She rolls against one target to instill a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear or lust toward herself (or her current shape). Success also renders her victim unable to form new memories that don’t relate to the [[Intimacy]], reducing his waking hours to a daydream haze or half-perceived nightmare. This lasts until the instilled [[Intimacy]] is fully eroded. However, while the victim can see the Lunar, he can’t voluntarily erode the [[Intimacy]] and gains +3 [[Resolve]] against attempts to do so. Even while the Lunar isn’t present, he must spend one [[Willpower]] to voluntarily erode it.
