Moving without thought, the Dragon-Blood brutally wrenches an attacker’s limb or weapon aside. When an enemy with lower [[Initiative]] attacks her, she may reflexively clash with a decisive attack or a disarm gambit.
This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. The [[Defense]] penalty imposed by a successful clash (Exalted, p. 202) counts as an onslaught penalty for the purposes of the Dragon-Blood’s and her allies’ offensive [[Charms]].
If the Dragon-Blood knows [[Currents Sweep to Sea]], she may use this Charm to clash attacks from out to medium range as long as there is a source of water on the battlefield, striking with a watery tendril.
