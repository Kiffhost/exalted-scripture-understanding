No power is beyond the Infernal’s reach. She fixates on a goal that is perilous, costly or forbidden, such as knowledge from the glass libraries of Orabilis, attuning to an obviously accursed artifact or ransacking the treasures of a god-queen’s vault. She will pursue this goal at all costs, ignoring any appeal or threat to the contrary.

**Duration**: Session.
Strive for the Forbidden can be ended prematurely if the Infernal seizes her prize or loses more than she stood to gain in pursuit of it.
