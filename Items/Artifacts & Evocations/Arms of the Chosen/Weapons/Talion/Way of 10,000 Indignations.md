The wielder has room in her heart to rage against every injustice. This Evocation may only be activated while the Exalt is pursuing a grievance. When another character offends one of her Major or Defining Intimacies, if no offender is present, she may activate this Evocation to treat him as an offender for purposes of Talion’s Evocations. The Evocation terminates if she reactivates it against another target or if an actual offender enters the scene. 

## Resonant

This Evocation’s cost is waived.
