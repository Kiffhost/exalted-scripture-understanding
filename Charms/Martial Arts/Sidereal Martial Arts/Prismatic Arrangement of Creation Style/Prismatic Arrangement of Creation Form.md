*The martial artist vanishes into the world’s Essence, dancing the dance of all things before returning to the world, at one with it.*
The stylist gains either the benefits of all this style’s other Forms or up to three other Form Charms she knows. If she chooses the latter option, she can only include one Form from a Sidereal Martial Art. She can use Charms that enhance any of the combined Forms, like Conclusion-Pursuing Approach.
Combining Forms of different styles lets the stylist use each style’s weapons and the best of their armor compatibility with each of the other styles. This doesn’t apply to Forms from Abilities other than Martial Arts.
When the stylist satisfies the special activation rules of a Form she knows, she may swap it for one of the chosen Forms as long as it’s still a permissible combination.
The stylist can use this Charm while wearing any kind of armor.
### Enlightenment
Upon entering this Form, the stylist gains one Initiative for each style she’s learned all Charms for (including this one), maximum (Essence + {Lore or Occult}). Sidereals count Archery, Brawl, Melee, and Thrown as completed styles if they’ve learned their prayer strip Charm.
## Special activation rules
When the stylist satisfies a Form Charm’s special activation rules while already in a Form, she can reflexively enter this Form instead. She must include both the initial Form and the one whose condition she met in the Forms she combines.
