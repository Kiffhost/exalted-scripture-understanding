*The early days of the Shogunate saw numerous shortlived Immaculate heresies.*
The jadesmith Aulan Kevia fell in with the adherents of Mela Ascendant. She forged [[Mela’s Coil]] together with a star-eyed emissary of Heaven to celebrate this most martial of draconic incarnations, and wore it in battle against cataphracts and champions of the Five-Dragon Crusade. But despite the armor’s power and potential, Kevia was slain by the crusader Righteous Fire, who took [[Mela’s Coil]] to the Pagoda of Pasiap’s Footstep as a prize. It has since seen use by Immaculate champions in the Wyld Hunt to do battle with insect-winged devils, storm-riding raksha, and the many-winged war forms of the Lunar Anathema. When Righteous Fire fell in battle against the vulture-headed Devourer of Graves, his slayer deliberately incensed his ghost by casting the armor into the depths of the sea. The legend of the lost armor is whispered by Immaculates in both the Realm and Lookshy, and many have launched pilgrimages to reclaim the sacred relic and its miraculous aegis. [[Mela’s Coil]] is cunningly crafted to resemble the long, lean body of a dragon coiled around its wearer’s torso. The vambraces and gauntlets are the dragon’s forelimbs, the helmet its head. The dragon’s eyes are hearthstone sockets. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Mela’s Coil]]

Air [[Essence]] infuses [[Mela’s Coil]]. Heavy as it is, the armor doesn’t impair the wielder’s grace or agility; it imposes no !!mobilitypenalty,andthewearerremainsbuoyantinwateras!! though unarmored. This airy [[Essence]] also extends outward into a thin layer of fresh, clean air. This renders the wearer immune to drowning and to airborne poisons, diseases, and [[environmental hazards]] based on corrosive agents like acid. The wearer may reflexively extend dragon-like claws from the armor’s gauntlets. Treat these as razor claws (Light: +5 ACC, +10 DMG, +0 DEF, OVW 3; Tags: Lethal, [[Brawl]], Concealable, Worn).
