*The Infernal draws on daemoniac inspiration, penning her works in a feverish hand to proclaim the Yozis’ glory.*

The Infernal adds a non-Charm die on a written influence roll, plus an addition non-Charm die for each condition that applies:
- Her influence has a single target.
- Her influence concerns something for which she has a Major or Defining Tie of curiosity, fascination, nostalgia, interest, or the like. This always applies to influence that involves the Yozis, demons, or Hell.
- Her writing takes the form of a story, poem, religious scripture, esoteric text, or autobiographical narrative.
- She writes in Old Realm.

She writes at a feverish pace, able to complete a full page in seconds, though not for works longer than a few pages.
## [[Keys]]
#### Consummate Hellbound Authorship (Linguistics 4)
The Infernal only needs a Minor Tie of fascination or the like to satisfy that condition. Similarly, she can satisfy the Old Realm condition with any language that she has a Linguistics or Lore specialty in.
#### Gospel of the Old Ones (Linguistics 5, Essence 3, [[#Consummate Hellbound Authorship (Linguistics 4)|Consummate Hellbound Authorship]]) (+2m)
For a two-mote surcharge, the dice added by this Charm are converted to non-Charm successes. If the Infernal adds a full Excellency on the roll, she adds two additional non-Charm successes. If she meets at least three conditions, she doesn’t need a full Excellency for this benefit.
#### Primordial Apocrypha Enlightenment (Linguistics 5, Essence 5, [[#Gospel of the Old Ones (Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Consummate Hellbound Authorship (Linguistics 4) Consummate Hellbound Authorship ) (+2m)|Gospel of the Old Ones]])
When the Infernal uses [[#Gospel of the Old Ones (Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Consummate Hellbound Authorship (Linguistics 4) Consummate Hellbound Authorship ) (+2m)|Gospel of the Old Ones]], she rerolls a failed die for each automatic success added by this Charm.
