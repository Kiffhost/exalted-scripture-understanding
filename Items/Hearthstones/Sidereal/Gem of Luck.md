This gem causes everyone within the village, town, or city where itâ€™s is located to be resistant to bad luck. Dropped plates are less likely to break, lost items are easier to find, stray sparks and dropped lanterns are less likely to start large fires and people performing difficulty 1 tasks never botch. This stone has no effect on any forms of deliberate malice and also cannot undo curses or prevent large disasters, unless those disasters were precipitated by a single small accident.
