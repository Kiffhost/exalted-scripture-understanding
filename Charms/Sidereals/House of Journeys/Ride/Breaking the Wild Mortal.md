The Sidereal binds mortals to her fate as easily as she does beasts. The Sidereal can present the Ordained Bridle of Mercury to mortals. If she succeeds on the roll, the mortal will let her place the bridle on him, though he’ll retain no memory of this embarrassing moment. Rather than becoming her familiar, he gains a Minor Tie of familiarity to her that he can’t voluntarily erode unless he spends one Willpower. Dice added by this Intimacy on rolls to resist the Sidereal’s arcane fate are converted to automatic successes; affected trivial characters with can roll to resist it. The Sidereal can let fate provide, specifying an occupation and personality and learning where she can find someone fitting that description to whom she can present the bridle. Alternatively, she can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to present it to a mortal of her choice. If the Sidereal’s target is capable of being ridden by her as her mount — for example, because he’s a quadrupedal mutant — she waives the Willpower surcharge.
