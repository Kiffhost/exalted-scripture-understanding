The talisman serves as a gateway through which the sorcerer may send her presence to distant corners of Creation. Once per day, while wearing the talisman, she may waive the [[Willpower]] costs of a spell that allows her to sense things remotely or project her presence from afar, such as [[Silent Words of Dreams and Nightmares]].
