*Grasping one element with each of her gauntleted hands, the Dragon-Blood weaves them together into a deadly display of power.*
When she uses [[Elemental Bolt Attack]], she may pay a one-mote surcharge to enhance it with the effects of two of the elemental variants she knows, as long as they’re next to each other in the cycle — earth, then wood, then fire, then air, then water, then earth again. If she combines variants that deal bashing or lethal damage, she may choose which type of damage is dealt.
Such uses are aspected toward both elements.
Upon awakening this Evocation, the Dragon-Blood automatically gains one of Elemental Bolt Attack’s elemental variations. If she already knows all five, this Evocation’s experience point cost is instead discounted by three experience.
