Reaching into a mirror, the Lunar pulls her reflection into reality. After several minutes of meditation in her true human shape, she draws her reflection into existence as an immaterial god that’s physically identical to her but reversed left-to-right. It has the following traits: 
-  It shares one Minor, one Major, and one Defining [[Intimacy]] with the Lunar, chosen by her. She may grant the spirit specific memories relevant to these Intimacies, if she wishes. If she doesn’t, it’s a blank slate, not retaining any memories of spirits created with previous uses of this Charm. 
-  It has the Lunar’s Attributes, Abilities, specialties, innate [[Merits]], [[Willpower]], and health track. 
-  It has [[Essence]] (Lunar’s [[Essence]] – 2, minimum 1), and a Personal [[Essence]] pool of (50 + [god’s [[Essence]] x10]) motes. 
-  ItknowsMaterialize(Exalted,p.509),whichcosts half its mote pool, rounded up, and one [[Willpower]]; and Hurry Home, letting it return to the Lunar if she’s within short range of a reflective surface. It can also use [[Mirror Slip Trick]] for free. The first time [[Moon-in-Well Emanation]] is used, the Lunar’s player and the Storyteller should collaboratively design (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) additional spirit [[Charms]] for the reflection. It gains additional [[Charms]] as the Lunar’s [[Essence]] rises, and one Charm at the end of any story in which it played a meaningful role. Spirits created by subsequent activations retain these [[Charms]], rather than receiving new ones. While the spirit exists, the Lunar casts no reflection. If it dies, the Lunar doesn’t regain her reflection until one week passes or the story ends, whichever comes first. If it’s killed by magic capable of permanently destroying spirits, she doesn’t regain her reflection until one season passes or the story ends, whichever comes first. She can’t use this Charm without her reflection.
