No tinder burns hotter than a stolen secret, igniting a blaze that spreads with the swiftness of rumor. To use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must first uncover an embarrassing or damaging secret of another character, one that, if revealed, would have dramatic negative consequences for that character. She may then use this Charm when she reveals his secret to others, rolling (Charisma + Socialize), doubling 8s, to instill a negative Tie toward him or weaken positive Ties towards him. This also instills a negative Tie or weakens positive Ties towards a culture or social group that he belongs to, chosen by the Exalt. Resisting this influence costs (Dragon-Blood’s Essence/2, round up) points of Willpower. For the rest of the story, affected characters gain the benefit of a temporary specialty on any influence roll they make to spread the secret using any social Ability. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) by orchestrating the social downfall of a rival — causing him to lose an official position or social standing, creating a scandal that destroys his reputation, or similar. She can only use this Charm again on the same character by revealing a different secret, even if it resets.
