*Shrouded in subtle portents of the grave, the deathknight moves unnoticed through the herd of the living.*
The Abyssal adds +2 to rolls to notice her trappings of death or their morbid significance and causes opposing characters’ 1s to subtract successes. Characters must make a roll at difficulty 2 for trappings that wouldn’t normally require a roll to recognize. Trivial characters fail automatically.
If the Abyssal uses a disguise to impersonate someone who’s already dead, she counts as wearing trappings of death.
With Larceny 5, Essence 2, opposing rolls’ 2s also subtract successes.
