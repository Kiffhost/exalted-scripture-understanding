With a sudden clap echoed by 98 hidden hands, the stylist adopts an off-kilter stance of chaotic omen. She clashes an attack with a distract gambit, adding attack roll extra successes to the Initiative roll. Winning the clashcountsasdodging,andletsthegambit’sbeneficiary reflexively make a decisive attack against the attacker. Against enemies afflicted by Unitary Being Forge, the stylist can instead clash using a damaging decisive attack, taking the imp’s damage bonus for that round as the attack’s base damage, ignoring Hardness. This doesn’t include or reset her Initiative. It benefits from effects that enhance distract gambits. 
## Terrestrial

This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round and can’t be used if she’s already attacked.
