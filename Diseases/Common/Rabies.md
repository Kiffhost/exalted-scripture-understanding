Victims of rabies suffer from intense thirst, high fevers, and eventually delirium and animalistic frenzy. By that point, death is all but inevitable. The disease is known to originate in the bites of animals who foam at the mouth with madness (though human bites can spread rabies as well), leading many to blame the Lunar Anathema or Wyld taint for the sickness.
