*Similar to its prerequisite, this Charm compels the initiate to a certain belief upon failing a read intentions action.*
Instead of seeing the Lawgiverâ€™s true motives, the target sees her as a route through which he can achieve his goal for the scene. This Charm allows the Solar to gain the confidence of her mark. By acting as a facilitator she may be privy to a number of secrets her target would otherwise not disclose.
