*Gracefully maneuvering around her attackers, the Dragon-Blood lets the force of their blows disperse into the wind.*
She must use the Charm before an attack roll. On a successful dodge, her attacker loses a point of [[Initiative]]. If the attack roll contains any 1s, she may dodge the attack even if its successes equal her [[Defense|Evasion]].
In Air Aura, the Dragon-Blood gains the lost [[Initiative]].
