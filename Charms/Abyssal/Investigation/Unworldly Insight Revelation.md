*The Abyssal seems to know things she couldn’t possibly know, drawing inferences and making deductions beyond mortal reason.*
When the Abyssal succeeds on a case scene or profile character roll, she uncovers an additional clue for each extra success. This won’t necessarily solve the entire mystery with one good roll — the clues she receives should either involve the evidence she examines and how it relates to what she already knows, or take the form of a lead on a person, place, or event around which [[Crime-Unveiling Wickedness]] would lead to relevant information. If the [[Storyteller]] runs out of clues to give, the Abyssal’s player can propose theories on these topics for him to confirm or deny instead.
Even if the Abyssal fails, she still uncovers a single clue.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal can invoke her [[Whispers]] to uncover an additional clue on a successful roll. She can wait until after other clues have been revealed to do so.
