*The Abyssal’s violent endeavors have honed and hardened her fists.*
The Abyssal’s unarmed attacks can deal lethal damage, and she can parry attacks that deal lethal damage bare-handed. For one mote, an unarmed withering attack ignores (Essence) soak. If she has an Intimacy relevant to her motivation for fighting, she ignores (Essence + Intimacy) soak.
