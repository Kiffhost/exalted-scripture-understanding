*Comprehension, Quiet as the Grave, Unseen Wisp Method The Abyssal scours away every sign of her presence, leaving nothing to be perceived.*
The Abyssal chooses one of hearing, smell, touch, or taste and renders herself imperceptible to that sense.
If she stunts this Charm with a description of how she accomplishes this, its cost is reduced by two motes.
This Charm can be stacked twice to negate two different senses.
