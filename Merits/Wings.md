At three dots, this Merit grants the character patagia or other weak, gliding wings. The character has little ability to maneuver in the air, and cannot effectively gain height, but may cover enormous distances with a leap, especially from high elevation—effectively, she may travel two range bands forward when gliding before she must descend one range band down, and as long as she has room to glide to the ground, need not fear falling damage.
The five dot version of this Merit grants powerful wings (or equivalent means of flight, such as gas-filled bags) and true, functional flight. A flying character in combat moves no faster than other characters; her advantages are in her ability to pass over most forms of difficult terrain with ease, and in the severe trouble many close-ranged fighters experience in reaching her to attack her.
### Drawback
In addition to the stigma of mutation, the character suffers a -4 penalty to attempts to disguise herself as a non-winged individual. Actions taken in the air which require any degree of finesse or precision (including attacks in combat) suffer a -3 penalty; drawing a bow or swinging a [[spear]] without getting in the way of one’s own wings is more difficult than it looks!
