*Meditating on future combat, the Exalt speaks a design into her soul that erases her from combat’s flow.*
This Charm permanently upgrades [[Shadow Victor’s Repose]]. 
When the Exalt uses it to reroll [[Join Battle]], she also momentarily vanishes ([[Essence]]) rounds from the short term memories of all opponents, allowing her next unexpected attack to act as an ambush provided it occurs within that period.
