Sun’s Brush rewards those who have proven their wit and wisdom. Once per day, when the Solar succeeds on a roll to introduce or challenge a fact and rolls 5+ successes, she gains a point of temporary [[Willpower]]. In combat, she may exchange this reward for 5 [[Initiative]] as long as she isn’t in Crash.
