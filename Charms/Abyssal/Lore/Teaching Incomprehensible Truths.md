*Death’s Lawgiver opens her students’ minds to knowledge beyond the ken of the living, imparting the secret wisdom of the void.*
The Abyssal trains a student, letting him incur experience debt to purchase up to (Abyssal’s Intelligence) dots of relevant Attributes or Abilities. This can raise his trait ratings above the Abyssal’s own. For Quick Characters, this can raise dice pools up to fourteen dice and static values up to seven. The training time required is divided by (Abyssal’s Intelligence + 5), although the Abyssal needs only spend a single scene mentoring her student during this time.
For every three points of experience the Abyssal’s student spends or incurs as experience debt, she may weaken one of his Intimacies by one step if it opposes one of her Principles or negative Ties. He can’t voluntarily strengthen the eroded Intimacy until he suffers narratively meaningful consequences for acting against it.
A Lore 5, Essence 3 repurchase lets the Abyssal train up to (Essence) students with a single use of this Charm.
Not all students need take the same traits, although the Storyteller may require her to stunt appropriate instruction for training widely disparate subjects.
Alternatively, she can train up to (Essence x5) students but can only grant them (Intelligence/2, rounded up) dots each.
