Whenthewindofbattlereversesdirection,theTerrestrial adapts her strategy at a momentâ€™s notice. She rerolls (Essence) non-1 failed dice on a Strategic Maneuver roll. A War 5, Essence 5 repurchase allows the Dragon-Blood to spend one Willpower after rolling her maneuver, but before rerolling failures, to change her chosen stratagem.
