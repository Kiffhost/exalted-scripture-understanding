*The Lunar’s eye takes in fleeting details of movement and geometry that pass too quickly for most to notice, foreseeing the outcomes of complex interactions.*
Once an object or group of objects has been set in motion, the Lunar can perfectly predict the trajectory and outcome of that motion in the absence of outside intervention. This includes perfectly predicting the outcomes of coin tosses, dice rolls, roulette wheels, and the like. If a character cheats at such a game, the discrepancy in results alerts the Lunar to this tampering, although it does not let her discern how the cheating was accomplished or single out the individual responsible if there are multiple potential candidates.
The Lunar can also benefit from this Charm when she rolls opposing an environmental trap or hazard where her ability to predict the outcome of moving objects lets her find a place of safety, such as weathering a rockslide. She can oppose such hazards with ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]), adding ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice.
This Charm’s potential applications aren’t limited to those above. The Storyteller is encouraged to reward creative uses by providing mechanical advantages or revealing useful information.
