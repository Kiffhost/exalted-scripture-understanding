*Filling her lungs with thunder, the Lunar roars loud enough to shake the heavens.*
To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 10+. She makes a decisive attack with ({Charisma or Strength} + {Athletics, [[Performance]], or Presence}) against an enemy within long range, which can only be blocked or dodged with magic. An enemy hit by the attack is knocked back one range band, plus an additional range band for every three successes on the damage roll, to a maximum of long range from the Lunar, and lands prone. If an impact with a solid surface prevents her victim from being flung this full distance, he suffers falling damage (Exalted, p. 232) as though he’d fallen a number of range bands equal to the distance prevented by the impact. This damage is usually bashing, though some surfaces may inflict lethal damage. This attack can’t be enhanced with [[Dexterity]] [[Charms]]. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has a threaten or intimidate dice pool may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
