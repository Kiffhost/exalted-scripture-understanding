*Even if the Dragon-Blood cannot persuade another with her arguments, she can give him the clarity of air to know the truth for himself when he sees it.*
She rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) with double 9s to instill a single character with an [[Intimacy]] she possesses. Even if she doesn’t beat her target’s [[Resolve]] or he resists, her words linger with him for (6 − his [[Integrity]]) weeks thereafter. Every gust of wind seems to whisper her argument in endless repetition, while weather patterns take on symbolic or allegorical meaning to him. Each time the target learns new information that supports the Dragon-Blood’s argument and would allow her to retry her instill action (Exalted, p. 222), he makes a ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) instill roll against himself, adding (the Dragon-Blood’s [[Essence]]) in non-Charm bonus dice. He cannot choose to fail the roll, and the rules for lengthy debates apply (Exalted, p. 219). Successfully asserting his [[Resolve]] against such a roll ends this Charm’s effect. This Charm may only be used against any given character once per story.
