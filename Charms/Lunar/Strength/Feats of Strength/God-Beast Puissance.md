Aware of the presence of her every muscle and bone and how they must come together as she acts, the Lunar bends the world to her will. She adds a free full [[Strength]] Excellency to a feat of strength. Once per scene, if a successful feat of demolition enhanced with this Charm upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]], the Lunar gains one [[Willpower]].
