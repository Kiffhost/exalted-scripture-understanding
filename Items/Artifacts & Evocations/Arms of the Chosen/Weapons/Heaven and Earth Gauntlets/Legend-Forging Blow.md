Calling up limitless depths of power from the [[Heaven and Earth Gauntlets]], the wielder strikes an almighty blow to carve her name into legend. She may unleash one of the following effects: 
- She can knock back an enemy of up to Legendary [[Size]], like a tyrant lizard or a warstrider, with a decisive attack. A hit flings the enemy three range bands backwards; if flung into an obstacle, he may suffer falling damage (Exalted, p. 232) at the Storytellerâ€™s discretion. 
- The wielder can smash through heavy fortifications with a single punch, doubling her effective base [[Strength]] to determine if she may attempt a given feat of demolition (Exalted, p. 231). Success destroys the targeted object instantly, while failure indicates the wielder will need to spend at least a few minutes more to destroy it. 
- The wielder can use [[Legend-Forging Blow]] to stunt other applications of strength, such as diverting the course of a river by force or halting an avalanche in place with a single blow. The Storyteller should enhance these stunts with benefits comparable to the above options. [[Legend-Forging Blow]] can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a positive Defining Tie towards a community by defeating a powerful enemy that threatens it. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
