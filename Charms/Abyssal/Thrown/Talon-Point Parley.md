*The Abyssal’s arguments are all the more compelling to those who’ve witnessed her deadly prowess firsthand.*
When the Abyssal makes a [[bargain]], [[threaten]], [[persuade]], or [[read intentions]] roll roll against an enemy she’s hit with an attack this scene, he suffers −1 [[Resolve]] or [[Guile]] against it, or −2 if the attack was unexpected.
If it was an [[ambush]], she also adds a free full Excellency. She also gains this benefit.
If the deathknight’s roll succeeds, her target loses (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) [[Initiative]]. This happens even if he spends [[Willpower]] to resist.
With [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal gains the [[Initiative]] lost by her target.
