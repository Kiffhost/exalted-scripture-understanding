*After spending a turn aiming, a lightning ballistaâ€™s master may use this Evocation to make a single unblockable withering or decisive attack roll against all characters in a line out to long range, friend or foe.*
Withering attacks have a flat +3 [[Accuracy]] bonus. On a withering attack, the firing character makes a separate damage roll for each character hit by the attack, but cannot gain more than (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) [[Initiative]] from damage dealt to any one enemy. On a decisive attack, she divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among all enemies hit by the attack (round up) to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring [[Hardness]]. Battle groups take (her full [[Initiative]]) in damage, and do not count against the total [[Initiative]] she must distribute. After a scene in which this Evocation is used, the lightning ballista must receive maintenance before it can be fired again. This is a difficulty 3 roll for a character using [[Craft]] (First Age Artifice), or difficulty 6 for a character using [[Craft]] (Artifacts). A failed roll cannot be retried until a full day has passed.
