*Sealed compartments in the walls of these jugs, amphorae, casks, or trunks of blue jade contain supernatural sources of cold — typically sorcerously condensed freezing fog from the White Sea or unmelting ice from the uttermost Pole of Air.*
Master artisans carve hundreds of hair-fine lateral channels inside the jade, their occult patterns confining and circulating that supernatural cold.

A winterbreath jar chills and preserves perishable contents at a constant temperature a few degrees above freezing. Their size varies; an average one holds three gallons of liquid, or a large melon or haunch of meat. Some have a hearthstone socket; slotting in an air hearthstone reduces the contents’ temperature well below freezing. Winterbreath jars don’t require attunement.
