The Quincunx’s master releases a torrent of gathered power as an unblockable withering attack with (Wits + Occult) against all enemies within short range. The attack has raw damage equal to (her Intelligence + Essence + extra successes) and Overwhelming (Essence). An enemy that takes damage is knocked back one range band and falls prone; crashing an enemy knocks him back an additional range band. Creatures of darkness are especially vulnerable to this attack, and cannot apply their soak against the damage. The Quincunx’s wearer only gains Initiative from the highest damage roll against an enemy caught in the blast. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by banking 10+ sorcerous motes in the Quincunx on a single tick.
