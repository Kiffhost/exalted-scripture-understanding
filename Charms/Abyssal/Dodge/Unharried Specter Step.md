*The Abyssal drifts across the battlefield with the blasé indifference of one well accustomed with death.*
After the deathknight successfully disengages, if her enemy pursues her and she uses her reflexive movement, she can gain two Initiative if she uses her next movement action to enter close range with him.
Additionally, the Abyssal can spend one mote when she disengages to avoid losing Initiative.
