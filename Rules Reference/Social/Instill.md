This action is the main mechanism for [[Intimacy#Gaining Intimacies|gaining]] and [[Intimacy#Losing Intimacies|losing intimacies]].

The instill action is used to change the feelings and beliefs of others. When a player takes an instill action, he declares what he wants to make his target feel or believe. The Storyteller may apply [[Dice Rolls#Modifiers|penalties]] to the roll if this belief is particularly implausible or hard to accept, up to a maximum penalty of -5 for truly unbelievable claims. On a successful roll, the target forms an [[Intimacy]] towards that belief.

However, there are limits to what someone will believe when they already have strong opinions to the contrary. The character may need to lessen existing Intimacies before instilling new ones. While the instill action can always be used to create new Minor Intimacies, altering existing Intimacies is more difficult:
- Strengthening a Minor Intimacy, or weakening a Major Intimacy, can only be done if the target has a different Minor or better Intimacy that supports the attempted influence.
- Likewise, raising a Major Intimacy, or weakening a Defining Intimacy, is only possible if the target has a different Major or better Intimacy that supports the attempted influence.
- Strengthening an existing Intimacy requires that the evidence raised or argument made in favor of strengthening it be more compelling than whatever caused the Intimacy to arrive at its current intensity. For example, if a shopkeeper gained a Minor Intimacy of distrust toward the Guild after learning that they often undercut local merchants, he would need even stronger evidence in order to strengthen his Intimacy to Major. Perhaps he learns that a Guild merchant plans to buy out his shop, or speaks to a man who once partnered with a Guildsman and was betrayed and sold into slavery.

# Retry
If you fail an instill action, you must present your target with substantially greater evidence for whatever you are trying to convince him of before you can retry.

A Solar who wishes to make the people of a small farming village trust him might need to defend them from a predatory god or greedy Imperial tax collector before they will accept him. A strategist who fails to convince a general that a war with An-Teng would be a disaster would need to bring back intelligence reports that prove his point before he will be heard. A suitor trying to win a princeâ€™s affection would need to present a much grander display of love.
