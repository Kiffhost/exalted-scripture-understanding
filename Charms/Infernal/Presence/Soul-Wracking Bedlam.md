*The Infernal’s eyes shine with mad impossible colours as she speaks in feverish nonsense, overflowing with all-consuming passion.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must be inspired with an emotion. She babbles nonsensically or raves wildly, making an ({Appearance, Charisma, or Manipulation} + Presence) roll to inspire the same emotion in a single character. He must have a Major or Defining Intimacy based on that emotion, although the Infernal doesn’t need to be aware of it. If he’s already inspired with that emotion, only a Minor Intimacy is needed.

If the Infernal succeeds, her victim is overcome with maddening passion. The inspired emotion doesn’t end at the end of the scene — instead, it lasts indefinitely, counting as a Major Derangement for magic capable of removing such afflictions. As long as the inspired Derangement remains, the victim’s memories are distorted, causing him to remember every event in his life as if he had been inspired with the chosen passion during it.

A character can resist this effect by paying (Intimacy x 2) Willpower immediately after his Resolve is beaten by this influence. If he doesn’t, he can only be freed by removing the Derangement or with other magic that can break Psyche effects.
