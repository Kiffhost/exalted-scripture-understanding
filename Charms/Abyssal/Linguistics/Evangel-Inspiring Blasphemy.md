*The deathknight’s words are full of apocalyptic urgency, spreading her bleak gospel to all corners of the world.*
The Abyssal makes an influence roll to instill a negative Principle and drive her readers to share its message. If her influence succeeds against a target and he doesn’t resist with Willpower, the influence also counts as a successful persuade action, supported by the instilled Intimacy. This can be resisted with Willpower separately from the instill roll, but costs an additional Willpower to resist.
Affected characters will spread the Abyssal’s words.
The lengths they’ll go to depend on the instilled Intimacy’s intensity (Exalted, p. 216). They add (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) dice on instill rolls to spread the Principle or weaken Intimacies that oppose it.
This Charm’s effects linger for (Essence + {Charisma or Manipulation}) days after it ends. Once this period elapses, the Abyssal’s text no longer compels this evangelism. Affected characters are freed from her persuasion but lose the benefits it provides.
With Linguistics 5, Essence 3, even the unwilling spread the Abyssal’s message, as long as her influence failed by no more than (her Essence) successes. This also applies against those who spent Willpower to resist her instill roll. Each night, they recite the text in their sleep if they didn’t proselytize while awake.
They unconsciously make an instill roll against anyone there to hear them — including others who are asleep.
They may avoid speaking this by gagging themselves while sleeping or taking similar measures, but doing so prevents him from regaining Willpower from sleep.
This Psyche effect costs three Willpower to resist.
