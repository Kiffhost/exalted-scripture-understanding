Even those who peer into the sea know nothing of its hidden depths. The Dragon-Blood embodies this secrecy, wearing masks behind masks. When another character succeeds on a roll to pierce her disguise, she may conceal her features behind a swirling cloud of mist that spumes from her anima, perfectly obscuring her identity. The opposing character and other onlookers realize that she wasn’t who she was posing as, but don’t learn anything about who she actually is. The Dragon-Blood reverts back to her true appearance at the end of the scene, making a hasty retreat advisable.
