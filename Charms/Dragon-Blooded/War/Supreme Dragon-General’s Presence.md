The Dragon-Blood’s anima blazes across the battlefield as enemy armies break before her legion’s might, its glorious radiance calling retreating foes and deserters to fight beneath her banner. When an enemy battle group is routed, the Dragon-Blood may reset her rally for numbers action (Exalted, p. 210), as deserting enemy soldiers may potentially be won over to her cause. If she rallies for numbers on or before her next turn, she rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10 rolled.
In Fire Aura, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Aura to reflexively make a rally for numbers roll upon using this Charm.
Enemies won over to the Dragon-Blood’s side will fight for the duration of the scene, but don’t immediately gain any lasting loyalty — good treatment or social influence are necessary to secure their permanent allegiance.
This Charm can only be used once per scene.
