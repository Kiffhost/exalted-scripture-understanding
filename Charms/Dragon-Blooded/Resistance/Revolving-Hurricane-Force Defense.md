The Dragon-Blood’s incredible resilience is like a raging gale barely contained within her body, striking aside her enemies’ blows before they even touch her. She rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) with ([[Essence]]) non-Charm bonus dice, and gains a soak bonus equal to the successes against any attack by a character with lower [[Initiative]]. The soak bonus falls by one point each time an attack hits the Dragon-Blood. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
