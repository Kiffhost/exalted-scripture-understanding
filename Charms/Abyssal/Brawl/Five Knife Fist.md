*Jagged spikes of dark [[Essence]] burst from the Abyssal fingertips, rending through bone and steel.*
The Abyssal adds +([[Strength]]) Overwhelming on an unarmed withering attack. On a decisive unarmed attack, she instead doubles 10s on the damage roll and rolls an additional die of damage for each damage roll 10.
A repurchase of this Charm lets the Abyssal use it as a Simple Charm for five motes, one [[Willpower]], extending its duration to one scene. Alternatively, she can invoke this version reflexively for two motes, one [[Willpower]] after damaging an enemy with the Supplemental version of this Charm.
