*Through meditation, the Exalt sinks into the [[Essence]] of her environment, temporarily absolving herself of the Ties and Principles that make her transient and definite.*
Instead she is everything and nothing, a fulcrum for the flow of all [[Essence]]. In this state she is untouchable. She cannot be attacked or harmed in any way, though she can still be subject to social influence. Powerful beings such as demons whose very voices break hearts and shatter souls may converse with her without harming her; if a being intends her no harm, then even the voice of the apocalypse or the withering whisper of the [[Dowager of the Irreverent Vulgate in Unrent Veils|Dowager]] cannot harm her. Throughout her meditation, the Exalt simply becomes a natural facet of the cosmos, equal to and unaffected by all things. Her [[Lore]] score is doubled if for the purposes of discussing the nature of [[Essence]] and the movement of the stars. Her [[Occult]] score is doubled if for the purposes of making enlightened pronouncement on the mysteries of the universe. The powers and protections of this Charm end the moment the Solar ceases meditation. 

## Special activation rules
