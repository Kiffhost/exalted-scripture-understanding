*Hungry for the dreams and passions of the living, the Abyssal obsesses over those unfortunate enough to catch her interest.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a successful [[read intentions]] roll, gaining a Minor Tie of fascination toward her target if she doesn’t already have one. She can’t voluntarily erode this [[Intimacy]], and it can’t be weakened below Minor.
The Abyssal gains temporary specialties for that character in [[Awareness]], [[Larceny]], [[Presence]], [[Stealth]], and [[Socialize]]. If she acts against her [[Intimacy]], she loses these specialties, though she can regain them by upholding her [[Intimacy|Tie]].
