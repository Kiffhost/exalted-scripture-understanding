Gauging the bureaucratic merit of those around her, the Dragon-Blood distinguishes those who’ve risen to the top from the dregs. She can use Finding the Water’s Depths to assess a character’s bureaucratic standing, gaining a general sense of what kind of bureaucratic organizations, if any, he belongs to, as well as his approximate rank within those organizations. For example, using it on a Guild factor could reveal that he belongs to a mercantile enterprise and holds a high position, but wouldn’t provide the specifics of his membership in the Guild.
