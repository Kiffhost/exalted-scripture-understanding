*The Sidereal’s arrow draws the eye of her enemy, turning his attention where she wants it.*
The Sidereal makes a distract gambit, adding (Manipulation/2, rounded up) dice on the attack and Initiative rolls. If the gambit succeeds and the Initiative roll beats her enemy’s Resolve, the Sidereal’s arrow misdirects his attention to something he can perceive, priming him to focus on it.
An affected character must use his next turn to take an action that involves the object of his focus — attacking an enemy, using defend other to protect an ally, picking up a valuable necklace, etc. If it’s too far away for him to interact with, he must instead use his move action to approach. He can flurry this action with an unrelated one, but the flurry penalty on both rolls increases by two. Resisting this influence costs one Willpower and (Sidereal’s Essence, maximum 5) Initiative.
