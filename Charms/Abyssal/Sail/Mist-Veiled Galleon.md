*With a deathly exhalation, the Abyssal shrouds her ship in Underworldly fog.*
The Abyssal shrouds her ship in fog, which extends out to medium range from the ship. It inflicts a −3 penalty on vision-based Perception rolls and a −1 penalty on other actions that depend on vision, including attacks.
This subtracts successes instead of dice on rolls to identify or track the ship. This mist can’t be dispersed by mundane wind or weather, though magic is capable of doing so.
In naval combat, the mist inflicts a −3 penalty on rolls opposing the Abyssal’s concealment maneuvers (Exalted, p. 245). If the maneuver succeeds, she converts the bonus dice from it to non-Charm successes.
Additionally, enemy boarding actions against her ship increase their cost by +1 Momentum.
With a Sail 5 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm even while not aboard a ship, creating a cloud of mist that extends out to medium range. She may reflexively roll Stealth to establish concealment within the mist.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can use this Charm reflexively at the beginning of naval combat.
