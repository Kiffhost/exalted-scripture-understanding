*The Infernal sloughs off her mortality, scouring her immortal Essence free of its paltry chrysalis.*

The Infernal becomes an innately immaterial being, like gods and demons. She is dematerialized by default, following the same rules as [[Flesh-Scorning Flagellation]], including the ability to use its [[Flesh-Scorning Flagellation#Stone-Flayer Touch (Essence 4) (1m or 1m, 1wp)|Stone-Flayer Touch]] key.

The Infernal can use [[Flesh-Scorning Flagellation]] to materialize herself, reversing its grotesque transformation and restoring her material form. When used this way, its duration is extended to Indefinite.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has [[Dematerialized Form]] (p. XX), she gains +2 Evasion while in it and can perfectly dodge any attack that isn’t enhanced by magic. This doesn’t stack with [[Flesh-Scorning Flagellation]]’s Blasphemy effect.
