Warriors using Steel Devil style store [[Initiative]] in their offhand weapon. This stored [[Initiative]] is called Charge. Charge cannot be withered away, cannot be used for decisive attacks without specific [[Charms]], and is used to create a damage bonus on certain [[Charms]]. In order to increase her Charge, the Exalt must do successful withering damage. She may then reflexively move up to ([[Essence]] or two, whichever is greater) [[Initiative]] to her Offhand Charge. This is the secret of Steel Devil style. The Exalt cannot store more than ([[Dexterity]] + [[Essence]]) Charge unless stated otherwise in a Charmâ€™s text.
