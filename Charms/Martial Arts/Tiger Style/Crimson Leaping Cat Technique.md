*Moving with the speed and agility of a leaping tiger, the martial artist closes the distance to her prey.*
Crimson Leaping Cat Technique steals a point of Initiative from an enemy upon successfully rushing him. If the martial artist makes an attack against that enemy before the end of the next round, any extra successes on the rush are added as bonus dice to her attack roll.
