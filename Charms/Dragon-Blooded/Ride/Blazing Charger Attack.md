*The Dragon-Blood builds her killing pace as she charges across the battlefield, urging her mount onwards faster and faster.*
She doubles 9s on a mounted rush. On a success, if her enemy provokes her reflexive movement, she may move up to two range bands towards him instead of one. If she reaches close range, she may also make a reflexive decisive attack using [[Brawl]], [[Martial Arts]], or [[Melee]]. If she attacks with a fixed [[lance]], she may make an impaling attack (Exalted, p. 203) without needing to meet the normal requirements.
