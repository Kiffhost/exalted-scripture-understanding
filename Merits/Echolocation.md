### Prerequisite
[[Enhanced Sense]] (Hearing) The mutant can “see” out to short range using hearing, ignoring penalties or increased difficulties due to blindness, darkness, poor visibility, etc. She can’t discern color or fine detail, and solid obstructions like walls block echolocation.
An alternative version of this mutation only functions while submerged in water but extends to medium range.
