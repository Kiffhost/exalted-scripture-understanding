*Inhuman Perfection of (Sense) x2 The deathknight knows all within her dread domain, watching from every shadow.*
The Abyssal extends her senses throughout a stronghold she’s claimed for herself — an attuned manse, her Stygian manor, a fortress occupied by her army. She gains the following benefits
- She can perceive everywhere within the structure at once, unimpeded by its walls or similar obstructions. She must still make Awareness rolls as usual to focus on details, adding (Essence) non-Charm successes on such rolls.
- For particularly dramatic and noticeable things — a bonfire anima, a warstrider on the march, a bellowing tyrant lizard — the Abyssal can perceive them as long as they’re within (Essence) miles of her lair or (Essence x5) miles while using the applicable Inhuman Perfection of (Sense).
- Enemies within range of the Abyssal’s senses can’t make unexpected attacks against her, even if she failed to beat their Stealth roll.
- Ghost Sentinel Technique’s range is extended to encompass the entirety of her lair. If she has the Far-Ranging Upgrade, they can travel up to (Essence) miles from it.
This Charm ends if the Abyssal leaves her stronghold.
With Essence 4, the Abyssal can use this Charm in shadowlands or the Underworld without needing control over them. This extends her senses out to one mile, treating that area as her citadel, but her perception can’t cross a shadowland’s boundaries into Creation.
