*Corrupt gods and truculent spirits must bow their faces into the earth until they have learned humility.*
After crashing a spirit with a withering attack, the Immaculate may use this Charm. The spirit instantly materializes at no cost if dematerialized, and cannot dematerialize or use the Hurry Home Charm until (Immaculateâ€™s [[Strength]]) rounds have passed after it recovers from crash.
