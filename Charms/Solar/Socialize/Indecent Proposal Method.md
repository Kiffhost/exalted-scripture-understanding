*The silver-tongued charisma of the [[Solar Exalted]] allows them to say things others would normally suffer to speak.*
This Charm supplements an instill, persuade, or bargain action. It does not aid the Solarâ€™s persuasion in gaining acceptance, but it does guarantee that her offer will sound delightful, charming, or at least a necessary evil coming from her lips. This prevents any [[Intimacy]] toward her from being decreased as a result of her persuasion. This Charm affects everyone who witnesses the social action, even if they were not the targets. Characters must pay a point of temporary [[Willpower]] in order to take offense.
