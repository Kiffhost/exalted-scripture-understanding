The Dragon-Blood draws from her bond with a familiar to emulate its nature, her Aspect markings transforming into a more bestial appearance. To use this Charm, she must touch one of her familiars. She gains (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dots of mutations that reflect that familiar’s physical form, behavior, or traits. Once she has chosen a set of mutations that a familiar grants her, all subsequent uses of this Charm drawing from that same familiar will grant her the same mutations. She may choose a new set of mutations for her familiars upon increasing her [[Essence]]. This Charm is Wood Aspected when used on an animal familiar; when used on an elemental familiar acquired through [[Elemental Bond Meditation]] or the like, its aspect is the same as the elemental’s.
