*The Infernal can’t abide those who fail to show her proper respect, forcing them to kiss the ground if they will not do so of their own accord.*

Enemies and bystanders within long range of the Infernal who can see her must immediately prostrate themselves before her unless they pay one Willpower to resist. Trivial characters can’t resist. Affected characters fall prone and can’t attempt to rise unless they pay one Willpower.

When the Infernal makes an instill, persuade, or threaten roll against a prone character, he suffers −2 Resolve against it. This isn’t limited to those who bow before her.
## [[Keys]]
#### The Weight of Glory (Presence 5, Essence 3) (+1m, 1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, characters must also spend five Initiative to resist this Charm’s influence. Enemies who don’t resist immediately gain a Minor Tie of terrified awe to the Infernal.
