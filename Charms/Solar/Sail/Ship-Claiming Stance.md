The Essence of a ship knows its master. This Charm claims a ship. If it was not owned by one of the Exalted, the ship disregards its former master. Those who do not bear the Exalt’s remit suffer a -1 penalty to all actions taken on the Solar’s ship until she has formally welcomed them aboard. The Exalt may renounce her welcome at any time, restoring this penalty at her pleasure. In addition, if the Lawgiver’s positive intimacy toward the ship achieves Major or Defining status, the Exalt may draw up to five motes from her bond with the ship, once per day, but she must be shipboard to do so. Drawing motes from more than one ship or familiar in a day causes all motes past five to dissipate at the end of the round.
