The Sidereal exhales a puff of wind that untangles the thread of a ship’s fate from the weave of sky and sea. The Sidereal blesses a ship, adding (her [[Essence]]) dice on any character’s rolls to navigate naval hazards, enact [[Positioning]] or [[Escape]] stratagems, or otherwise maneuver it. The ship’s Speed isn’t penalized by bad weather, opposing wind or currents, or the like, and its crew is immune to environmental penalties. It won’t take on any water no matter how badly damaged it may be, though this won’t help with any it’s already taken on.
