*The Infernal dissolves away like eroded stone, becoming a gust of crimson-hued wind that coalesces into a human-like shape as she bestows the mercy of a swift death.*

The Infernal makes decisive attacks against a single enemy whose Initiative is lower than hers until she misses, to a maximum of (Initiative/3, rounded up) attacks. She suffers a −1 penalty on the second attack, which increases by one for each subsequent attack. She doesn’t roll damage until after all attack rolls are completed. Each attack has a base damage of (higher of Essence or 3), and the Infernal divides her Initiative evenly among all attacks that hit. Afterwards, she resets to base Initiative. If the Infernal uses any non-Excellency Melee Charms to enhance her attacks, she need only pay their cost once to benefit all of them.

The Infernal’s wind-like form makes it impossible to identify her, a distortion that lingers until the end of the scene after she uses this Charm. The transformation doesn’t render her immune to clashes or counterattacks; their disruptions to her wind-body leave wounds when she reforms.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating an enemy after making at least three decisive attacks against him on the same tick. If the Infernal incapacitates a foe before she has the chance to make all three attacks, she still resets this Charm.
