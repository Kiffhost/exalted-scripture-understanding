*The return of the Solars is a miracle never before seen.*
The universe inclines to hear their voices once again. When this Charm supplements a [[Performance]] action of any length, characters are inclined to stop and listen. This does not guarantee that the Lawgiver is persuasive in her arguments, but it does guarantee that her audience listens respectfully to her entire performance. Characters may pay one [[Willpower]] to leave the performance, but if they wish to interrupt or attack the Lawgiver, they must pay two [[Willpower]], and may only approach her by blending into her demonstration, capping the actions of each affected character by their individual ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) ratings until one of them is able to successfully stop her act. This Charm does not function after combat has started, but if activated beforehand, it remains active after [[Join Battle]] has been rolled, up until the Solar is forced to stop her performance.
