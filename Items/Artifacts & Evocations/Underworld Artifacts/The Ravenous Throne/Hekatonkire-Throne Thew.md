*Disliking the taste of its prey, the Ravenous Throne casts him away.*
[[The Ravenous Throne]] both restrains and throws a grappled enemy. Alternatively, it can drag its foe rather than restraining him. The throw must be decisive, and ignores the limit on how many rounds of control it can add to its damage roll. As long as the throw deals any damage, the victim is hurled to short range and knocked prone, suffering additional damage as per a fall of the same distance (Exalted, p. 232). If the throw attack has 10+ dice of damage, the throne can fling the victim to medium range.
## Resonant
With 20+ damage dice, an enemy can be thrown to long range.
