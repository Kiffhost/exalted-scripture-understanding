With a deft hand on the reins, the Dragon-Blood urges her steed skywards. She can ride horizontally over thin air for as long as her mount continues to move, allowing her to horizontally cross over canyons and similar gulfs. In addition, she may pay an additional point of Willpower when she uses Heaven-Gracing Leap to rush an aerial enemy at out to medium range. If successful, she’ll automatically ride one vertical or horizontal range band towards her target on the rushed character’s next two turns, in addition to her normal movement. If the Dragon-Blood ceases movement, ends this Charm early, or is unhorsed, both she and her steed drift to the ground without taking falling damage.
