The Lunar bears secret wisdom of Heaven and Hell, knowinghowbesttoappeasetheirotherworldlydenizens. She rolls (Intelligence + [Lore or Occult]) to introduce a fact regarding the location of something that will make an especially pleasing offering to a specific spirit or fae. The difficulty is (the entity’s Essence + 2), although the Storyteller may lower this for offerings requiring notable effort to recover. The offering must be specific and unique — the Lunar couldn’t introduce the fact that an entity desires apples, but could declare that the first apple of spring that grows on a specific tree would be efficacious. Once the Lunar has introduced this fact, the offering must still be secured. It counts as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) on a bargain roll with that entity, and also counts as a Major Intimacy supporting that influence. The offering’s benefit only applies to a single roll. With Essence 2, if the Lunar or her Solar mate conveys the offering, it counts as a Defining Intimacy, and increases the cost to resist by one Willpower.
