*The Infernal strikes at the air with a weapon. It fades into the wind, existing only as a vague potential for violence.*

The Infernal disperses a weapons into wind, as if it’d been banished Elsewhere. She may pay one mote to call it back to hand for a single tick, flickering with bloody lightning. Because of this, the weapon can’t be disarmed except in the tick that the Infernal uses it.

The Infernal can manifest up to (higher of Essence or 3) weapons. All she need do is take a miscellaneous action to strike the air, and the weapon vanishes, without needing a separate use of this Charm.

When this Charm ends, the banished weapons reform. The Infernal can reflexively ready as many as she has free hands to wield.

With Essence 4, the Infernal can manifest banished weapons for free.
