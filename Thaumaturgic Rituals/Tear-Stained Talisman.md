# Tear-Stained Talisman
Cause a willing (or bound) ghost to inhabit a talisman, even if they lack the Charms to do so. Talismans are specific to the ritual, granting minor magical benefits, Specialties based on the ghost’s expertise, and so on. Other rituals might pierce a corpse’s eye to see through it at a distance as per a familiar until it rots, conjure the ghost of a family member for a brief and enigmatic conversation, or enchant an effigy to be supernaturally alluring or repulsive to a particular ghost.
