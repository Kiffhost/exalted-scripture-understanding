*The Lawgiver draws down the [[Essence]] of battle and manifests it through the medium of her instrument.*
While playing this song in combat, the Solar and her allies each automatically gain one [[Initiative]] per round, and their successful withering attacks each award an additional point of bonus [[Initiative]]. Allied battle groups who can hear the Solar’s music enjoy (Solar’s [[Essence]]) bonus dice to their attacks. While using this Charm, the Solar can’t take any non-Reflexive actions. This song does not stack with itself when played by more than one ally. Under the effects of [[Soul Voice]], allies automatically gain two [[Initiative]] per round, and battle groups gain (Solar’s [[Essence]]) automatic successes to their attacks.
