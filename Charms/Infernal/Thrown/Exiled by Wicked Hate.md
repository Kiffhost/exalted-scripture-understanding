*The Infernal is not so merciful as to grant her enemies the sweet release of death.*

The Infernal makes a gambit to banish an enemy into a darkness beyond existence. The gambit’s difficulty is (target’s Essence + 2). If she succeeds, her target vanishes for (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) rounds, plus an additional round for each extra success on the gambit’s Initiative roll. Once this Charm’s duration ends, the target reappears wherever he last was. He gains a Minor Principle representing a fear of the dark unless he pays one Willpower.

While banished, the target loses (Infernal’s Essence/2, rounded up) Initiative and motes at the start of each of his turns. He can use his turn to make a difficulty 6 (Wits + {Integrity, Occult, or Survival}) roll, reappearing immediately if he succeeds, though he still gains a fear of the dark. This action can’t be flurried. Banished characters can take other actions, though there’s nothing to interact within in the void.

Mortals and First Circle demons who are crashed while banished never return. From time to time, the Infernal dreams of their agony.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset when an enemy reappears after this Charm’s full duration has elapsed.
## [[Keys]]
#### Endless Pain Oubliette (Essence 5)
The Infernal can pay a five-mote surcharge to use this Charm against an enemy reflexively when she crashes him, empties his mote pool with [[Life-Blighting Emptiness Attack]], or leaves him with no temporary Willpower using [[Despair-Choked Spirit Maiming]].
