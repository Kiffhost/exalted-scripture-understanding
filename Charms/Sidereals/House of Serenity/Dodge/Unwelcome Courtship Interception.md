*The Sidereal evades the loss of a friend or ally by taking his wounds in his stead.*
When an enemy attacks an ally the Sidereal is protecting with Trouble Reduction Strategy, the Sidereal negates Evasion penalties against him. This doesn’t include penalties from surprise attacks. If he beats her Evasion, he must direct the attack against her, rather than her ward.
If the Sidereal knows Duck Fate, this Charm lets her protect her ward from undodgeable attacks.
## Special activation rules
If the attacker has a positive Tie or romantic intentions toward the Sidereal’s ward, successfully dodging lets her reflexively use SuitorDeflecting Sidestep on her ward’s behalf, waiving its Willpower cost. If successful, the attacker’s attentions are redirected to the Sidereal.
