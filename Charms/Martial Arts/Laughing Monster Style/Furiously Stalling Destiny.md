Violence begets violence as the stylist turns every attack back against her foes, mocking their hostility. She gains +1 Evasion. Her first attack against her attacker on or before her next turn adds one die of post-soak damage if withering, or one die of damage if decisive. If she makes a gambit, she adds an automatic success on the attack and Initiative rolls instead. The damage bonuses from multiple uses of this Charm against the same enemy stack; they’re lost if the stylist attacks a different enemy. 
## Mastery

The stylist can use this Charm after an attack is rolled. 
## Terrestrial

The stylist can’t stack this Charm’s benefits more than (Essence) times.
