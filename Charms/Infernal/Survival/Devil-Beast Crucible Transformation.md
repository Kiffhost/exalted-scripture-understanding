*Stoking the malevolence within a beast’s heart, the Infernal wakes it to the depths of its own wrath.*

The Infernal doubles 9s on a roll to train an animal (Exalted, p. 554), shortening the interval to one week, and waiving the usual specialty requirements. She doubles 8s for animals native to desolate, inhospitable environments. Animals trained this way are changed, taking on a demonic appearance and gaining a Minor Principle reflecting an aberrant behaviour, like an herbivore developing a taste for flesh or a bird obsessively singing the music of Hell. This Intimacy can’t be weakened below Minor intensity.

With Survival 5, Essence 3, the Infernal can train a familiar that she’s enhanced with [[Brazen Hellhound Bond]] to teach it a magical ability for two experience points. She can teach spirit Charms to demon familiars in the same way. This takes (Charm’s Essence minimum) days and doesn’t require a roll.
