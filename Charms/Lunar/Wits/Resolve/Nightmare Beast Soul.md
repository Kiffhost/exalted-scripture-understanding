The Lunar’s spirit shape dwells in the wilderness of her dreams, a living nightmare that hunts intruders. She gains +2 non-Charm [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]] against effects that target her while she’s sleeping. When a character enters the Lunar’s dreams with magic such as [[Silent Words of Dreams and Nightmares]] (Exalted, p. 475), she may pay one [[Willpower]] to manifest her spirit shape as a divine nightmare. She and the intruder make opposed [[Willpower]] rolls, with the Lunar doubling 9s. If she succeeds, her spirit shape’s manifestation destroys the intruder, negating the dream-entering magic’s effect. The intruder loses [[Willpower]] equal to the 1s on his roll. If he doesn’t have that much [[Willpower]], he suffers the difference in unpreventable levels of lethal damage.
