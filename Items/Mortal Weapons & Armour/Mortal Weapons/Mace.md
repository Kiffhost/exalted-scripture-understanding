A mace is nothing more than a heavy weight on the end of a handle. Hammers are better balanced but lighter. Both weapons deliver crushing, stunning blows to targets. In the world of Exalted, the heads of maces and hammers are often elaborately decorated. Some are sculpted into the shape of animal heads, while others have been cut so that, whatever angle theyâ€™re viewed from, they depict a symbol important to the wielder. Large or bulky improvised weapons like tables or chairs are treated as a mace or hammer, but with the improvised tag.
