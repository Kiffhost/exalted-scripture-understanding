The Lawgiver dances in and out of the whirling blades of her enemies like one consigned to death. For one mote, she retains the two Initiative that are lost with each disengage attempt. In addition, upon using a disengage action to move away on her opponent’s turn, if she then chooses to move to close range of her opponent as her next movement, she gains two Initiative automatically, regardless of whether she spent a mote on this Charm’s cost.
