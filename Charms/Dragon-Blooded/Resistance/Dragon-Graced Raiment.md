The Dragon-Blood adorns herself with the elements themselves, donning armor whose plates are frozen lightning, elegant many-layered dresses woven from varicolored flame, and hauberks resplendent with fragrant blossoms. When she recalls armor banished with [[Elemental Aegis]], she can don it in (mobility penalty + 1) rounds, and it is wreathed in the element she summons it from (or her Aspect element, if she recalls it by spending anima) for one scene.
She can also use [[Elemental Aegis]] to create any type of mundane armor out of the elements, donning it as above, or to create clothing from the elements that provides no defense benefits but counts as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for social rolls where the Exalt’s garb is relevant. Created armor or clothing normally lasts until the scene ends, but the Dragon-Blood can commit four motes after that to maintain it indefinitely.
Regardless of the option the Dragon-Blood employs, she gains benefits based on the invoked element: 
### Air
Air-wreathed armor is nigh weightless, gaining the Buoyant and Silent tags (Exalted, 593). Additionally, its mobility penalty is reduced by one when applied to the Dragon-Blood’s Evasion. Light armor or clothing instead adds an automatic success on [[Stealth]] rolls where moving silently is a factor.

### Earth
Earth-wreathed armor gains +1 soak. This increases to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) soak against smash attacks and other attacks that would forcibly move the Dragon-Blood. [[Artifact]] armor gains +1 [[Hardness]] against such attacks, while mundane armor provides [[Hardness]] 4 against them. Earth-wreathed clothing doesn’t provide a soak bonus or [[Hardness]] against normal attacks and doesn’t count as armor for purposes of [[Martial Arts]] and other incompatible effects, but it does provide soak and [[Hardness]] against smash attacks and the like.

### Fire
Fire-wreathed armor or clothing deals one die of lethal decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]], to any enemy who hits the Dragon-Blood with an unarmed or natural attack, or who spends a round physically grappling her. Her flaming raiment also adds an automatic success on [[Appearance]]-based threaten rolls.

### Water
Water-wreathed armor is slick and easily hidden, gaining the Concealable tag (Exalted, p. 593) and adding an automatic success on rolls to oppose being grappled, escape physical restraints, or move through tight spaces. Armor that already has the Concealable tag adds an automatic success on disguise rolls, as does water-wreathed clothing.

### Wood
Wood-wreathed armor or clothing is adorned with vibrant flowers with fragrant aromas, adding an automatic success on inspire rolls, instill rolls to create Ties of attraction or lust toward the Dragon-Blood, and persuade or bargain rolls to seduce characters.
