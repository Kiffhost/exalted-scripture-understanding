*Snapping the reins and drawing her mount back from an attack, the Lawgiver salvages her companionâ€™s precious life.*
A withering attack that would have crashed her mount instead leaves it with 1 Initiative. A decisive attack that would have slain her mount leaves it with a single health level. This Charm cannot be used to stop a withering attack if the mount already sits at 1 [[Initiative]], nor can it save the steed from a decisive attack if the steed has only one health level left.
