*The Infernal’s monstrous ferocity grasps and rends all who come within reach.*

The Infernal rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on the attack roll for a grapple gambit. If she succeeds on the gambit’s attack roll with 3+ extra successes, she also gains this bonus on the Initiative and control rolls. She always receives this benefit against enemies that are smaller than her.
### Keys
#### Lunging Monster Speed (Brawl 4, Essence 2)
The Infernal can use this Charm after an attack roll, but before the damage roll.
#### God-Strangling Attitude (Brawl 5, Essence 2) (+3m)
For a three-mote surcharge, the Infernal doubles extra successes on the grapple control roll.
#### Behemoth-Wrestling Fury (Brawl 5, Essence 3, [[#God-Strangling Attitude (Brawl 5, Essence 2) (+3m)|God-Strangling Attitude]])
The Infernal rerolls 5s as well. She can grapple enemies with Legendary Size.
#### Effortless Domination Hold (Brawl 5, Essence 3, [[#God-Strangling Attitude (Brawl 5, Essence 2) (+3m)|God-Strangling Attitude]])
The Infernal no longer needs to roll any extra successes to gain this Charm’s enhanced benefit.
