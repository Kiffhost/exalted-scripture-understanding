*The Infernal captains a ship of brigands and scoundrels, carousing and cavorting alongside her crew of the damned.*

When the Infernal joins with her ship’s crew in a meal, game, or other form of recreation or entertainment while aboard ship or on brief shore leave, she adds (Sail) non-Charm dice on influence rolls and read intentions roll against them.

Spending a scene carousing with crewmates who are mortals, Demon-Blooded, or First Circle demons causes them to gain both a Minor Tie of loyalty to the Infernal and a Minor Principle based on prioritizing their desires for power, wealth, or worldly pleasures above the needs of others or the dictates of law. They also gain one Willpower each, maximum once per day.

With Sail 5, Essence 2, the Infernal can also gain Willpower from a scene of carousing by forming or strengthening a Principle like the one her crew gains.
