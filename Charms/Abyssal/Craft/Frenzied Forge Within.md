*The Abyssal works like a woman possessed, shaping molten iron with her bare hands and forging masterpieces in a single, sleepless night.*
The Abyssal undertakes a [[Basic Project|basic]] or [[major project]] without needing tools or a workshop, and completes it with incredible speed. Most can be finished in seconds or minutes if she has all the necessary materials.
The most arduous, work-intensive projects can be completed in an hour if basic or a day if major.
With a [[Craft]] 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a four-mote, one [[Willpower]] surcharge to use this Charm on a [[Superior Project|superior]] or [[legendary project]]. Such uses aren’t [[Mute]]. Such projects are typically completed within (6 – [[Essence]]) weeks, though five-dot artifacts and N/A artifacts take that many months instead. [[Manse|Manses]] instead divide the time necessary to complete them by ([[Essence]], minimum 2), rounded up.
