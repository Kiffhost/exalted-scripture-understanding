Even the mightiest beasts learn to bow before the dragon. The Dragon-Blood rolls ([Attribute] + Ride) against an animal’s Resolve, impressing or subduing it with a stunt over the course of a few minutes of interaction. She might win a tiger’s respect by staring it down using Charisma, wrestle a river dragon using Strength to secure a place on its back, or leap out of a tree to land on a strix using Dexterity. On a success, the animal allows the Dragon-Blood to saddle and mount it, forming a Minor Tie of loyalty to her. A single use of this Charm is insufficient to completely tame a wild animal, but it begins the process. Kindly treatment, roleplaying interactions, and magic such as Beast-Taming Aspect (p. 271) over the course of one or more sessions can tame even the most feral beast, at the Storyteller’s discretion.
