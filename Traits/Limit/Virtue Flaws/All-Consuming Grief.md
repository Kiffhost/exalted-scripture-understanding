The Solar is overwhelmed by regret or sorrow, and can do nothing but stop to mourn what he has lost or to brood upon the injustices that have befallen him. He’ll try to go off to be alone to grieve, if possible; if not, then the Solar ignores his surroundings and focuses inward on his pain. He stirs from his grief for nothing, not even to help his allies.
[[All-Consuming Grief]] can be ended prematurely if the Solar is attacked or if someone to whom he has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] is incapacitated.
