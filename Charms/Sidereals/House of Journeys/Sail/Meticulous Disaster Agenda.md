*The Sidereal trades safety for expedience, beckoning one of the many troubles listed in the Division of Journeys’ records of peril to win Mercury’s favor for her ship by overcoming it.*
While traveling aboard a ship, the Sidereal foretells a disaster it will face if it continues on its course. Her player chooses the general nature of the danger — “a storm”, “Fair Folk,” “privateers,” etc. The Storyteller determines the specifics so that it can pose a significant challenge to her and her Circle and other allies. The threat can’t come from aboard the ship, ruling out mutiny and the like. If the Storyteller thinks imminent peril suits the current story, the disaster occurs before the next sunrise or sunset; otherwise, it occurs as soon as dramatically appropriate. Either way, the Sidereal predicts the time of its occurrence with sufficient accuracy for those aboard ship to prepare for it if they heed her. If the Sidereal and her companions overcome the challenge, a sudden gale of golden wind propels her ship forward with tremendous force, sending it far enough along its course that the time needed to complete the remainder of the journey is divided by ([[Essence]]), though never sooner than the next sunrise or sunset. If the ship’s captain heeded her warning, he gains −1 target number on unopposed [[Sail]] rolls for the rest of the journey.
