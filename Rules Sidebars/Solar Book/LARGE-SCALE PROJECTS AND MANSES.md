Large-scale undertakings such as merchant ships or palaces are undertaken as superior projects. Unlike artifacts, they only require a proper [[Craft]] Ability (such as architecture) and sufficient materials (including, for most such projects, significant funds and manpower) to attempt. Starting a large-scale project requires a superior craft slot costing two major slots and two gold points, and attempting to finish it follows the same rules as trying to complete an [[Artifact]] 2 superior project, save that the Storyteller dictates an appropriate amount of time spent working on the project before an attempt to finish can be attempted, and the project has no terminus. 

[[Manse]] construction follows the same rules as artifact construction with the following exceptions: [[Craft]] (Geomancy) replaces [[Craft]] (Artifacts) for all requirements (Geomancy works much like Artifacts, save that Architecture is the only relevant [[Craft]] that Geomancy can derive from), a threedot manse requires at least a year of construction while a five-dot manse requires at least two years, and a three-dot manse has a goal number of 50 while a five-dot manse has a goal number of 100. Under incredibly rare circumstances, a Solar might attempt to raise an N/A-rated manse atop an N/A-rated demesne, harnessing the raw energies of Creation to fuel unique feats of architectural power. This follows all of the same rules as completing a legendary project, save that it requires [[Craft]] (Geomancy) rather than [[Craft]] (Artifacts).
