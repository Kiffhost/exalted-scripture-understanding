In the [[First Age]], the Lunars forged soul-deep bonds between themselves and the Solars. Not all Lunars have Solar mates (and vice versa), but for those who do, the experience of meeting one is unmistakable — the Lunar instantly recognizes him as her bonded mate, and forms a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward him with an emotional context chosen by her player, if she doesn’t have one already. 

Lunars’ feelings for their Solar mates run the gamut of human emotions, both positive and negative, but they’re all passionately felt. If a Lunar’s [[Intimacy|Tie]] for her Solar mate is ever fully eroded, she forms a new Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward him with a player-chosen context at the scene’s end. A player who wants to guarantee her Solar mate will be a prominent and positive figure in her Lunar’s life should take the [[Allies]] Merit (p. XX). Otherwise, his appearances and role are up to the Storyteller — they can be friends, rivals, enemies, lovers, and more. 

If a Lunar’s Solar mate dies, he still counts as her mate until she meets his next incarnation. In the [[Time of Tumult]], some Lunars have discovered their mates reincarnated as Abyssals or Infernals. This doesn’t change the bond’s effects, though it often complicates the Lunar’s relationship with her reborn mate.

## Abyssal/Infernal mates
Charms that refer to a Lunar’s Solar mate also include Abyssal or Infernal mates. 

## Solars and the Bond
Most Solars that encounter their Lunar mates experience a similar recognition and emotional connection, using the same rules as Lunars. That not all Solars do is a testament to the Lunar’s greater capacity to change their nature. The same is true for Abyssals and Infernals, although they have a tendency toward negative Ties on first meeting their mates. A player may always opt not to reciprocate the bond if her Lunar mate is a Storyteller character. If she’s a player character, the two players should discuss whether they’re interested in a narrative of unreciprocated feelings beforehand.
