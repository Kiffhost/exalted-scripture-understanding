*Sensing the seismic forces that move beneath Creation and aligning her martial prowess with them, the Dragon-Blood unleashes devastating force upon a foe, sending him flying like a meteor crashing down to earth.*
She makes either a decisive smash attack against a crashed enemy or a decisive throw against a clinched foe. Success allows her to both fling her foe one range band back and knock him prone, shattering the ground where he lands to create difficult terrain and/or smash through destructible scenery. If she deals 3+ levels of decisive damage, she may hurl her victim to medium range, causing him to take damage as though from a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232). With 7+ levels of damage, she may fling him to long range, causing him to take damage as though from a medium-range fall.
