*The Infernal is a heritor to the makers of the world. If she aspires to equal them, it is not hubris — it is her right.*

The Infernal adds the following “advanced” objective to the basic objectives for gaining craft points (Exalted, p. 240). Each advanced objective she achieves grants an additional two silver points for a basic project or one gold point for others.
- If another character gains or strengthens a Tie toward her, she gains extra points if it’s a Tie of terrified awe, reverence, or the like, or if that character is either a demon or a worshipper of a demon, Yozi, or the Infernal.
- If the project provides a benefit to her, she gains extra points if that advantage aids her in righting a perceived wrong.
- If the project supports one of her Intimacies, she gains extra points it’s a negative Intimacy or a Principle that expresses the Infernal’s vision of how the world should be.

This Charm is compatible with effects like [[Demon-Smith’s Labors]] that let non-Craft actions trigger project awards.
