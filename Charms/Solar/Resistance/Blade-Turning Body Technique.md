*Through rigorous training and the fortifying might of her [[Essence]], the Solar learns to harden her skin until it can resist blade and flame alike as well as a suit of fine armor.*
While this Charm is active, the Solar is immune to incidental injury such as being cut by glass when crashing through a window, or bloodying her knuckles on a foreâ€™s jaw. She can ignore outright any environmental damage that would burn or lacerate her body of 3L or lower intensity, though she remains fully vulnerable to more insidious forms of damage such as freezing cold or deadly fumes. The Solar gains 8 soak against withering attacks while this Charm is active, along with 5 hardness. [[Blade-Turning Body Technique]] is incompatible with both armor and with [[Diamond-Body Prana]].
### On [[Blade-Turning Body Technique]]
The backer wanted a defensive soak option for his shirtless (his word) Solar, but without the variability of [[Diamond-Body Prana]]. The resulting Charm is Apocryphal because it uses the design logic of Solar armor-creating [[Charms]]. It averages out the soak-granting result of [[Diamond-Body Prana]], but loses a bit of power in its incidental resistances to compensate for its reliability, along with the possibility of being further strengthened by [[Martial Arts]] [[Charms]].
