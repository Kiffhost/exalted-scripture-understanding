*The Immaculate channels a surge of Essence through her strike, causing every moving fluid in her foe’s body to reverse its course.*
She makes a decisive attack. On a hit, her victim rolls (Stamina + Resistance) against a difficulty equal to her attack roll threshold successes. If he fails, each success he failed by adds one die of decisive damage, and after taking the decisive damage he suffers withering damage equal to his current wound penalty, which is added to the Immaculate’s base Initiative. This attack twists and disrupts the Essence of spirits, causing their wound penalty to subtract successes rather than dice from their (Stamina + Resistance) roll. 
## Reset
This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy whose Initiative was higher than the Immaculate’s.
