Casting a handful of salt into a body of water — even if it’s only a puddle — the Sidereal opens a vortex leading to a secret sea, its winds bearing flower petals and butterflies. The Sidereal leads a ship or other vessel capable of traversing sea or sky into the secret sea. While it’s separate from Creation, location and movement within it correlates to Creation, letting a journey through it lead to a distant destination. The ship can travel over what would be dry land and always enjoys Speed bonuses from currents and wind, but it’s impossible to perceive Creation from the ship or deliberately navigate toward a destination; instead, the ship’s journey ends at a destination that will prove beneficial to the Sidereal or her Circle’s goals or to someone she wishes to help. If possible, based on the distance traveled, this will be a body of water that’s safe and unobserved. Alternatively, she and her Circle may swim through the sea, twice as fast as normal. It’s possible to observe the ship’s movement from Creation as a slight shimmer in the wind, requiring a difficulty 7 (Perception + Awareness) roll to detect. It’s impossible to track without magic like Unshakeable Bloodhound Technique (Exalted, p. 410); rolls to do so suffer a −5 penalty. Other Sidereals using Mirror-Shattering Method can interact with the ship; magic like Silver Curtain Parted (Lunars, p. 249) can let characters board the ship if they detect it. Alternatively, the Sidereal can lead a journey through the sea to other worlds: Yu-Shan’s quicksilver sea; the Demon City’s ocean, who is the Yozi Kimbery; the Underworld’s many rivers, etc. Such travel always takes five days, leading to a destination as above.
