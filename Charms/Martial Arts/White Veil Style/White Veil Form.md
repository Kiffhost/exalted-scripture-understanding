The White Veil stylist puts herself completely at ease, her palpable nonchalance drawing onlookers’ attention from whatever she’s doing with her hands to focus on her pleasant smile and witty repartee. She gains +1 Evasion and +1 Guile, and takes no penalty for flurrying if she includes at least one Socialize-based action. She may substitute Manipulation for Dexterity when calculating her Evasion or when rolling to enter concealment, disengage, or withdraw. Any enemy that rolls Join Battle in response to her actions rolls must roll with (Perception + [lower of Awareness or Socialize]). 

## Special activation rules

When the stylist successfully lands a surprise attack against a nontrivial enemy, she may reflexively enter this Form.
