The Sidereal’s case leads her down into the lurid theater of the subconscious, seeking counsel from the multitude of herself. As the Sidereal sleeps, her player chooses a clue she’s uncovered recently with a case scene or profile character action. Each other player (including the Storyteller) chooses one of the Sidereal’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. The Sidereal dreams of her investigation — whether a picture-perfect replica of the crime scene or a grotesque symbolist nightmare — and receives counsel from personifications of the chosen [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], each roleplayed by the player who selected it. The scene ends once each [[Intimacy]] that wants to has offered its opinion as to how the Sidereal should follow up on the clue. These suggestions must be mutually exclusive, an [[Intimacy]] can’t “yes, and” another’s advice. If the Sidereal subsequently acts on one of these suggestions, it counts as upholding the [[Intimacy]] that suggested it and is guaranteed to be productive for her case no matter how foolish it is or how disastrously it goes. She might find another clue that substantially advances her investigation; befriend a Storyteller character who can provide useful information, assets, or assistance; learn a weakness or vulnerability of a powerful suspect; etc. Conversely, the other [[Intimacy]]’s suggestions lead only to dead ends; the Sidereal automatically fails any [[Investigation]] rolls or other rolls that could potentially provide useful information or advantages in the case. The Sidereal’s dream is privileged against intrusion; she receives +5 non-Charm [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]] against any magic that would let another view, enter, or tamper with her dreams. Effects that don’t normally require a roll must be rolled with an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) pool against whichever static value is most appropriate.
