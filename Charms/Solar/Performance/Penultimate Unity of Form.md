*Channeling [[Essence]] through her mastery of [[Performance]], the Exalt can momentarily meld all performance styles into a single action.*
This Charm allows the Exalt to switch methods between oration, dancing, singing, and playing an instrument. What she could previously only accomplish with oration, she can now accomplish with a dance. Strumming her sanxian, she could start a riot, activating [[Fury Inciting Speech]] without ever saying a word. This does not change the definitions of supplemental [[Charms]]; the Exalt can perform [[Shining Expression Style]] by singing instead of dancing, but can’t use [[Graceful Reed Dancing]] to enhance her voice. If the Exalt’s influence is successful against her primary target, be it a group or a specific individual, she gains a point of temporary [[Willpower]].
