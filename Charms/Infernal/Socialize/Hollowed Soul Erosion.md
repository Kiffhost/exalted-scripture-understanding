*The Infernal’s words wear down hope, joy, and love. Hasn’t humanity heard? The world is a cruel place.*

The Infernal rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on an instill roll with any Ability to weaken a positive Intimacy or instill a negative Intimacy. It also applies on rolls to instill Principles of obedience to a law of Hell that’s previously been established in play.

The Infernal can join in this bleak cynicism, weakening one of her own positive Intimacies to add (Intimacy) non-Charm dice on the roll. (This uses the Intimacy’s intensity from before it’s weakened).
## [[Keys]]

For a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, resisting this influence requires entering a Decision Point and citing a Major or Defining Intimacy. If the Infernal seeks to weaken an Intimacy, her target can’t cite it in the decision point.
