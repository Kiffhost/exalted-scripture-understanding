*Tarantula’s Grip The Exalt tangles an opponent with silk that takes on a life of its own, assuming a wiry bipedal form and seizing her foe.*
With a successful grapple gambit, this fabric doppelganger is rolled into battle with ([[Wits]] + [[Craft]] {Weaving}) and takes control of the grapple on her behalf. It uses the Exalt’s unmodified dice pools, has its own [[Initiative]], and can take no actions other than savage, restrain, or release actions. Its [[Defense|Evasion]] is (higher of [[Dodge]] or [[Melee]]), and it has ([[Essence]]) −0 health levels. The [[Snarled-Silk Pankratiast]] persists until killed or crashed, or until it runs out of rounds of control — whichever comes first — then unravels into lifeless threads. The [[Snarled-Silk Pankratiast]] gains the ability to perform throw/slam actions at [[Essence]] 4+, and drag actions at [[Essence]] 5+.
