*Death’s Lawgiver brings even the fiercest beasts to heel with her terrifying presence and eternal tenacity.*
The Abyssal adds (Essence) automatic successes on a roll to train an animal (Exalted, p. 554) and shortens the interval to one week. She waives the usual specialty requirements. While using Superior Predator Style, she ignores penalties for working with wild or hostile animals.
With Survival 5, Essence 3, the Abyssal can train a familiar that she’s enhanced with Fetter the Beast to teach it a magical ability for two experience points.
