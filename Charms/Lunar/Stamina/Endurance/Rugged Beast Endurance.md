*A paramount survivor, the Lunar thrives in Creation’s harshest reaches.*
She adapts to a particular environment — searing desert, mosquito-ridden swamp, freezing cold, etc. — gaining temporary [[Survival]] and [[Resistance]] specialties in that clime. She ignores environmental penalties on rolls those specialties apply to, and ignores deleterious effects of exposure to that clime. She can change her adaptation (e.g., while traveling through the Wyld) by using this Charm again, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost if the first use is still active. A [[Stamina]] 4, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase halves the damage that the chosen clime’s [[Environmental Hazards]] roll against her, rounded down. This also applies to hazards similar in nature to that environment: A Lunar adapted to frigid cold extends this resilience to icy mist conjured by a raksha. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes native to the chosen environment or adapted to surviving in it, the Lunar receives a one-mote discount on [[Charms]] enhancing [[Survival]] or [[Resistance]] rolls in the chosen clime.
