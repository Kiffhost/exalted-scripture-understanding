As the Solar meditates on the stillness of the predator, the color leaches out of Hunting Hawk’s brilliant orichalcum limbs, and thence out of the Solar herself, until she vanishes into the network of sky and leaves. The Solar rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) to establish stealth, and may re-roll up to ([[Archery]] / 2, round up) failed dice. This Evocation only functions if the Solar is elevated above those she wishes to conceal herself from—such as crouching on a tree branch, standing on a flying carpet, or otherwise lurking somewhere off the ground. Any elevated position counts as sufficient concealment to attempt to use this Evocation. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no experience cost once the Solar has used Hunting Hawk to stalk and slay a beast or monster fearsome enough to challenge even her own Exalted prowess.
