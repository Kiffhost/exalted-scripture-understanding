This hearthstone is a murky blue-black, full of shifting shades. When mounted in an attuned hearthstone socket, the Freedom Stone grants the opportunity to awaken the following Evocations:
Chains Cast Into Water
Cost: —; Mins: Essence 1
Type: Permanent
Keywords: None
Duration: Permanent
Prerequisite Charms: None
The Exalt permanently gains two automatic successes on attempts to escape from inanimate bonds, such as ropes, chains, or binding cuffs; they slide across her skin as though it were slick with water. This Evocation doesn’t help with escaping from more general restraint, such as a dungeon cell, though it could get the Exalt free of a leg manacle within the cell.
Rain-Grasping Evasion
Cost: 1m, 1wp; Mins: Essence 1
Type: Reflexive
Keywords: None
Duration: Instant
Prerequisite Charms: None
If the Exalt manages to roll more successes than his attacker during the control roll of a grapple, she may activate this Evocation to immediately slip free and end the grapple before she can be savaged, restrained, thrown, or otherwise affected.
Sinuous Liquid Escape
Cost: 2m; Mins: Essence 2
Type: Reflexive
Keywords: None
Duration: Instant
Prerequisite Charms: Rain-Grasping Evasion
The Exalt is slippery indeed, and can be nigh-impossible to hold once caught. This Evocation allows the character to use (Dexterity + Dodge) in a hostile grapple’s control roll.
