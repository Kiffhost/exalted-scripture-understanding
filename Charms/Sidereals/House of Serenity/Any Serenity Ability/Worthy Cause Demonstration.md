The Sidereal’s joy in life makes clear the righteousness of her cause and the wickedness of those who oppose one so serene. While the Sidereal openly presents herself as a member of a group that is oppressed by or defined by its opposition to another group — a rebellion, enslaved laborers, a heretical cult, an artistic counterculture, the Gold Faction, etc. — those who interact with her are swayed to her side. They count as having a Minor Tie of sympathy to the Sidereal’s group and a Minor Tie of condemnation to the other group. If a character already has a Tie a group whose emotional context opposes the one imposed by this Charm, he instead treats that Tie as one step weaker (though the other Tie is imposed normally).
