*Magpie’s Talon moves as deftly as any thief ’s fingers, sowing chaos from afar.*
The wielder makes a [[Larceny]] roll for pickpocketing or theft out to short range by throwing Magpie’s Talon.
If successful, she retrieves the stolen object, typically catching it as it ricochets into her hand. As with attacks, if the roll botches, Magpie’s Talon doesn’t return to the wielder’s hand.
If the wielder knows a Charm that lets her steal objects or take similar [[Larceny]] actions from afar, like [[Magpie’s Invisible Talon]] (Exalted, p. 319), she can instead use this Evocation with it to extend that Charm’s range by one band. If that Charm’s range isn’t measured in range bands, it becomes medium range instead.
## Resonant
A successful roll in combat awards one [[Initiative]].
