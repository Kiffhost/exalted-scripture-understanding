The Lunar assails her foe with overwhelming strength, tossing him about like a ragdoll. When she savages, throws, or slams a grappled foe, she doubles 9s on a withering damage roll or adds ([[Essence]]) dice to a decisive damage roll. The number of forfeited rounds of control she can benefit from on a throw or slam is doubled, and she can throw enemies out to short range.
