*Flowing and transcendent, the Lunar denies the boundary between herself and the world, and so cannot be harmed by anything in it.*
After a non-gambit decisive attack beats her [[Defense|Evasion]], but before damage is rolled, she can use this Charm, rolling (current temporary [[Willpower]] + her [[Defense|Evasion]] against the attack), unmodified by any other effects. If the attack would inflict fewer levels of damage than her successes, it’s negated entirely, passing harmlessly through her. She’s considered to have dodged it. This doesn’t apply against attacks that would deal enough damage to incapacitate her. This Charm can only be used once per day unless reset by dodging every attack made against her, minimum three, in a combat scene involving at least one nontrivial enemy. This can include the scene she used it in, assuming she’s dodged every attack prior to using it.
