*Even in death, the Ichneumon Blades won’t release their brood’s hosts.*
When the wielder’s decisive attack kills a human with any embedded splinters, she may use this Evocation to reanimate him as a zombie (Exalted, p. 502), which is immediately rolled into battle. These zombies loyally follow her commands, suffering no ill effects from embedded splinters. This Evocation’s cost is reduced by one mote for each splinter past the first embedded in its victim.
