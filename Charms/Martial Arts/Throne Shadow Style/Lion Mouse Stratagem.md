*The vizier affects the unassuming air of the neophyte and the hanger on, presenting herself as something less than she is.* 
The stylist gains +1 [[Guile]]. When characters roll against her [[Guile]] to reveal her hostile intentions or pierce a disguise that makes her seem less dangerous than she is, they reroll a successful die for each 1 (maximum stylistâ€™s [[Essence]]), starting with the lowest number and going up.
In combat, the stylist instead gains +2 [[Guile]] and 1s on opposing rolls subtract successes in addition to rerolling dice.
