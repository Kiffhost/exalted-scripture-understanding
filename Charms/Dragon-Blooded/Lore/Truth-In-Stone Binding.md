Drawing on her knowledge of the world and understanding of its Essence, the Dragon-Blooded may speak truths antithetical to the chaos of the Wyld, sealing away those horrors that have no place in Creation. She rolls a special gambit with (Intelligence + Lore) against the Resolve of a raksha or other native of the Wyld within short range. The gambit’s difficulty is (higher of target’s Essence or Willpower); battle groups add (Size) to the difficulty. Success incapacitates the enemy, petrifying its Essence into an inanimate form engraved with words of binding that describe the horror trapped within. A raksha might be imprisoned within an egg of jade, while a swarm of hobgoblins might be transformed into stone gargoyles. The bound creatures aren’t truly slain, and are restored if the binding words are scratched out or destroyed. The specifics of how this is achieved are left to the Storyteller, but the difficulty should be commensurate with the power of the sealed character, possibly requiring high-level feats of strength, specially crafted artifacts, or sorcery to accomplish. This Charm can also be used on environmental features of the Wyld, such as a river of flames that lures in travelers with whispers, or a memory-eating mist. She rolls (Intelligence + Lore) against a difficulty equal to the base difficulty of the hazard or whatever roll is used to resist it, plus a modifier based on the intensity of the surrounding Wyld: +2 in the bordermarches that lap up against Creation, +4 in the middlemarches that lie beyond, and +6 in the deep Wyld, the heart of chaos. Success seals away the hazard, rendering it inert and harmless: The lake of fire cools into a glassy patch of obsidian; the mist condenses into crystalline droplets. At the Storyteller’s discretion, overwhelmingly powerful targets — such as uniquely powerful raksha or Wyld behemoths, or equally potent environmental manifestations of the Wyld — can only be sealed away temporarily. Such bindings last a scene at Essence 3, a day at Essence 4, and a year and a day at Essence 5.
