*The Infernal squeezes her anima banner into the palm of her hand, crushing it into a gemstone lit with the Green Sun’s light.*

The Infernal bleeds off her anima banner, compressing it into a radiant jewel in her anima’s colours. It might be embedded in her flesh or worn as jewellery, but it can’t be separated from the Infernal’s person. It glows from within, but noticing this requires a difficulty 5 (Perception + Awareness) roll. When she ends this Charm, her anima bursts forth from the jewel. It remains intact, but ceases to glow.

The Infernal can stack multiple uses of this Charm to conceal additional levels of anima.

With Essence 5, if the Infernal ends this Charm while she has at least four levels of anima stored in the jewel, she rolls (Essence) dice with double 8s, plus an additional die for each level of anima beyond that. She gains peripheral motes equal to her successes as she returns to bonfire anima.

#### Power Beyond Price
The Infernal awakens an Evocation for the jewel created by this Charm. Its themes and functions derive from the Infernal’s personality, Caste, iconic anima banner, and her personal reasons for employing stealth and subterfuge. She can only use this while this Charm is active. This key can be purchased any number of times.
