*While using the scene-long version of the prerequisite, the Solar may channel the raw fury of her iconic anima down into her fists, suffusing them with blazing Solar [[Essence]].*
For the rest of the scene, her decisive attacks ignore hardness, and her base [[Initiative]] is increased by one. In addition, when she is at base [[Initiative]] or lower, her decisive damage gains ([[Essence]]) bonus dice and rerolls 1s and 10s until 1s and 10s fail to appear, retaining any successes from rerolled 10s. This effect costs one mote per turn to maintain. This Charm requires three levels of anima to use, and use of this Charm returns the Lawgiver’s anima to the dim level. While this Charm is active, the Solar’s fists glow gold-to-white and her Caste Mark shines brightly. These effects cannot be muted.
