*The fae remember Allia’s beautiful music, and even the cruelest Fair Folk cannot bear to harm those who continue her song.*
While the Lunar uses [[Crossroads Walker Entreaty]] (p. XX), as long as she plays [[Night’s Sweet Whisper]] and takes no non-reflexive actions, fae can’t attack her or otherwise attempt to harm her, even if they’ve paid [[Willpower]] to engage in hostilities. She can extend Crossroads Walker Entreaty’s duration to Indefinite, although such activations only apply to fae.
