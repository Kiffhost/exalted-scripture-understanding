The Lunar’s crimes are the crimes of the blameless, howling night. She adds (Essence) successes on a conceal evidence roll. Characters that fail opposing Investigation rolls believe they succeeded, but uncover a clue consistent with one of the following false results of the Lunar’s choice: Crime Without Motive: The evidence points to a crime of opportunity, committed by petty criminals or undesirables. Escaped Tiger Tragedy: The evidence points toward actions of wild animals. Nameless Horror Omen: The evidence points to involvement of spirits, fae, or other inhuman creatures. Only the Wind: The evidence points to freak weather, an accidental fire, or similar natural disasters. Wicked Tyrant’s Hand: The evidence points to involvement of someone with authority over the victim or investigator. With a Manipulation 5, Essence 2 repurchase, the Lunar may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to make investigators think the false evidence is genuine even on a successful Investigation roll, in addition to the true evidence. The investigator is aware of the discrepancy, but not of which piece of evidence is true. This effect can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through criminal means.
