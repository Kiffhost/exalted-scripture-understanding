The Dragon-Blood stirs the winds of the spirit world into a mighty storm. She rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) with double 9s to create a mystical vortex extending out to medium range, and chooses whether it repels spirits and other dematerialized characters or draws them in. Both material and dematerialized spirits are affected. Each target whose [[Resolve]] is beaten is blown one range band in the chosen direction. As long as they remain within medium range of the Exalt, they cannot use Hurry Home to escape and treat any movement opposing the whirlwindâ€™sdirectionasdifficultterrain(Exalted,p.199).
