## World-Soul Rite
The sorcerer draws power from the Caul or another place of power touched by Gaia’s or Luna’s Essence, like a demesne or manse with an elemental or Lunar aspect. Once per day, she can roll (Wits + Occult) in such a place, gaining sorcerous motes equal to her successes. They last for the rest of the story or until she uses this ritual again.
