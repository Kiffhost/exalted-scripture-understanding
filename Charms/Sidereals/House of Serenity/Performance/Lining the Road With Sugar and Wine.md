Playing in perfect harmony with destiny, the Sidereal reveals the path to happiness. When the Sidereal makes a persuade roll against a single character to convince him to do something that she genuinely believes would be beneficial for him, she lowers by one the level of Intimacy needed to justify her influence (Exalted, p. 216) and increases the Willpower cost to resist by one. She can’t be perceived as the influence’s source. If the target successfully accomplishes a life-defining task, it counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX).
