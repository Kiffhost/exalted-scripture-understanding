*The Infernal confidently steps into the path of an attack, letting it hit her full on to prove her invincibility.*

The Infernal lets a decisive attack hit her. forgoing the chance to defend against it by any means except her unarmed Parry. She does not actively block the attack, instead “parrying” with her own invincible flesh. This uses her unarmed Parry, and lets her parry unblockable attacks. She can’t use it together with a clash attack.

If the attack hits the Infernal, she can pay four motes, one Willpower to subtract her total Parry from the attack’s damage dice, before it’s compared to her Hardness. If she doesn’t take any damage, she counts as having blocked the attack.

Alternatively, the Infernal can use this Charm to perfectly defend against falling damage a source of uncountable damage, rendering her immune to recurring sources for a scene.
## Reset
The Infernal can only use this Charm’s Hardness bonus once per scene, unless reset by going a full round without taking any damage.
## [[Keys]]
#### Invincible Demon-Emperor Rampage (Resistance 5, Essence 5)
When the Infernal uses this Charm’s Hardness bonus, she retains it for the rest of the scene and adds it to her soak as well. This can’t raise her total soak above ({Stamina + Resistance} x3). She loses these benefits if she’s crashed or if she goes a round without either making a decisive attack or spending 8+ motes on offensive magic.
