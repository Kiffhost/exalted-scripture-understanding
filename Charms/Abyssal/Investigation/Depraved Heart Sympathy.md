*The Abyssal knows the guilty mind well, needing only the scantest of evidence to lay bare a culprit’s heart.*
The Abyssal makes a profile character roll by examining someone’s belongings, physical evidence of their activities, or the like, without having to observe him directly. Access to abundant evidence or items of personal importance to a suspect might grant circumstantial bonus dice, while sparse, outdated, or misleading evidence inflicts a penalty. Tasting someone’s blood suffices as long as it was shed no more than an hour ago, and adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm successes on the roll.
If the Abyssal successfully profiles her target, she can then commit this Charm’s cost to preserve the profile in her memory. Doing so reduces Uncanny Detective Practice’s cost by two motes when used to follow up on that investigation. Additionally, [[Crime-Unveiling Wickedness]] alerts her to anyone who fits the profile or any sequence of events that’s consistent with the profiled character’s customary methodology.
