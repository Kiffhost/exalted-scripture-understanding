*Not all possibilities can coexist. Choose carefully which ones you let survive.*
The stylist rolls a ([[Perception]] + [[Martial Arts]]) gambit against an enemy within short range of a reflective surface that’s at least as large as he is. The gambit’s difficulty is the higher of her target’s [[Essence]] or base [[Resolve]]. If successful, she draws her enemy’s reflection forth from the mirror to fight him. Its appearance mirrors the target’s, but has some subtle difference. The reflection’s traits are identical to the target’s (including how many motes, [[Initiative]], [[Willpower]], undamaged health levels, etc. it has). It has copies of all artifacts and other equipment the target possesses. It has a Defining Tie of hatred toward him, a Defining Tie of loyalty toward the stylist, and no other Intimacies. Its sole goal in combat is to kill the target — while it will act in self-preservation, it won’t attack other enemies, help the stylist or her allies, or the like. 
Once the scene ends, the reflection and its equipment shatter into reflective black glass. Equipment taken from it likewise shatters into glass unless retrieved by the next round’s end. The target doesn’t appear in mirrors until then. If the reflection is incapacitated, the target doesn’t regain it until the story ends. Mortals never regain them. 
## Enlightenment
This Charm’s duration becomes indefinite. The stylist must pay one [[Willpower]] each subsequent day to maintain it. 
## Reset
Once per scene.
