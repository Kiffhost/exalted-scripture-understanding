Knowledge is the spark that lights the tinder of curiosity, crackling like flame from the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s lips as she expounds her teachings. She rolls ([Charisma or Intelligence] + Lore), which is treated both as a roll to introduce a fact and as an influence roll to instill all characters who hear her with an Intimacy of interest or fascination towards the proposed fact or a broader field it relates to. She ignores the penalty for targeting multiple characters with the influence roll. To resist, a character must spend Willpower equal to (his Intelligence/2, rounded up). Likewise, the instilled Intimacy cannot be voluntarily lowered until the target spends (his Intelligence/2, rounded up) Willpower, while attempts to erode it with instill actions follow the rules for overturning social influence (Exalted, p. 221).
