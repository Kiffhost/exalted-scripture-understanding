Hunting the Secret Self (Essence 2; Whispering
Heart Revelation): Complete a sacred hunt by witnessing your quarry do something he’d never do if
he knew someone else was watching.
Swift Hunter's Eye (Essence 2; Prowling Stalker Concentration): The Lunar can use Prowling
Stalker Concentration instantly, without needing to
survey the area. When she defends against an ambush with Observed Prey Instinct, she can spend
banked successes to raise her Defense up to its
base rating. With Essence 3, winning Join Battle
lets her use it reflexively to bank her Join Battle
successes.
Eye-and-Fingertip Wisdom (Essence 3; Fivefold
Transcendent Insight): The Lunar can use Charms
that only enhance a specific sense with any of her
senses through creative stunting.
Enemy Within Infestation (Essence 4; Behind
the Beast’s Eyes, Flowing Moonsilver Infiltration,
Sense-Borrowing Method x2): The Lunar merges
with an enemy’s body, becoming a parasitic presence within him. This is a special grapple that lets
her control his body while she maintains it and renders him vulnerable to Memory-Drinking Meditation. Trivial characters can be controlled indefinitely.
