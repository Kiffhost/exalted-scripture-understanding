*Danger is fun, and fun is best savoured. So it is that the Infernal’s perception of time slows to a crawl as she senses imminent threats.*

When an enemy makes an unexpected attack against the Infernal, she rolls ({Perception or Wits} + Awareness) opposing the attack roll. She adds non-Charm successes equal to the attack roll’s 1s.

Against a surprise attack, success negates its Defense penalty. Against an ambush, she can defend normally — including using Charms — but reduces her Defense to 2. Every two extra successes she rolls increases this by +1, up to a maximum of her base Defense.
### Keys
#### Familiar Threat Delight
The Infernal waives this Charm’s cost against enemies whose unexpected attacks she’s successfully defended against with this Charm this scene, or whose Stealth she’s beaten with an Awareness roll.
