The Solar channels [[Essence]] through her enduring toughness, hardening her skin and muscles beyond their mortal limits. After an attack hits her, but before damage is rolled, she may increase her soak at a rate of one mote per point. She may no more than double her natural soak in this fashion. This effect is incompatible with any magic that allows the Exalt to soak a decisive attack with witheringonly magic. At [[Resistance]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, the Solar may use this Charm to remove successful dice of withering damage after damage has been rolled, at a rate of two motes per success. This use costs one point of [[Willpower]], two points of [[Initiative]], and has the Perilous keyword.
