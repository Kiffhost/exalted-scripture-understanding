Flaws and openings in her foe’s defense draw the Exalt’s blade as the mountain draws the lightning. The Dragon-Blood makes a number of withering attacks against a single opponent equal to his onslaught penalty at the time she activates this Charm, maximum ([[Dexterity]] + [[Strength]]), static crackling around her as spent [[Essence]] builds a charge in the air. Each withering damage roll only grants [[Initiative]] equal to half the damage inflicted, rounded down. 

In Air Aura, the Dragon-Blood may use the final attack of this Charm to make a decisive attack instead of a withering attack, channeling the electric charge that has built around her into a final, devastating flash. This attack resets her to base [[Initiative]] even if it misses. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by dealing enough decisive damage with a single attack to incapacitate a nontrivial enemy with an uninjured health track.
