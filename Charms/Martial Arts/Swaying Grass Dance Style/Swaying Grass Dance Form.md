*The stylist sways and dances rhythmically, shuffling in and out of combat-ready stances with unpredictable fluidity and playful cunning.*
She gains +1 Evasion, and ignores penalties for fighting prone. She doubles 10s on decisive damage rolls for unexpected attacks and attacks against prone enemies, and waives [[Initiative]] costs for attacking with improvised equivalents of style weapons. She can use [[Performance]] instead of [[Athletics]] for rushes and [[Stealth]] to establish concealment. 
## Special activation rules
If the stylist beats the [[Resolve]] of a nontrivial enemy at close range with a dance-based [[Performance]] roll, she may reflexively enter this Form.
