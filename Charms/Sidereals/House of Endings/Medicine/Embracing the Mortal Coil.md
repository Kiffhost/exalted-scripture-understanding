*Offering philosophical guidance or spiritual insights, the Sidereal helps patients accept the frailties of flesh, facing such ailments with dignity and grace.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Medicine]]) against a living character to instill an [[Intimacy]] that supports accepting one’s mortality. (No roll is necessary if the target’s willing). An affected character gains ([[Intimacy]]) soak, ignores the effects of disease, and ignores up to ([[Intimacy]]/2, rounded up) points of penalties from wounds, fatigue, poison, and crippling effects.
