The Dragon-Blood’s calligraphy ripples like the surface of a pond and settles into another writer’s hand. She rolls (Manipulation + Linguistics) to forge another character’s handwriting and mimic his writing style. If she includes written social influence in the forgery, she uses the same roll. Using this Charm requires access to either a full manuscript or three smaller samples of the character’s writing. A reader may roll (Perception + Linguistics) opposing the Dragon-Blood’s roll to detect the forgery, granting +2 Resolve against any influence it contains.
