*Her Essence as one with that of her weapons, the stylist takes on their weightless grace, rising to join them in their air.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must be using Thousand Blades Form or Sword-Shrike’s Garden. She can fly using her signature weapons, either riding atop one as it moves through the air or rising up as if her signature weapons were wings. She adds (Arsenal) dice on aerial movement rolls. She can’t rise higher than medium range from the ground unless moving toward an aerial enemy.
## Terrestrial
This Charm is Perilous and ends if the stylist is crashed. She must pay 4 Initiative on each subsequent turn to maintain it.
