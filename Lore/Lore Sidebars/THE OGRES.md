In Immaculate fables, the No Moons are hideous, grotesque beasts so twisted and disturbing they can only work their evil in the darkest nights. Driven by an insatiable lust for power, they forge pacts with demons and forsaken gods so terrible their names canâ€™t be spoken in any but the brightest light without fear of summoning them. Only the righteous Dragon-Blooded can root these deformed creatures out of their fetid swamps and twisted groves, ending their threat to the innocent and the pure. For their demonic magics and blasphemous dealings, these Anathema are called the Ogres.
