Even as things seem darkest, Sunset Blaze’s master lights the way to hope. When the wielder makes an influence roll to overturn influence (Exalted, p. 221) that Rally the Upright Soldier applies against, she waives the Willpower cost to do so and adds (Essence) automatic successes. This doesn’t allow her to overturn Psyche effects with her influence unless they’re normally susceptible to being overturned.
## Resonant
The added successes are non-Charm.
