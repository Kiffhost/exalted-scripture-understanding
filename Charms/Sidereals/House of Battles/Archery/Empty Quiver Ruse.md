Not all of the Sidereal’s shots are meant to hit; her feints are indistinguishable from her true offense. After the Sidereal misses an attack, she can use this Charm to convert that attack to a distract gambit that automatically hits. Charms enhancing her attack that aren’t compatible with distract gambits don’t apply.
