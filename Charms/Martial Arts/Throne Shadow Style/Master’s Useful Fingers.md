Disdaining such crude implements as blades, fists, and appropriated barstools, the vizier turns others into her weapons. The stylist can train another character over a scene of conversation, sparring, or combat, letting him go into experience debt (p. XX) to purchase either the Martial Artist Merit, a single dot in a Martial Arts Ability, or a Martial Arts specialty. He can’t purchase dots in Martial Arts the stylist doesn’t know and can’t raise his rating above the stylist’s. If the character chooses to go into experience debt, he becomes one of the stylist’s shadow fingers, students and disciples who benefit from other Throne Shadow Charms. The stylist can have up to (Essence x2) shadow fingers at a time; claiming more requires revoking an existing shadow finger’s status. 
## Mastery

The stylist can train her student in up to (higher of Essence or 3) dots in Martial Arts Abilities and/or specialties with a single use of this Charm. With Martial Arts 5, Essence 3, she can instead teach him any Martial Arts Charm she knows whose prerequisites he meets; Sidereals may teach Sidereal Martial Arts Charms this way. 
## Terrestrial

The stylist’s tutelage requires training time rather than occurring in a single scene, though the amount of time necessary is divided by the stylist’s (Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation) — whichever best fits her teaching style.
