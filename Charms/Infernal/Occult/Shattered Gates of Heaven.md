*Heaven is not safe from the Green Sun Prince’s wrath.*

The Infernal rolls ({Intelligence or Wits} + Occult) to enter a god’s sanctum, use an otherwise inaccessible portal, cross between realms of existence, or temporarily breach a magical barrier. The roll’s difficulty equals the Essence of the character who created or owns the gateway or boundary. If no such character exists, the Storyteller assigns a difficulty from 1-5.

Success lets the Infernal and (Essence × 2) companions pass through safely. The Infernal may choose to reveal her intrusion to the opposing character as a sudden sense of horrifying dread, treating her roll for this Charm as a roll to instil a Tie of fear to the unknown intruder.
