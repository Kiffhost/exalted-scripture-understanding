The Storyteller can allow a binding to happen offscreen, requiring several hours or days of work, depending on the local prevalence of Wyld creatures. Targets with high Essence, bodyguards, or other forms of protection always require on-screen capture. Powerful creatures (Essence 4+) cannot be bound unless the characters undertake a suitably arduous quest to discover some hither-to unknown weakness or some other suitably difficult task at the Storytellerâ€™s discretion.
