*In death, the foes of House Iselsi serve as a gruesome warning to their kin that none are safe from the Vendetta.*
This Evocation can be used when the wielder kills a despised enemy, leaving his remains as reminder to the rest of House Iselsi’s enemies that they’re next on the list. Relatives of the victim, including her Sworn Kin, who discover the body must roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) against a difficulty of (victim’s [[Essence]] + 3). On a failure, they form a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of horror towards House Iselsi that cannot be weakened or altered by any means until the story’s end. If a target already has a related [[Intimacy]], it’s instead strengthened by one step and is likewise protected for the story. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience points. It awakens at no cost and can be used for free when the wielder slays a despised opponent she has a Major or Defining negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] for. Her victim must have been aware of both her presence and her [[Intimacy]] for him. 

## Dissonant
