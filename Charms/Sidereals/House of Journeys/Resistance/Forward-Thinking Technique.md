The Sidereal’s world narrows to her journey, seeing only the next step forward. The Sidereal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Unswerving Juggernaut Principle to gain the following benefits: 
-  +1 Evasion. If she’s unarmored, this bonus is non-Charm. 
-  Against unexpected attacks, the soak bonus increases to ([Dexterity, Stamina, or Strength] + Resistance) and the Hardness bonus increases to (Essence). 
-  She can roll to cover her tracks reflexively, without ending Unswerving Juggernaut Principle. Until a character succeeds on an opposed tracking roll or sees her in motion, he won’t realize she’s moving in a straight line, no matter how obvious this is.
