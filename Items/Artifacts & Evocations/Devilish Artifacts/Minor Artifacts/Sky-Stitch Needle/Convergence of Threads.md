*The needle sews threads of space together in impossibly unorthodox patterns.*

While using [[Knot Anchor]], the wielder can make a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Craft (Tailoring)) roll to sew her current location and the knot’s location together, creating a stable passage. As long as the knot remains intact, any character can pass between the two locations as if walking through an open doorway. The wielder can’t end this Evocation before the knot has dissipated.
