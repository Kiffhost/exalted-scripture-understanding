Calling to the Essence of fire and earth that roils deep beneath her, the sorcerer wills ten tentacles of lava to erupt from the ground, shaking the earth as they burst forward in torrents of molten stone. She designates where each appears, out to as far as long range from her. Together, these form the Magma Kraken. 
It is [[join battle|rolled into battle]] with the sorcerer’s ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]), and has a base [[Initiative]] equal to her [[Essence]]. As it erupts from the ground, any character who is at the point where a tentacle emerges must make a difficulty 2 ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) roll to avoid it, or else be flung one range band away and knocked prone by the eruption. 
The Magma Kraken may acton its turn to make a withering or decisive attack, grapple an enemy, or wreak general havoc on the scenery. It uses the sorcerer’s ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]] + [[Essence]]) for all attack and feat of strength rolls, and each tentacle can strike out to short range from its location. If it becomes necessary for the kraken to make a roll for another action, such as opposing an enemy’s stealth attempt, its dice pool is equal to the sorcerer’s ({Relevant Attribute} + [[Occult]] + [[Essence]]).
[[Magma Kraken]] tentacles have [[Defense|Parry]] and [[Defense|Evasion]] values of 5, and 10 points of soak. 
- Withering attacks made by the [[Magma Kraken]] are treated as medium artifact weapons with the lethal, grappling, and reaching tags. If the kraken uses multiple tentacles to attack, it makes a single attack roll and divides the successes among all targets to determine who is hit, before rolling damage separately for each. Its base [[Strength]] is equal to the sorcerer’s [[Essence]] rating. 
 - Decisive attacks add the sorcerer’s [[Essence]] to their base damage. If the kraken attacks multiple enemies, it makes one attack roll and does not divide those successes, but instead divides its [[Initiative]] among each enemy that it strikes to determine the raw damage of the attack. It must assign at least three points of [[Initiative]] to each enemy. 
 - The kraken may only attempt to grapple a single enemy each turn, and receives a flat total of (five + sorcerer’s [[Essence]]) successes on the control roll. The kraken suffers no penalties from grappling, but a tentacle being used to clinch an enemy cannot make attacks against anyone else. 
 - Destroying scenery such as setting fire to vegetation, melting through stone walls, or uprooting statues counts as a feat of strength. The kraken is treated as having [[Strength]] 10 for determining the feats it may attempt, and doubles 7s on the roll. It may use multiple tentacles together to perform a feat with no penalty. 
The [[Magma Kraken]] cannot be grappled or defeated with standard decisive attacks; destroying a tentacle instead requires a difficulty 5 gambit, stunted in a way that could reasonably disrupt a living pillar of molten stone. At the Storyteller’s discretion, attacks or hazards that affect an area or multiple targets and deal 5+ levels of damage can also destroy any tentacles within their range. 
Destroying a tentacle frees any character being grappled by it. If all ten of the kraken’s tentacles are destroyed, the spell ends. At the end of the scene, the tentacles or their broken remains harden into obsidian and remain fixed where they stand or lie. 
## Control Spell
A sorcerer who knows [[Magma Kraken]] as her control spell is forever chased by magmatic flame. An open fire curls into tentacles around her, or a torch flame licks out from its sconce to light her pipe. When she is angry, the walls or ground become blistered and hot, with faint tentacle shapes writhing in rising smoke. The sorcerer can use these effects to intimidate, set fires, melt minor obstacles and perform other similar stunts. 
## Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
Distorting a [[Magma Kraken]] renders it incapable of perceiving and attacking the distorting sorcerer as well as all allies within close range of her (though this is of limited use if it is already grappling her). If this distortion renders the kraken incapable of perceiving any enemies at all, it will begin using its tentacles to lash out at random in hopes of striking a hidden foe.
