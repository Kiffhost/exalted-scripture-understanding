*A fathomless wellspring of malevolence, the Abyssal corrodes the heart with hatred.*
When the Abyssal makes an [[instill]] roll to create or strengthen a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] that she possesses, her targets suffer –1 [[Resolve]], or –2 if they already have such a Tie.
The deathknight also gains this benefit when weakening positive Ties toward someone or something she has a negative Tie toward. The [[Resolve]] penalty increases to –2 for targets whose Tie is weaker than the Abyssal’s.
