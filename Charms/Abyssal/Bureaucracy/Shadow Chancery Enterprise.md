*Damned The deathknight’s secret plans come to fruition, unseen in the darkness.*
The Abyssal initiates a bureaucratic project or task in complete secrecy. Investigation or Bureaucracy rolls to investigate the project and read intentions rolls that would reveal details of it fail automatically unless they’re enhanced by magic or support a Defining Intimacy. Even then, they suffer a −4 penalty, and 1s subtract successes. For details that wouldn’t normally require a roll to notice, like overhearing a conversation, investigators must roll at difficulty 1.
The organization’s activities might still be evident, even though their details are obscured. If it raises a profane monument in a city square, the ongoing construction would be apparent, but not what is being built.
