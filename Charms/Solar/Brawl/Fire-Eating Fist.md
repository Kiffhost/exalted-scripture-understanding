The Solar’s strike is guided by the violence she feels in her foe’s onslaught. This Charm supplements a clash attack. Any 1s rolled by the attacker are converted to automatic successes on the Solar’s clash. If the Solar dissolves an energy attack or burning elemental bolt, her fist becomes wreathed in her attacker’s [[Essence]], enjoying (opponent’s [[Essence]]) bonus attack and damage dice on her next attack. Attempting to clash a bolt thrown by an assailant out of range of the Solar’s fist lowers the cost of [[Force-Rending Strike]] to four motes, and drops the [[Willpower]] cost. [[Fire-Eating Fist]] does not create a clash attack on its own, and is expressly permitted to enhance [[Martial Arts]] [[Charms]] with the [[Clash]] keyword. At [[Essence]] 4+, this effect becomes stackable to a limit of ([[Stamina]]) stacks. Therefore, clashing four elemental bolts from an [[Essence]] 3 opponent, a [[Stamina]] 4 Lawgiver’s fists would be wreathed with twelve bonus damage worth of pain. In addition, the Exalt may clash away ranged attacks in the exact same manner, treating them as if they were elemental bolts. Note that in all instances of [[Fire-Eating Fist]], clashing a projectile attack by an opponent who is out of range does not result in damage to that opponent.
