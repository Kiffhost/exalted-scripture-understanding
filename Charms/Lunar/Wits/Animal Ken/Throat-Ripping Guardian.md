*The Lunar’s familiar intercepts a blow meant for her, rending her assailant with claw and fang.*
When an enemy attacks her, she may have her familiar reflexively clash with a decisive attack if her attacker’s within range. This counts as its action for the round, or for the next round if it’s already taken its turn. If it loses the clash, her attacker may apply the attack against it instead of her if it’s within his attack’s range. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar is in the shape of the same animal as her familiar, she waives the [[Initiative]] cost of enhancing the attack with [[Instinctive Unity Approach]].
