When the Primordials created the world, they imposed a perfect order upon it. The makers of the universe reigned supreme, taking their leisure at the Games of Divinity. The gods served their
makers, attending to the world they had made and upholding its order. The lesser things knelt in holy dread to worship their creators. But a rot grew unseen beneath this perfect order, the festering perfidy of the gods that drove them to defy the rightful order of the world. What betrayal could be greater?

[[Penumbra]] Castes, too, have seen the rot within their own societies, the hypocrisy of the righteous, the bloodstains on the throne. Some might hold power and prominence among the same societal elite they’ve come to despise, making weapons of wealth and influence. Others were cast down from lofty positions, betrayed by their allies or inferiors: exiled nobles, courtiers ruined by scandal, deposed tyrants. Others were born into a lowly position but climbed society’s echelons, reaching for the power to sabotage it from within. Demonic envoys offer them the power to tear down the diseased society, to sow discord and chaos to orchestrate the ruin of hypocrites, traitors, and dynasties.

The Quills of Hell are subtle in their schemes and designs, moving their pieces in games that others never realize they’re playing. It’s easy to embrace the power offered to them, scheming to lay low princes, judges, and gods they deem unjust. Economies collapse at the stroke of a pen; bureaucracies fall into crisis under ill-conceived policies; carefully cultivated outrage boils over into mob violence. Not all their works must be destructive or malign, but it is the [[Penumbra]] Caste’s remit to destroy that which is wrong, not to create what comes after it.

Hell is the greatest game of all for [[Penumbra]] Castes, a labyrinth of political intrigue, shifting webs of vendettas and alliances, alien economies, treaties riddled with treacherously-worded loopholes, and the wildly unpredictable opposition of other players. Demons employ them to mediate disputes, interpret arcane laws, navigate demonic bureaucracies, make legal problems disappear, or advocate for them as diplomats, heralds, or negotiators. Not all [[Penumbra]] Castes demand payment — a favour owed by the City of Mirrors or the Prince Upon the Tower can be more valuable than any coin.
# Caste Mark
An emerald disc, limned with fiery green sparks.
# Anima Banner
A [[Penumbra]] Caste’s [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Levels|anima banner]] burns with dark greens and purples, with a pure black often spilling outward like ink. They might sound of barely-audible whispering, the clinking of coins in a counting house, or the music of Hell. Some might smell of ink, fragrant perfume, or a sumptuous feast.
# Iconic Anima
The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]]; a scroll inscribed with the Yozis’ surrender oaths, slowly burning to ash; an abacus of brass and bone that tallies the Infernal’s treacheries; a palace crumbling into ruin; a twisting labyrinth of shadows; a Gateway board filled with grotesque piece; a serpent with painted masks for scales.
# Anima Effects
A [[Penumbra]] Caste’s anima lets her seal oaths, invoke pacts of hospitality, and enter her Devil-Body to punish hypocrisy.

In addition to the default [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Effects|anima effects]], [[Penumbra]] Castes can perform the following:
- **Hypocrisy-Trampling Outrage Judgment** (Permanent): The Infernal can enter her [[Devil-Body]] when she recognizes that a significant character opposing her interests or Intimacies has acted against one of his own Major or Defining Intimacies.
- **Infernal Embassy Pact** (Permanent): While conducting diplomacy or other legitimate business with spirits or the Fair Folk, the Infernal and her companions are protected by ancient pacts, requiring her hosts to observe local customs of hospitality and preventing them from attacking her or her entourage. If the Infernal or one of her companions breaks the peace first, they lose this protection.
- **Traitor-Binding Oath** (10m, 1wp; Reflexive; Instant): When the Infernal hears someone make a promise or swear an oath, she may seal the pact by her authority as a Green Sun Prince. She may manifest her [[#Caste Mark]] and [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Levels|anima banner]] in a brief display if she wishes. Those who violate the pact suffer consequences chosen by the Storyteller, often a punishment that reflects the nature of their violation.
