The Sidereal has recreated the constellation of the Sorcerer within her mind from stars of radiant enlightenment; within it, she has found a path to the Sapphire Circle’s mysteries. The Sidereal can use Celestial Circle sorcery. She learns one Celestial spell — an additional control spell — and one shaping ritual for free.
