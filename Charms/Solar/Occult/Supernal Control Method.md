The Exalt directs the flow of her [[Essence]] out of the world and draws it in, bringing back a quickening breath of realms beyond. Once per scene, the Solar may enact a free full [[Occult]] Excellency. This Charm may be reset by raising the Exalt’s anima to iconic and shedding it back to the dim level.
