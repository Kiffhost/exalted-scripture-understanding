*Leave no evidence, permit no pursuit.* The wearer leaves behind no physical evidence when she makes an attack, movement action, feat of demolition, or other physical action with [[Tulat’s Tread]], using her roll as a [[conceal evidence]] roll to hide it. If the action is unrolled, she rolls ([[Manipulation]] + appropriate Ability) — usually ([[Manipulation]] + [[Athletics]]) for reflexive move actions. Her footprints vanish; windows shattered by a kick repair themselves; an upturned table rights itself as spilt food returns to bowls and platters. Attacks enhanced with this Evocation leave no visible wounds, but still deal damage. The wearer may choose to delay the erasure of evidence until the end of her turn, e.g. to pass through a barrier destroyed with a feat of demolition before it’s restored. [[Case scene]] rolls and other rolls that would reveal the action was ever performed fail automatically unless enhanced by magic. Even then, they suffer a −4 penalty. 

## Resonant

Other [[Charms]] and magic that enhance the action are Muted.
