The Lunar raises up sacred heroes to uphold the traditions of their people and guard their ways. Selecting a custom of a culture to which she has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]], she ritually designates a member of that culture as a guardian or enforcer of it. He gains the following benefits: 
-  Other members of that culture intuitively recognize his position, and his social influence benefits from any positive Ties they have toward the culture. 
-  He gains +2 [[Resolve]] against influence contrary to that custom. 
-  He adds (Lunar’s Essence/2, rounded up) dice on read intentions, profile character, or case scene rolls to detect transgressions of the chosen custom, or intent to do so. 
-  He adds (Lunar’s Essence/2, rounded up) dice on influence rolls to convince culture members who’ve violated the custom to atone or accept punishment, or to convince other culture members to assist him in bringing transgressors to justice. 
-  The Lunar can use [[Shining Moon-Child Mark]] reflexively with this Charm, waiving its cost. Once per story, when one of the Lunar’s culture heroes undergoes significant hardship or risk to punish or prevent transgression of his appointed custom, she gains one [[Willpower]] and loses one [[Limit]]. If her Solar mate rules the culture in question, he gains this benefit as well.
