The character possesses more than the normal allotment of limbs—generally in the form of extra arms or legs, but stranger manifestations are possible, such as prehensile tentacles or even an extra head. In all cases, the result is the same—when the character performs a flurry, one of her actions (of the player’s choice) suffers only a -1 rather than a -3 penalty.
Gills (0 or •••)—Innate The character possesses visible gills somewhere on his body, and may breathe comfortably underwater. The free version of this Merit causes the character’s lungs to atrophy, preventing him from breathing air; out of water, he begins suffocating after ([[Stamina]] x 5) minutes. The three dot version makes the character amphibious, able to breathe equally well above or below the water’s surface.
