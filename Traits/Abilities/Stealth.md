**This Ability is important in combat.** 

[[Stealth]] is used to avoid being noticed, evading the sight of oneâ€™s pursuers through physical deftness and cunning. In combat, it can be used to catch foes unawares with sneak attacks or to hide from threatening enemies. Outside of combat, it can be used for covert surveillance, silently infiltrating a guarded building, or blending into a crowd after committing a crime.
