Acting in perfect harmony with a steadfast ally, the Dragon-Blood coordinates a deadly finishing blow. She must spend this Charm’s training time practicing with an ally, developing a signature combination move that requires both characters to perform. A brawler might deliver a crushing uppercut that pushes an enemy into the downswing of her ally’s goremaul; a Righteous Devil stylist might use a firewand to wreathe her partner’s daiklave in flames; a pair of assassins might unleash a storm of throwing knives that comes from all directions.
When this Charm is used, the Dragon-Blood and her ally each make a decisive attack with any Ability against a single enemy. Her ally can move up to one range band in any direction before making the attack. If this is insufficient to bring him within range, or if he’s crashed, this Charm can’t be used. Such is the effectiveness of their combination that both attacks’ onslaught penalties are applied to the enemy’s Defense before the attack rolls are made, and they both use the higher of their two Initiatives to determine the damage rolled. If both have Initiative 15+, they each add (highest of their Essence ratings) dice to the damage roll. This Charm doesn’t count against the ally’s attack or movement actions for the round, although it does count as the Dragon-Blood’s attack.
A character can only participate in this Charm’s combination attack once per day, whether by using this Charm or participating in it as an ally.
This Charm can be repurchased to develop signature combinations with different partners. If one of the Dragon-Blood’s partners dies or otherwise leaves the chronicle permanently, she is refunded the experience cost of her purchase for that partner.
