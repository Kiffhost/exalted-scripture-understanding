*The sorcerer styles herself a marshal of Malfeas, mustering a force to send Heaven quaking.*

The sorcerer summons an army of First Circle demons in a ritual that’s near-identical to casting Demon of the Second Circle (Exalted, p. 477). As the ritual concludes, however, the sorcerer reaches out and shatters the summoning mandala with a rod of Malfean brass, releasing hundreds of fiery green shards that cut open a burning gateway for her army.

The sorcerer summons a battle group of First Circle demons. She chooses its Size, which can range from 2-5, though summoning larger armies is more difficult. It has Might 2 and a Drill that depends on the nature of the demons summoned, though elite Drill is rare, limited to demons such as teodozjia that act in concert or pre-existing group, such as one of Octavian’s battalions. Typically, this battle group consists of a single type of First Circle demon, but the Storyteller may allow suitable mixed groups, such as blood ape cavalry mounted atop agatae or a performing troupe of angyalkas, decanthropes, and gilmynes.

Binding the battle group is an extended (Intelligence + Occult) action with difficulty (group’s Resolve), a goal number of (group’s Size + Willpower), a terminus of (group’s Size), and a one-minute interval. The difficulty is increased by one for groups with average Drill and two for elite. On success, she binds the entire battle group to completing a specific task. Each of its members forms a Defining Principle of “we must complete our task, and a Major Tie of loyalty to group, which can’t be weakened or altered while they remain bound.

On a failed binding roll, the sorcerer rolls (Wits + Occult) at a difficulty of the group’s (Willpower + 3), applying a penalty equal to its Size. Success halves its Size, banishing many of the demons back to Hell. The remainder are released into Creation, unbound to the sorcerer or even each other.
# Control
First Circle demons with Resolve 4 or less are compelled to bow or make some other brief show of respect when the sorcerer passes, even those bound to other sorcerers. She may issue telepathic orders to demons summoned by this spell, so long as they are within the same realm of existence. She can’t receive such messages from the demons, but can sense the distance and direction to them and the general state of their morale.
