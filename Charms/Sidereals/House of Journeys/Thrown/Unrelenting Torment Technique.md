The Sidereal throws a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and Shadow at an enemy; it adheres to him upon impact, wreathing him in an unpleasant, pulsing yellow glow. The Sidereal makes a gambit against a character within long range who has hostile intentions toward her, even if combat hasn’t broken out yet. The gambit’s difficulty is the target’s base Resolve; no Initiative roll is needed outside of combat. On success, the strip affixes itself to the target, imposing a −3 penalty on Stealth rolls. He succumbs to an overpowering, irrational desire to harm the Sidereal, preventing him from taking any non-reflexive actions except to move toward her or attack her. He can pay one Willpower to resist this for a turn. If he can’t perceive the Sidereal, this Psyche effect subsides until he can. Unfortunately for this Charm’s victim, his aggression is turned back on him. When he attacks or rushes the Sidereal, she reflexively makes a withering or decisive attack against him with a hatchet of golden Essence. She can attack him no matter how far away he is, even at extreme range. A character can attempt to remove the affixed prayer tag with a special gambit, rolling (Strength + Athletics) opposing the Sidereal’s (Dexterity + Thrown). A character can substitute a different dice pool with an appropriate stunt. The Initiative roll’s difficulty is 8. The prayer strip remains affixed indefinitely if not removed.
