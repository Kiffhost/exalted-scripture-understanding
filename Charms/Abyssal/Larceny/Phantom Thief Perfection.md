*Reality-Subverting Gesture, [[Villainous Mastermind’s Foresight]] The Abyssal master thief seizes every distraction to work her wickedness unseen.*
The Abyssal can use this after a [[Perception]] roll opposing her [[Larceny]]. 1s and 2s on opposing rolls subtract successes — not just on that roll, but on all opposing rolls made against the Abyssal for this Charm’s duration. This includes rolls made at the same time by other characters. The penalty stacks up to a maximum of (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) successes.
