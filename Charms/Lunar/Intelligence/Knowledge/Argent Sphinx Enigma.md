*The Lunar’s cryptic enigma captivates and beguiles those who hear it, but offers secret wisdom to those who solve it.*
As the Lunar speaks a riddle, her player chooses some area of expertise, comparable in scope to a specialty, that a successful answer provides insight to. (Players don’t actually need come up with a riddle and its answer — they can simply stunt descriptions of the wit and cunning with which they’re spoken).
The Lunar makes an opposed ([[Intelligence]] + {Lore or Occult}) roll against someone who can hear and understand her (or can otherwise perceive and understand the riddle, such as if she uses [[Glance-Oration Technique]] to convey it through body language). In combat, this requires a difficulty 4 gambit against enemies. The Lunar may add up to five non-Charm dice on the other character’s roll by tailoring the riddle to his knowledge, letting her give allies easier riddles.
A character who succeeds discovers an answer to the riddle, gaining insight into the chosen area of expertise. He banks non-Charm successes equal to his total successes on the roll. He can add up to (his [[Essence]]) successes on rolls involving the chosen area of expertise, or to increase a static value by +1 per success when it falls within that expertise. They can’t be added to attack rolls or on extended actions. The pool of successes lasts one day.
A character who fails the roll obsesses over the riddle for the rest of the scene. He must roll ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]) at difficulty 5 each turn as he tries to solve it, requiring him to flurry to take other actions. Success frees him, but offers no insight. He also suffers a −3 penalty on rolls involving the chosen area of expertise, his thoughts still perturbed by the riddle, which lasts until he next rests.
This Charm risks aiding enemies or hindering allies.
Using it again lets the Lunar strip an enemy of his insight if he fails the opposed roll, or free an ally from his captivation if he succeeds. She waives such uses’ [[Willpower]] costs and can use them reflexively, but only once per round on her turn.
Using this Charm to conclude a sacred hunt with ShapeStealer’s Riddle lets the Lunar steal one [[Willpower]] from her target.

## Reset 
This Charm can only be used on a character once per day. This doesn’t apply to using it to negate a previous use’s effect.
