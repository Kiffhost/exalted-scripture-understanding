The Hungering Fangs urge their wielder to seek out monsters in their dens.
When the wielder tracks an enemy who’s powerful enough to pose a challenge to her in combat, she adds (his [[Essence]]) dice on the roll and banks her extra successes. She can add banked successes to the following:
 - [[Awareness]] rolls opposing her quarry (including [[Join Battle]] rolls).
 - [[Stealth]] rolls opposing her quarry.
 - [[Threaten]] rolls against her quarry.
 - [[Introducing a Fact|Introduce fact]] or challenge fact rolls relevant to her quarry or her pursuit of him.
If the wielder is using [[Lessons of the Hunt]] from a past defeat of her quarry, she can add banked successes on attack rolls, or spend them to raise her [[Defense]] against her quarry.
## Resonant
While using [[Lessons of the Hunt]] against her quarry, the wielder can also expend banked successes to add that many dice of damage on a decisive attack, maximum (higher of [[Essence]] or 3).
