*The Abyssal toys with her enemy, evading his blow at the last possible moment to force him to overreach.*
After successfully dodging an attack, the Abyssal can use this Charm to make an unblockable withering counterattack, rolling ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]]). It has (higher of [[Dexterity]] or 3) raw damage. If she damages him, he’s knocked prone and suffers a −3 penalty on rolls to rise from prone.
The Abyssal doesn’t gain [[Initiative]] from hitting or dealing damage, banking half of it, rounded up, in a separate pool. The baneked [[Initiative]] can only be spent on the [[Dodge]] Excellency using Ephemeral [[Presence]] Elusion or on [[Dodge]] [[Charms]]. It’s lost if she’s crashed or uses this Charm again, or once the scene ends.
