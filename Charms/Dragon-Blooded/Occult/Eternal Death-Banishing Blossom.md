*The Dragon-Blood, utterly serene, channels the fierce persistence of life through her anima banner, which branches out like a great tree budding with petals of iridescent light.*
To use this Charm, she must be at bonfire anima. She gains +2 [[Defense]] and ([[Essence]] + 3) bonus soak. Against undead enemies or necromantic attacks, this increases to +3 [[Defense]] and ([[Essence]] + 5) soak. On the Dragon-Blood’s next turn, as long as she’s still at bonfire anima and not crashed, her anima banner finally blooms as she expends it. Petals of shimmering [[Essence]] fall out to medium range from her. This petal-storm is harmless to the living, but any undead or ghost caught in it must succeed on a difficulty 5 ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll or take aggravated damage equal to (the Exalt’s current Initiative/2, rounded up), minimum ([[Essence]]). Even dematerialized undead are affected by the petals. Trivial undead foes are automatically destroyed. Against undead Exalted such as Abyssals and powerful beings such as [[Deathlords]], the damage can’t exceed (her [[Essence]]). This Charm can only be used once per day.
