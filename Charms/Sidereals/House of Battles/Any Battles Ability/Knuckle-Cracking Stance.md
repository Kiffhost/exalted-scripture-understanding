The Sidereal carries herself with the swagger of a battle-seasoned bravo, making clear her willingness to employ violence. The Sidereal can use [[Strength]] instead of social Attributes for threaten rolls and rolls to instill Ties of fear toward her. She may also use [[Strength]] instead of [[Appearance]] to determine how many bonus dice she adds to such rolls and is treated as [[Hideous]] (Exalted, p. 162) for them. In combat, an enemy whose [[Resolve]] is beaten by such a roll loses one [[Initiative]], which the Sidereal doesn’t gain.
