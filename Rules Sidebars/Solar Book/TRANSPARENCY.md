By default, Exalted assumes system transparency—players know what kind of dice pools they’re facing, when their enemy has used a Charm, and so forth, and this applies to social influence as well. However, some Storytellers may prefer more opaque social results in the interest of heightening drama and tension—perhaps you think it’s more interesting if players don’t know whether they really convinced the Lunar warlord, or if he simply took their bribe but plans to betray the characters. Perhaps you’ve got a player who can’t resist acting on out-of-character knowledge. 

In these circumstances, you might not announce when Storyteller characters spend Willpower to reject social influence, or might even roll players’ social actions yourself, behind the screen, so that nobody is sure how well their attempt was received—in this style of play, read intentions actions become even more vital not only to gauge a character’s attitude before approaching them, but afterwards as well!
