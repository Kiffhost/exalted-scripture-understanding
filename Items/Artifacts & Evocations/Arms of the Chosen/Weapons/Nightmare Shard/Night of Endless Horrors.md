Nightmare Shard cuts through a foe’s mind, shattering the chains and fetters that keep his deepest nightmares at bay. The wielder makes a withering attack against an enemy afflicted with cracked mirror blight or a creature of the Wyld, doubling 9s on the damage roll. If this attack crashes its target, it raises the cracked mirror blight’s intensity by one step, and immediately forces a Willpower roll against it. If she crashes an enemy who already has Defining cracked mirror blight or is a creature of the Wyld, he loses one point of Willpower. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack and building to Initiative 12+. 

## Resonant

Crashing a target grants the wielder one Willpower if he fails his Willpower roll, or is a creature of the Wyld.
