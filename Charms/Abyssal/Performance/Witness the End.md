*Chanting ecstatic litanies that disturb her broken patrons’ slumber, the Abyssal reveals an apocalyptic vision that shatters the world around her.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([Charisma or Manipulation] + [[Performance]]) inspire roll ignoring multiple target penalties. Affected characters witness terrifying visions, seeing the world as if it had already ended.
Each affected character loses [[Initiative]] equal to the Abyssal’s extra successes over their [[Resolve]], and suffers the following effects for the rest of the scene:
 - They’re overcome with sorrow, as per a standard inspire roll. If the Abyssal leverages their despair with social influence, the [[Willpower]] cost to resist is increased by one.
 - They treat their positive Intimacies’ intensity as one step lower, and can’t regain [[Willpower]] from upholding them.
 - They suffer a −3 penalty on all rolls. This penalty subtracts successes instead of dice on [[Perception]] and [[Awareness]] rolls and on influence rolls to express positive emotions.
 - At the Storyteller’s discretion, a difficulty 3 ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll may be required to notice positive or uplifting details — like the fact that an ally survived a conflagration of pyreflame — when doing so would normally be unrolled.
 - Seeing the world as a blighted, shattered wasteland, they treat all movement as being through difficult terrain.
Resisting this influence costs three [[Willpower]], but it can’t be resisted by enemies who’re crashed or trivial opponents.. Characters using magic to see through illusion can resist for one [[Willpower]] instead.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal may invoke her [[Whispers]] to add ([[Whispers]]) non-Charm dice on the roll.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can flurry this Charm with [[Grotesque Phantasmagoria]], ignoring all penalties for doing so. Doing so adds +1 to the difficulty of that Charm’s hazard.
