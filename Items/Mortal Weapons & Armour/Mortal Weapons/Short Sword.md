Short swords are weapons with blades about two feet long. Some are single-edged, while others have cutting edges on both sides. They are typically carried as weapons by soldiers and as tools by barbarians. Soldiers use short swords because they make excellent formation-fighting weapons—longer weapons are difficult to manage in close quarters. Barbarians use them as tools because they’re small enough for skinning, butchering and brush-clearing and large enough to fight with in a pinch. Short swords are also favored as backup weapons by spearmen and archers.
