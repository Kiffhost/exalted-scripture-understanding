*Golden Essence limns the stylist’s skin, girding her with orichalcum’s invincibility.*
The stylist can use this Charm after an attack roll against her to gain (Essence + {Lore or Occult}) armored soak against a withering attack or (Essence + {Lore or Occult}) Hardness against a decisive attack.
If the stylist doesn’t take damage, she channels the attack’s force inward, gaining motes equal to the damage roll’s 10s. She can’t gain more than (Essence ×2, maximum 10) motes per round this way.
