The Dragon-Blood’s stoic countenance gives away no more than a mountain’s face. She gains +2 Guile, except against rolls that would reveal a Major or Defining Intimacy based on emotion, or an intention arising out of such an Intimacy. In Earth Aura, this rises to +3 Guile. Even against rolls that would reveal an emotion-based Intimacy or an intention that upholds such an Intimacy, she adds +1 Guile.
