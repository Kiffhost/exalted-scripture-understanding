Some even claim to have struck a Solar. This Charm allows the Exalt to remove damage from a decisive attack after damage has been rolled, at the cost of four motes per cancelled success. A blow cancelled by this Charm appears at first to strike the Solar before missing entirely. Unless using an attack with special [[Initiative]] reset rules, an attack negated by this defense will return the attacker to base [[Initiative]].
