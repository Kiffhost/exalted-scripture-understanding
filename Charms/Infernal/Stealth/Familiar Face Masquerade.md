*The Infernal hides behind her own face, cursing her pursuers to see her reflected a thousandfold wherever they look.*

The Infernal makes a special (Manipulation + Stealth) influence roll against a character that can perceive her. Intimacies don’t modify her target’s Resolve against this. Success distorts the target’s senses, causing him to perceive everyone he sees as being the Infernal, himself included. This isn’t limited to humans, as long as a being’s body shape and size are somewhat close to human. It also applies to reflections, paintings, and other depictions of people.

As long as there are any other characters within short range of the Infernal, she automatically establishes concealment against her target. This represents him being unable to identify the true Infernal, rather than physical concealment that requires a hiding spot. The Infernal breaks this concealment if she does something that clearly identifies her, in addition to the usual ways of breaking concealment. The Infernal can re-establish this concealment against the affected character as long as someone else is within short range, rolling (Manipulation + Stealth). This follows the usual rules for rolling to enter concealment.

A character can spend one Willpower to resist this influence if the Infernal breaks concealment or when a character that he has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward makes a dramatic effort to prove who they are.
## [[Keys]]
#### Broken Glass Symmetry
The Infernal can make affected characters incapable of perceiving any details about the identity or appearance of others, as if they were concealed by Stranger Looks Back, rather than making them look like her.
#### Skewed Reflection Lens ([[#Broken Glass Symmetry]])
Instead of making others look like her, the Infernal can cause her target to see others as being another character who’s present in the scene. The Infernal can only gain concealment from this Charm while within short range of that character.
#### Eternal Mirror Masquerade (Essence 3)
This Charm’s duration becomes Indefinite.
#### One Mirror, Many Shards (Essence 3) (+5m)
The Infernal can pay a five-mote surcharge to use this Charm against any number of characters that can see her.
