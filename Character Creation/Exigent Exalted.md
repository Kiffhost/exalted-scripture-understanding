# Concept, Caste and Basis

*Some Exigents may have additional choice to make at this step.*

Whether or not your character is alone in their Caste, they still receive benefits depending on the basis of their abilities:
## Attribute-Based Exigents
Choose 2 **Caste** **Attributes** 
Chose 1 **Favoured Attribute**
Choose 1 more **Attribute** to be either **Caste** or **Favoured**
- At least one of these must be one of the character’s Primary Attributes. 
- At least one must be a Secondary Attribute. 
*Some Exigents may* assign 1 more dot in each attribute category.
## Ability-Based Exigents
Choose 5 **Caste Abilities**.
Choose 5 **Favoured Abilities**. 
## Essence-Based Exigents
Essence-based Exigents typically don’t receive **Caste** or **Favored Abilities**.
Some have **Caste** traits that reinforce their themes, but rarely more than three **Abilities** or one **Attribute**.
In return, they do not have to meet trait minimums for their Charms.
# Abilities

Divide 28 dots among your abilities.
Maximum of 3 dots per ability (before bonus points are applied).

Choose 4 [[Specialty|Specialties]].
*Some Exigents may* receive additional specific specialties relating to particular extensive training.
# Merits

Assign up to 10 dots to [[Merits]].
*Some Exigents may* receive 5 additional dots to assign to specific Merits.

Optionally take [[Flaws]] for additional experience triggers during play.
