*Five Edicts Dominion rebukes those who lack the strength to pierce it, channeling dead gods’ whispers to speak an incomprehensible word — one lost to all languages, but universally understood as a command to kneel.*
When the wearer is hit by an attack but takes no damage, she may use this Evocation to knock her attacker prone as an invisible weight forces him to his knees. She gains a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of contempt for her attacker, or strengthens such an [[Intimacy]] by one step if she already has one. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wearer exploits a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards herself with a context of subordination or inferiority to lower a target’s [[Resolve]] against her influence, or discovers such a [[Intimacy|Tie]] with a read intentions roll. This encompasses a soldier’s loyalty to her commander, a peasant’s awe at a deadly warrior, or the rage of the oppressed against their tyrants. 

## Resonant

At the wearer’s option, she may channel phantasmal force to knock an attacker one range band back before kneeling him.
