*Named for its resemblance to a lotus flower, a chalice of this sort is carved from a small block of pristine white jade.*
One of the peach-sized mystic pearls of the deepest Western oceans — known for their power to change salt water to fresh — is fused across the cup’s inner surface, giving it a nacreous gleam. 

The lotus-blossom cup’s virtue is purification; mundane poisons and drugs placed in it transmute into pure water. It likewise cleanses potables of the taint of disease. It’s less efficacious against supernatural taint: Halve the duration of magical poisons and drugs, and halve the virulence and morbidity of magical diseases (round down).
