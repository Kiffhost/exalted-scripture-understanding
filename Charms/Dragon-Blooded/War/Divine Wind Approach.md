Drawing on peerless tactical brilliance, the Dragon-Blooded general deploys her troops in an unstoppable fast attack. She Joins Battle with (Intelligence + War), which also counts as an order command action (and can be enhanced with Charms that enhance orders).
She must order a battle group to make an attack. It does so reflexively, before any character takes his turn that round, and can advance one range band toward its foe. This doesn’t count as that battle group’s attack or movement action for the round. Alternatively, the battle group can reflexively aim at the target, and then make a ranged attack that benefits from the order action on its turn.
Using this Charm requires the Dragon-Blood to forgo her turn entirely on the first round, and counts as her attack and movement actions that round. If she enhances the Join Battle roll solely with Air or Balanced Charms, she enters Air Aura.
Once per story, when the Dragon-Blood wins Join Battle, she may pay an additional ten motes and one Willpower to enact an ambush stratagem (Exalted, p. 212), resetting her to base Initiative. If she’s already fighting under a successfully enacted ambush stratagem, this instead renders all attacks her battle groups make for the entire scene surprise attacks, and doesn’t reset her Initiative. This effect can be reset by winning a Strategic Maneuver roll against a general who poses a significant threat.
