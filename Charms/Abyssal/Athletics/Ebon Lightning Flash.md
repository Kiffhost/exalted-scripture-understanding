*The Abyssal lunges towards and past her foe in a single perfect motion, glancing over her shoulder to watch her victim’s corpse split in half.*
To use this Charm, the Abyssal must have Initiative 6+.
She can attack a lower-Initiative enemy within medium range, instantly dashing into close range before she strikes. She doubles the damage dealt by a withering attack or adds (Essence) dice of damage on a decisive attack. This uses her movement action.
This Charm is incompatible with Falling Scythe Attack and the flight from On Wings of Night.
