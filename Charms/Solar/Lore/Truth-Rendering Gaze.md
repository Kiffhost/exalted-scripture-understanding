*By focusing intently on a subject, the Solar can produce a sudden insight.*
This Charm is a ({Mental Attribute} + [[Lore]]) based read intentions action against a difficulty based on whether the subject of this examination falls into the Solar’s area of expertise. 
This read intentions action can be used on an object to reveal its purpose and function, such as with a mysterious artifact, though it does not reveal how to use it. 
It can also be used on geography which the Solar has studied, to give the Lawgiver or the person she is advising (Solar’s [[Essence]]) non-Charm bonus dice for [[Survival]] or [[War]] rolls for the rest of the scene. 
If she is a student of Shogunate architecture, she could tell that a dilapidated structure being used for a market was a Shogunate-era Immaculate temple. If she is a mathematician, the numbers speak to her; she may solve a complex proof in her head, in a matter of seconds. With this Charm, the Solar polymath awakens the world from its dark slumber.
