*The Lunar transgresses norms and taboos without consequence, dancing across forbidden lines with carefree ease.*
When she violates a custom, she makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + {Presence or Socialize}) instill roll against all witnesses who belong to that culture. Affected characters rationalize excuses not to punish, reprimand, or think poorly of the Lunar for this violation — taking her for a foreigner who doesn’t know better; recalling hearing of a heroic deed she’s performed and deciding it justifies overlooking the slight; deciding the violated custom is foolish and ill-considered; etc. They can’t form or strengthen negative Ties toward the Lunar or weaken positive Ties to her as a result of her transgression. Resisting this influence requires entering a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and calling upon a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]]. !!NotethatthisCharmwon’texcuselegalconsequencesfor!! violating laws even if it negates social or cultural stigma. With a [[Manipulation]] 3, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, targets that belong to the culture may opt not to apply [[Resolve]] against the influence. The Lunar is aware of anyone who does so, and may pay one [[Willpower]] to grant each of them a pool of (her [[Essence]]) dice. Those characters may add these dice on influence rolls to convince others to overlook a violation of the same custom, or to argue against the custom itself. These dice are lost if not used within (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) days.
