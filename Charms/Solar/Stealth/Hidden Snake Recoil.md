Like a flashing viper, the Exalt strikes and is gone. Upon incapacitating a target, the Solar may reflexively attempt concealment by rolling (Dexterity + Stealth), adding (Essence) automatic successes. This Charm contributes four motes total to the cost of any Stealth Charms the Solar uses to aid in this attempt.
