Rainwalker’s wielder releases the unfolded parasol to float freely in the air beside her. This Evocation waives the penalties for flurrying a full defense action (Exalted, p. 196) with a non-attack action. In addition, she frees up a hand until her next turn and may reflexively ready a weapon or other object, although she may recall Rainwalker to her hand at any time before her next turn. If this Evocation is used to flurry a full defense with a defend other action (Exalted, p. 196), the distance at which the wielder may protect her ward extends to short range. 

## Resonant

This Evocation’s duration extends to one scene. Rainwalker only levitates when the wielder takes a full defense action.
