*Only a fool draws the monster’s attention while she’s preoccupied with other prey.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she’s attacked while grappling an enemy, after the attack roll. She doesn’t lose a round of control for being attacked and makes a withering counterattack. Its raw damage is reduced to its Overwhelming minimum value, regardless of her enemy’s soak. The Infernal doesn’t gain Initiative from the counterattack.

If the Infernal deals damage, she doesn’t lose a round of grapple control if her enemy’s attack damages her. Additionally, her attacker can’t cause her to lose rounds of control until the end of his next turn. Against enemies that are smaller than her, she only needs to hit with the counterattack to gain this effect.
