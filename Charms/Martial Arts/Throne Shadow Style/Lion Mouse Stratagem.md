*The vizier affects the unassuming air of the neophyte and the hanger on, presenting herself as something less than she is.*
The stylist gains +2 Guile against an effect that would reveal her hostile intentions or pierce a disguise that makes her seem less dangerous than she is. If the stylist rolls Join Battle in the same scene and uses her first turn to attack that enemy, it becomes a surprise attack, inflicting −2 Defense.
Alternatively, the stylist can use this Charm when she makes a distract gambit, concealing the hostile intent behind her actions. She adds (base Guile/2, rounded up) dice on the Initiative roll. Enemies must succeed on a (Perception + Awareness) roll at a difficulty of (stylist’s Essence + Manipulation) to realize she made an attack.
### Mastery
When the stylist makes a surprise attack with this Charm, she adds (base Guile) dice of postsoak withering damage or one automatic success on a decisive damage roll. When she uses this Charm to enhance a distract gambit, she adds her full (base Guile) in dice on the Initiative roll.
