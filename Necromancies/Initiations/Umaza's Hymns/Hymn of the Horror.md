*Once per scene, when the necromancer sings to [[inspire]] feelings of fear, [[instill]] fear- based ties, or [[threaten]] a character, she rolls ([[Performance]]) with (targetâ€™s unmodified [[Resolve]]) bonus dice, gaining one necromantic mote for each success.*
These last until spent; later uses of this replace these motes, rather than stacking.
