The Sidereal makes the Lesser Sign of the Corpse, shining with a violent radiance that brings stillness to the world. The Sidereal rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Medicine]]). Against undead enemies within medium range, this is a decisive attack rolled against their [[Resolve]]. This has a base damage of ([[Charisma]]) dice of aggravated damage against each hit enemy; the Sidereal divides her [[Initiative]] evenly, rounded up among each damage roll. Zombies and other mindless undead are destroyed instantly, without counting against the Sidereal’s [[Initiative]], as are trivial undead. Undead spirits possessing others are also exorcised from their hosts if the Sidereal’s successes exceed their [[Resolve]]. They can’t attempt to possess that character again for a month. If the damage incapacitates them, they’re rendered permanently incapable of possessing those hosts. The Sidereal may offer a [[Peaceable Conclusion]] to living characters within medium range for free. If any accept, she’s refunded this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost.
