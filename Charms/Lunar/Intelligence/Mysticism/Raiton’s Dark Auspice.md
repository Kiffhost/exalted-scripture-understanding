Even if her wanderings lead to the Underworld, the Lunar shaman’s wisdom is recognized. She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on bargain and persuade rolls targeting ghosts. Ghosts whose corpses the Lunar has provided a proper burial or similar funereal rites recognize her deed; they’re considered to have Major Ties of friendship toward her. Ghosts whose heart’s blood the Lunar took in life also have this [[Intimacy]], though they don’t recognize this fact, feeling an inexplicable affinity for her. If a ghost has reason to oppose the Lunar, this virtual Tie is only Minor. If the Lunar attacks a ghost or threatens one of his Major or Defining Intimacies, he can pay one [[Willpower]] to suppress his [[Intimacy]] toward her for (his [[Integrity]]) days.
