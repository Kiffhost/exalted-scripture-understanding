Executing a lightning-fast kata, the White Reaper bends the arcing nimbus of power around herself into a flickering shield. Flickering Corona Barrier adds +1 to the martial artistâ€™s Parry against an attack. If the martial artist is defending against a battle group, that group does not add its Size to the attack roll. While White Reaper Form is active, the martial artist may expend all her halos to add (halos expended) to her Parry as well. 

## Mastery

The Solar may activate this Charm after her opponent has rolled his attack.
