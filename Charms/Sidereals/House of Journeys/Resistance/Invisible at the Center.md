So long as the Sidereal commits herself to a meek life of toil beneath her station, she is beneath the notice of princes, magistrates, and her superiors. After a few hours or days spent looking for menial work, the Sidereal’s assured to find a job of some kind involving physical labor that will pay just enough for her to eat, clothe herself, and find shelter, but nothing more. Alternatively, she may empower such a job she already has. As long as the Sidereal retains this employment, doesn’t complain, and spends significant time on the job during downtimes, she gains the following benefits: 
-  Once per day, she may waive an Excellency’s cost to reduce the target number of an Athletics or Resistance roll related to her job. 
-  She gains +2 Guile against any rolls that would reveal she’s anything more than an impoverished laborer. 
-  Investigation rolls and tracking rolls against her suffer +1 target number. 
-  Bureaucratic processes involving her falter, taking twice as long as usual to complete. Reset: Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through physical exertion. Harbingers can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
