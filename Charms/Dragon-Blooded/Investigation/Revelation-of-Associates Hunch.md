*Criminals surround themselves with cronies, accomplices, and hirelings like a bonfire wreathes itself in cast-off embers, leaving behind a trail for an intrepid Dragon-Blood to follow.*
She rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10 on an [[Investigation]] roll. If she successfully uncovers evidence of crime, she experiences a sensation of flashing heat. Based on the intensity of this heat, she can gauge roughly how many individuals were involved — a lone offender’s crime barely registers as heat at all, while a conspiracy of hundreds roars like a bonfire. With an [[Investigation]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase of this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can detect that a character is connected to the crime with a successful [[Profile Character]] roll enhanced by [[Revelation-of-Associates Hunch]], recognizing an all-too-familiar heat rising off of the suspect. This doesn’t reveal the role he played in the crime.
