# [[Bear Style]]
Bear style emphasizes grappling, using techniques inspired by its namesake animal that emphasize brute force and unyielding resilience. Once enemies have been caught in the style’s signature hug-like hold, stylists exert pressure on joints or the windpipe to end the fight. Bear style is most prominent in the East, particularly the Northeast, and in parts of the North beyond. It holds especial importance in Iscomay, where it’s studied by janissaries, khojas, and other martial artists — including Moon-Touched princes powerful enough to master the style’s [[Charms]]. 
## Weapons
This style’s unarmed attacks combine punches, open-handed strikes, and headbutts. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced by Bear style [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage. 
## Armor
Bear style is incompatible with armor.
