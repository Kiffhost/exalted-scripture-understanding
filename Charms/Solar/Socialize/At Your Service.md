Upon gazing into her subject’s heart’s desires, the Solar may reflexively transform into an all new persona. The Solar becomes a new character, shaped by the ambitions of her subject. If he needed a pirate captain, she might imbue herself with Sail, Larceny and relevant Intimacies toward anarchy and a love of plunder. The Solar creates this new persona by taking from the traits and Charms of personas created by Heart-Eclipsing Shroud. The persona she devises must have an equal number of traits and Charms as her strongest persona—one which has been enhanced by Draw the Curtain—but may borrow aspects from her true character sheet. If the Solar uses any Larceny Charms to change her appearance at the moment she activates this Charm, her subject is completely incapable of perceiving this change. He may wonder vaguely why that person vanished so suddenly, but will be more concerned with the new figure standing before him, as if they were cut from his dreams to make his wishes come true.
