*The Abyssal sloughs off her anima banner, consigning it to the swirling void of her dark heart.*
The Abyssal can suppress her anima banner, committing two motes for each level of anima. Once this Charm ends, the suppressed levels return to her anima banner, increasing its level. She can stack multiple uses of this Charm, concealing her anima as it builds up.
With [[Essence]] 5, if the Abyssal ends this Charm while she has at least four levels of anima suppressed, she can unleash it in a wave of darkness, visible for miles away, rather than restoring it to her anima banner.
For the rest of the round, characters within long range of her suffer a penalty of (3 + levels of anima expelled) on all [[Awareness]] rolls.
