*The Abyssal wounds the world, revealing the terrible emptiness beyond existence.*
The Abyssal makes a special decisive attack against all characters within short range of a point within her weapon’s range., without needing to aim. The roll is difficulty 1 by default, but the [[Storyteller]] may increase it for especially tricky shots.
If successful, the projectile pierces through reality, a void that draws in everything within close range.
Characters within short range of the projectile must roll ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) or ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) against the Abyssal’s attack roll. Battle groups suffer a −4 penalty.
Those who fail this roll are pulled into close range of the void and fall prone. Affected target suffers (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) dice of decisive damage as the void tears flesh from bone, plus an additional die of damage for each success by which the Abyssal’s roll beats theirs, up to a maximum of the deathknight’s [[Initiative]]. This damage ignores [[Hardness]] and doesn’t reset the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]].
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses [[Sun-Swallowing Voracity]] together with this Charm, it extinguishes all light within medium range of where the projectile falls, as well as those it passes within short range of.
