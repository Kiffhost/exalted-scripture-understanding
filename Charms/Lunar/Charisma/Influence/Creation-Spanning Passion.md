The Lunar forges emotional bonds that transcend all limits and boundaries. She rolls to instill a Tie toward herself in someone she has a Tie toward, the emotional context of which matches or reciprocates her own Tie, adding ([[Intimacy]]) bonus dice. If she’s strengthening an already-existing [[Intimacy]], she doesn’t need another supporting [[Intimacy]] as long as her Tie’s intensity equals or exceeds the level she’s raising the target’s to. While the Lunar and her target each have these Ties at Major or Defining intensity, they glimpse each other in dreams. When they sleep, each player may ask the Storyteller a question about the location, condition, or emotional state of the other player’s character. Players can conceal this information, requiring a successful read intentions roll from the other player to learn it. These dreams cease if the Lunar and the target go more than a month without interacting in the waking world. If the Lunar uses this Charm on her Solar mate, they share dreams regardless of the intensity of their Ties.
