*Wayward Comet Sage walked many esoteric paths — sorcerous austerities, metaphysical engineering, the strange philosophy of the Emerald Gyre.*
But it wasn’t until his last century that he found his greatest talent, artifice. The starmetal nunchaku known as [[Everlasting Descent]] are counted among his early works. They nonetheless evince all the hallmarks of his style, synthesizing the Harbinger’s esoteric disciplines to shape subtle cosmic forces. [[Everlasting Descent]] draws on the potent mysteries of gravity to bind foes and fugitives from justice in an inescapable orbit. For its handles, Wayward Comet Sage dared the time-warping labyrinth of the Thousand Millennium Forest to claim the wood of a tree petrified for epochs untold; for its chains, he bargained with Asna Firstborn for starmetal wire and gravity spun into silk. [[Everlasting Descent]] served the Harbinger well, but he abandoned them three days before his death, entrusting them to fate. Since then, the dragon-tail threshers have found their way into the hands of worthy successors time and again. During the rage of the Flame Scourges, the Jasmine Kestrel Maiden used [[Everlasting Descent]] to juggle meteors, sparing ancient Okeanos from decimation. Eshet Omuzadma bore them into battle against the Paper Legion and scattered its massed ledger-ranks. The [[Lore/Factions/Bureau of Destiny|Bureau of Destiny]]'s quartermasters no longer bother trying to reclaim [[Everlasting Descent]] between wielders. Guided by fate, and perhaps by its maker’s will, it finds its way into the hands of a successor by coincidence and circumstance. It’s often found in humble circumstances — at the bottom of a wood pile, submerged in a bog’s muddy depths, or washed ashore with the driftwood. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Everlasting Descent]]
The strength of Everlasting Descent’s gravitational force depends on its Spin. Spin begins at 0 each scene and can rise up to 5. Their wielder gains one Spin each time she crashes an enemy, deals decisive damage to a nontrivial enemy, or parries a nontrivial enemy’s decisive attack. Upon attuning to [[Everlasting Descent]], its wielder awakens [[Whirling Ecliptic Barrier]] for free.
