*Who can escape the Abyssal’s notice? Her awareness is the inevitability of the grave.*
The Abyssal reduces the cost of [[Shadow-Eating Spirit]] by one mote, and is no longer limited in how many 1s she can penalize the opposing character for.
If the Abyssal has purchased [[Superior (Sense) Focus]] twice, the opposing character’s 2s also subtract successes.
If the Abyssal has all three purchases of [[Superior (Sense) Focus]], the opposing character’s 1s subtract two successes instead of one.
