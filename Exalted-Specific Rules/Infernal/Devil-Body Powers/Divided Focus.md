With the one-dot version of this power, the Infernal rolls an additional Initiative track. This can represent a demonic twin grafted gruesomely onto her body, a living shadow that acts in concert with her, or the like. This has the following effects:
- She can still take only one turn, but can choose which of her Initiative tracks to use at the start of each round.
- When she gains Initiative, she can choose to divide it equally between her tracks, rounded up.
- She can flurry two actions without penalty.

If one of her Initiative tracks is crashed, it is lost, and she loses access to this power.

A two-dot version of this power lets the Infernal roll two additional Initiative tracks, and flurry
three actions without penalty. If she loses one of her three Initiative tracks the power is downgraded to the one dot version, and lost if two are crashed.
