*Huskflayer moves more like a living thing than a weapon, ravening for its gory repast.*
## Dissonant
Characters who are dissonant with [[Huskflayer]] can’t awaken this Evocation.
Huskflayer’s wielder increases the maximum number of gore points she can reap per round to ([[Essence]] + 2).
## Resonant
With [[Essence]] 3, the maximum increases to ([[Essence]] x2).
Awakening: This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience. It awakens for free when a decisive attack with [[Huskflayer]] deals 6+ levels of damage.
