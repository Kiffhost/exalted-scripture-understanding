The second Evocation of Adorei allows the Solar’s attacks to hone in on a target he’s struck with the prerequisite, granting one automatic non-Charm success if the attack roll has at least one 10 in it. However, after using this Charm, the Solar takes a -1 penalty to use any other weapon for the rest of the scene.
