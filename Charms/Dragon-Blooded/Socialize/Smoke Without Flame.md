*Those who expect intemperance or unthinking passion from the Dragon-Blood are the most easily deceived. She gains +1 [[Guile]].*
If the opposing character fails to read her intentions, he believes that he’s succeeded, but what’s revealed to him is an exaggeration of the Dragon-Blood’s emotional state or one of her emotion-based [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], chosen by the player. Irritation might be misread as a hate-filled vendetta; infatuation as passionate longing; or boredom as soul-crushing ennui. In Fire Aura, the [[Guile]] bonus doesn’t count as a bonus from [[Charms]]. With a [[Socialize]] 5, [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, even if the Dragon-Blood’s [[Guile]] is beaten, she may expend her Fire Aura to exaggerate any emotions or emotion-based [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that are revealed.
