*The battlefield or the ballroom — what difference does it make?*
The Abyssal ignores all penalties for flurrying an action with any Ability with a [[Performance]] roll or an action to continue a performance.
She adds ([[Performance]]) dice if it’s a movement action, or an unexpected attack against a dance partner.
