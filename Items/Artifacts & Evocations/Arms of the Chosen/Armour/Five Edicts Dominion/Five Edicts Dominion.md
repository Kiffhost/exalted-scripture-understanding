Legend claims that this hulking black suit of plate armor may be the first soulsteel artifact ever created, dating back to the Divine Revolution. Whether or not it was first, it’s assuredly ancient. [[Five Edicts Dominion]] was forged from the laws of the ancients themselves as they tumbled past the lips of dying titans on the winds of their final breaths. Indistinct shades of long-extinct species shift slowly across its matte-black surface. Wicked spikes protrude from its majestic pauldrons and regal crown-helm. It was worn in battle only once, by the [[Night]] Caste assassin Khour-Rudjek, before he sealed it away under a mountain for thousands of years, fearing what its corrupting influence might do to his fellow Chosen. That mountain lies in a shadowland now, and a mysterious necromancer-king’s dark agents have been seen plumbing the ruins. Over the millennia, the restless dreaming of the Old Laws trapped in the steel has woken something inside. The dying breaths of beings not meant to die are too potent to be silently tamed, and they have formed a consciousness over time. The armor is sentient and can speak to an attuned Exalt even when not worn, or anyone close by when unattuned. What it ultimately wants is anyone’s guess, but canny Exalts are wary of its promises. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Five Edicts Dominion]]

While [[Five Edicts Dominion]] is unattuned, it exerts social influence on any character in long range capable of attuning to it that sees it, making a 10-die bargain roll to convince her to attune to it. Once attuned, [[Five Edicts Dominion]] fills its wearer’s mind with words of those long dead, adding a nonCharm bonus success on [[Occult]] rolls concerning the undead or the Underworld, and on [[Linguistics]] rolls to understand archaic or dead languages.
