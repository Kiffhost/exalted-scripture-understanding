The Solar takes a moment to assess her surroundings in order to determine the most effective channel for violence. Roll (Wits + Brawl) and store the result. The Exalt can reflexively use this result in place of a Brawl roll at any time. Stocked successes can be used to bolster defense at a rate of two successes per Parry or Evasion. These successes fade at the end of the scene. At Essence 4+, the roll gains (Essence) automatic successes. Special Activation Rules: This Charm becomes Reflexive if the Solar beats all of her opponents in a Join Battle roll, or if she knocks an opponent prone.
