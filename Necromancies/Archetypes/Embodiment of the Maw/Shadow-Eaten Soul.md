Faced by the hungering dreams of dead gods, the necromancer consigns her mortal weakness to the Maw. She gains a Minor [[Intimacy|Principle]] of enmity for all life, which cannot be removed or have its context altered by any means. She increases her [[Resolve]] against sorcerous control and [[Charm Keywords#Psyche|Psyche]] effects by +2 as a Charm bonus. At Major intensity, this bonus becomes non-Charm. At Defining intensity, she may treat all Psyche effects as [[unacceptable influence]], but she can no longer voluntarily form positive [[Intimacy|Ties or Principles]] towards the living. Any such Ties she possesses diminish one level at the end of each session.
