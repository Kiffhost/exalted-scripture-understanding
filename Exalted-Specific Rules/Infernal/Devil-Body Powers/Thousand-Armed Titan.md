The Infernal’s reach is wide-ranging and destructive, either through grotesque physical might, emitting waves of disintegrating force, or summoning otherworldly tendrils, or the like. She gains the following benefits:
- She can make close-ranged attacks out to short range.
- Enemies within short range must disengage to move away from her.
- She adds (Essence + [[Strength]]) non-Charm dice on feats of [[Strength]] and adds (Willpower) to her effective [[Strength]] to determine what feats she can accomplish.
- She can complete feats of destruction in a miscellaneous action, even if they would normally take longer.
- If her [[Devil-Body]] has [[Obsidian Exalted/Exalted-Specific Rules/Infernal/Devil-Body Powers/Legendary Size|Legendary Size]], she gains [[Area Attack]] for free.
