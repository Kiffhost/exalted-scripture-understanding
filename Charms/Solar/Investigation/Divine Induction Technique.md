The Lawgiver draws wisdom from the very whispers of Heaven. Once per scene, the Exalt may use a free full Investigation Excellency. This Charm may be reset by succeeding at any Investigation action with a difficulty of (the Solar’s Investigation -1) or greater. Note that this Charm has the mute keyword; the Solar’s insights are never subject to censure, and are never obvious. It is as if she draws her wisdom from the very cosmos.
