The Lunar rouses passions from even the hardest hearts. She resets a failed instill roll to create, strengthen, or weaken an emotion-based [[Intimacy]], or a failed persuade roll that leverages such an [[Intimacy]]. If a target bolsters [[Resolve]] against the renewed influence with the same [[Intimacy]] he used against the original roll, the bonus is reduced by one. This Charm can only be used once per scene. 
## Protean 

In a shape that at least one target has an emotion-based Defining Tie toward, the Lunar gains one [[Willpower]] if the renewed roll succeeds against any such target.
