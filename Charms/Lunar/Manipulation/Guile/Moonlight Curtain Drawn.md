*Vanishing into the depths of herself, the Lunar hides her true face.*
She gains +1 [[Guile]]. If an effect opposing her [[Guile]] would reveal information inconsistent with her current animal or human shape, potentially revealing her as a shapeshifter or impostor, the bonus increases to +3. A [[Manipulation]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase of this Charm extends its duration to Indefinite.
