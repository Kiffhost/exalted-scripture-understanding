*That which the Infernal does not notice can scarcely be said to exist.*

The Infernal is immune to any form of harm or supernatural effect that she isn’t aware of: ambushes, a trap she’s failed to notice, insidious mind-altering magic, and the like. She doesn’t become aware of the threat or even realize that something’s tried to harm her. Her attacker doesn’t lose his concealment against her.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by being hit with a decisive ambush. Attacks negated by this Charm don’t count.
