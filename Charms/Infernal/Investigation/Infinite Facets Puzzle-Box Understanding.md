*The Infernal’s mind expands to encompass all possibilities.*

When the Infernal uses [[Branching Future Foresight]] on an investigation that’s relevant to one of her Major or Defining Intimacies, she can pay a four-mote surcharge to gain access to the following effects:
- **5 points**: Retroactively reveal an expansive intelligence network, equivalent to two-dot Contacts.
- **5 or 7 points**: Use an Awareness, Investigation, Larceny, Stealth, or Survival Charm that’s currently “down” on a relevant action without needing to reset it. This costs seven successes for Charms that can only be used once per story and five successes for other Charms.
- **7 points**: Waive the cost of an Awareness, Investigation, Larceny, Stealth, or Survival Charm with instant duration used on a relevant action.
- **7 points**: Temporarily gain an Awareness, Investigation, Larceny, Stealth, or Survival Charm for [[Branching Future Foresight]]’s duration. The Infernal must meet its prerequisites and can only use it for purposes of her goal.
## [[Keys]]
#### Every Path Foreseen
Instead of limiting [[Branching Future Foresight]] to a single investigation, the Infernal can apply its benefits to all investigations she undertakes that relate to one of her Intimacies. She only needs a Minor Intimacy to gain [[Infinite Facets Puzzle-Box Understanding]]’s benefits. With Essence 5, she no longer requires an Intimacy for either of these benefits.
