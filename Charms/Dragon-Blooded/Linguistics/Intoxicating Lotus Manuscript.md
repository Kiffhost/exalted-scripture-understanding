Tantalizing Dragon’s Tongue The Dragon-Blood creates an enthralling world of story and sensuality to snare a reader, leaving him desperate for another chance to escape into the bliss of her writing. This Charm is a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Linguistics]]) roll with double 9s to compose a piece of poetry, fiction, or other creative narrative tailored to a specific character. If the Terrestrial’s influence roll beats the target’s [[Resolve]], he develops an obsession with her writing as a Minor [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 167). If he goes more than (6 − [[Integrity]]) weeks without reading a new work, he suffers withdrawal symptoms in the form of a −1 penalty on social and mental rolls. When the target spends [[Willpower]] to resist this [[Derangement]], he may also ignore his withdrawal symptom penalty for the same duration. Once he’s spent three [[Willpower]], the influence is broken, and the [[Derangement]] and withdrawal penalty subside. In addition, if the Dragon-Blood goes a full story without writing and releasing a new work that could fulfill the victim’s addiction, it likewise ends. She may make her works difficult or expensive to acquire, but making it impossible for the victim to obtain them negates this Charm. An [[Essence]] 5+ repurchase allows the Dragon-Blood to strengthen the [[Derangement]] with repeated uses of this Charm targeting the same character. Once she uses it against him, she must wait until the next story before she can do so again, raising the intensity of the [[Derangement]] by one step if she succeeds. Each level of intensity above Minor adds +1 to the total [[Willpower]] the victim must spend to break free of this Charm’s influence.
