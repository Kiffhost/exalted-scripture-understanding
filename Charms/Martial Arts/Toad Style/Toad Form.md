A poisonous sheen of Essence spreads across the stylist’s body as she settles into a crouched stance, skin and muscle taking on the toughness of steel.
The stylist gains the following benefits:  - She adds (Resistance) soak.
 - She adds (Essence) dice on rolls against poison and reduces penalties from poisons by (Essence).
 - She gains one Initiative when her soak reduces a withering attack to its minimum damage or her Hardness negates a decisive attack.
 - When an enemy makes physical contact with her by landing an unarmed attack, spending a turn grappling her, etc., she may pay two Initiative to expose him to arrow frog poison. This counts as a counterattack.


## Special activation rules

When the stylist’s soak reduces a withering attack to minimum damage or her Hardness negates a decisive attack, she may reflexively enter Toad Form.
