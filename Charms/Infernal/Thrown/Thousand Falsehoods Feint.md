*The Infernal throws only a single weapon, but sends countless reflections flying through the air.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have Initiative 12+. She makes a decisive attack against up to (Dexterity) enemies, making a single attack roll against them all. However, only one attack is real — the rest are illusory copies. After the attack roll, the Infernal chooses which one was real.

Enemies hit by an illusory weapon are still thrown off balance, suffering (Infernal’s Essence) dice of unsoakable withering damage. The Infernal gains Initiative from this before making the decisive damage roll for the true attack.
