*The crushing weight of the sea whirls between Sea’s Verdict’s forks, sweeping foes to the depths.*
This Evocation can only be used while Sea’s Verdict’s anima is at burning or higher. The wielder makes a withering or decisive smash attack with no [[Defense]] penalty. If it hits a target at close range, all other opponents at close range must roll ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) at a difficulty of (wielder’s [[Essence]] + 2) or be knocked back one range band away from the wielder.
