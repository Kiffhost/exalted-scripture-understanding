*The Dragon-Blood strengthens her patient’s body against the malaise that ravages it.*
She doubles 9s on a roll to treat a disease. If her threshold successes exceed (higher of the disease’s virulence or morbidity), then her ministrations grant her patient a temporary [[Resistance]] specialty in that disease until it has run its course.
A character can only benefit from one such specialty at a time.
