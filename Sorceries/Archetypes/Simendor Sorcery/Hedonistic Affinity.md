The sorcerer exerts subtle charm over her fellow revelers. Anyone who's drunk, drug-impaired, or under a Psyche effect or magical social influence that causes hedonistic pleasure is treated as having a Minor Tie of friendship toward the sorcerer. Spirits associated with alcohol, drugs, or revelry are treated as having a Minor Tie of respect toward her instead.
