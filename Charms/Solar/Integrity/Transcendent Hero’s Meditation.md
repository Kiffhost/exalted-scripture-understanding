*The Solar looks within and beyond the core of her [[Essence]], to the pure white spark of her divinity.*
In doing so, she shatters delusions and sees all things truly. This Charm allows the Solar to break any control effects which grip her !!mind,bodyorsoul.ThisCharmdoesnotallowhertoreverse!! social influence, but rather it combats persuasion that is considered unnatural, hypnotic, or sorcerous. In order to use this Charm, the Solar must first be forced to take an action against one of her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] as a result of the effectâ€™s control. She must then spend at least five minutes meditating on the core of her existence, during which time she sees the blight on her [[Essence]] for what it is. She may then activate this Charm to assert the purity and truth of her inner self, shattering the fell magic and freeing her soul from its grip. This Charm may be used once per story, but !!itisresetaftertheSolarexperiencesLimitBreak.TheExalt!! !!cannotusethisCharmtonoticeorexpungetheGreatCurse.!!
