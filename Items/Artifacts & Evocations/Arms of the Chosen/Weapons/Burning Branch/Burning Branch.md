In the Scarlet Empress’ first bloody war to claim the Threshold, the hero Shirazi Ako, beloved by all, was killed by a Lunar Anathema. Ako’s daughter Atena planted the elder’s signature javelin by her memorial monument. After a century of watering by the tears of mourning family members, loyal troops and lovers, the javelin became the core of something greater — an unbreakable branch that had grown up around the weapon. Several of Ako’s descendants uprooted the branch and forged it into a longfang with many vicious tines and blades extending from its head. They vowed that the weapon would be wielded against the monsters that took Shirazi Ako from the world, and their vow became a spark at its core that flares whenever it weds a hearthstone of fire. Its Evocations are adept at disarming foes and decimating groups. Burning Branch has been passed down from master to apprentice among Immaculate Order shikari. Its last known wielder — Cathak Dimas, of the Sisters of the Dragon’s Claw — has gone missing in the last year. Her fate remains unknown; some speculate that the renowned Anathema hunter has gone renegade, or was finally bested by one of the monsters she hunted. 
 
## Evocations of Burning Branch

While a fire-aspected hearthstone is set in Burning Branch, the wielder may spend one mote to ignite the weapon’s head for a scene, wreathing it in flames that add +1 Overwhelming. A weapon disarmed with the ignited Burning Branch overheats, dealing one die of decisive lethal damage to the first character to touch it during the scene, ignoring Hardness.
