Sometimes a Solar must act quickly to prevent a disastrous incident. When she suspects a character intends to make a social influence roll she disagrees with, the Solar may use this Charm to prevent her target from making a social influence roll. Roll a ([[Manipulation]] + [[Socialize]]) persuade action, adding ([[Essence]]) automatic successes. If the roll succeeds, the target’s intended social action—be it to persuade, bargain, threaten, instill, or read intentions—is treated as if it has already failed and must be reset (p. 223). This Charm is capable of defining influence without employing an [[Intimacy]], but carries no inherent power to lower a target’s [[Resolve]] on its own. This influence costs three [[Willpower]] to resist in a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and requires a Defining [[Intimacy]] to reject. Once a character has been hit with this Charm, if he successfully resets his social action or he pays [[Willpower]] to resist, this Charm can no longer prevent him from attempting the social influence he was initially denied. The Solar may however prevent him from taking other social actions through continued use. All uses of this Charm are reset when a new story begins.
