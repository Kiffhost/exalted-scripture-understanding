The Dragon-Blood’s mind traces countless branching paths of thought, her eyes crackling with brilliant light. This is a special roll to introduce a fact (Exalted, p. 237). Instead of proposing a fact she wishes to introduce, the player names a goal, such as defeating a rival Dynast or investigating corruption within a bureaucracy, and asks the Storyteller to produce the insight she needs with an ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]) roll at difficulty 3. If other characters are concealing or suppressing relevant information, the highest [[Guile]] among them is added to her roll’s difficulty. On a success, the Storyteller introduces a relevant fact that will assist her in achieving her goal, which she experiences as a flash of sudden insight. Threshold successes improve the relevance and specificity of her revelation at the Storyteller’s discretion. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) through the use of a relevant fact that the Dragon-Blood has introduced, either with this Charm or otherwise.
