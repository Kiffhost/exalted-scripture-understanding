The Dragon-Blood’s brush strikes the page like a levinbolt, the only thing swift enough to keep pace with her inspiration. She doubles 7s on a written [[Linguistics]] roll, and dramatically reduces the time needed to complete the work — a long-form work like a book or collection of poetry requires only a day, and anything shorter is finished in seconds. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Defining Principle by authoring, distributing, or defending a written text.
