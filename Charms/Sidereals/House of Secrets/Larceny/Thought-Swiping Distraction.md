*Even one’s innermost thoughts aren’t safe from the deft fingers of a Sidereal thief.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Larceny]]) against the [[Guile]] of a character within short range. Success reveals that character’s current train of thought — harboring suspicions that she’s a spy in his ranks, anticipating the revenge he plans to take on a rival, or ignoring a meeting to pine after his beloved. If the Sidereal’s roll also beat his [[Resolve]], she may steal this thought from him; he forgets what he was thinking about and can’t resume that line of thought for the rest of the scene. If something gives him reason to return to it — e.g., someone else bringing it up in conversation — he my spend one [[Willpower]] to do so.
