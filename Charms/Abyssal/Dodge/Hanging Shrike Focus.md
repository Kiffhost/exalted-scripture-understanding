*The deathknight hangs in the air as if on spectral wings, gazing down on her victims before delivering them to their deaths.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm on her turn to leap up to three range bands straight up, floating in mid-air at the leap’s apex. This uses her movement action. If there are any enemies within close range when she uses this Charm, she must make a disengage roll as part of this action to successfully ascend, adding (Essence) automatic successes.
While airborne, aiming against an enemy who’s below the Abyssal both adds dice on the attack roll and lets her attack at medium range or beyond.
When this Charm ends, the Abyssal descends gently to the ground without taking damage. If the Abyssal ends it prematurely to drop down and makes a nonranged attack on the same turn, it receives the benefits of aiming.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal jumps or ascends beyond close range from the ground with a Charm or other effect, she can use this Charm to hang in mid-air, waiving its Willpower cost.
