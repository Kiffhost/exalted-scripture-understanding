*The martial artist brings the battle to a close with grim solemnity, dispatching foes to their appointed ends.*
The stylist’s attack adds (1 + enemy’s wound penalty) dice of post-soak withering or decisive damage. The damage bonus can’t exceed the stylist’s (Strength).
### Mastery
If a decisive damage roll increases its target’s wound penalty, he suffers additional dice of decisive damage equal to the increase, ignoring Hardness.
These are still subject to the limits above.
