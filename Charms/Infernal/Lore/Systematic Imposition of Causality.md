*The Infernal brings order and stability to chaos, crystallizing the patterns and tents that undergird reality.*

The Infernal radiates a soft white aura of world-ordering Essence out to short range. It has the following effects:
- The aura imposes a −3 penalty on rolls made for Shaping effects or spells unless the Infernal approves of them. (This doesn’t penalize Shape Sorcery rolls.) If a Shaping effect or spell has a difficulty instead of an opposed roll, the difficulty is reduced by two instead.
- The Infernal and other characters within the aura add (Infernal’s Essence/2, rounded up) dice on rolls with Bureaucracy, Investigation, and Lore that are based on pure logic, and on influence rolls based on logical argument.
- The Infernal and all allies within the aura gain +1 Defense and +1 Resolve as a non-Charm bonus against fae and other Wyld phenomena, spells, and Shaping effects.
- Fae treat the aura as an environmental hazard, with difficulty (Infernal’s Intelligence), Damage 1A/round.

With Lore 5, Essence 3, the aura increases to medium range.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she uses [[Mind-Hand Manipulation]].
