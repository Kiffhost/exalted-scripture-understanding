When the Lunar invokes a positive Tie to her Solar mate in a Decision Point, she treats it as a Defining [[Intimacy]]. If it’s already Defining, she needn’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist. This Charm can only be used once per story. The Lunar’s Solar mate can reset it by undergoing significant hardship in the course of upholding a positive Defining Tie toward her. It doesn’t reset until she learns of his efforts.
