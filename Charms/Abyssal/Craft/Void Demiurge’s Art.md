*The Abyssal’s eerie genius demands expression in works worthy of her prowess.*
The deathknight doubles 9s on a Craft roll for a basic or major project.
A Craft 5, Essence 2 repurchase makes this Charm compatible superior projects. The Abyssal may double 8s for a surcharge of one Willpower and one gold point.
A third purchase at Craft 5, Essence 3 makes this Charm compatible with legendary projects. The Abyssal may double 7s for a surcharge of one white point. (She doesn’t need to pay the previous repurchase’s surcharge).
