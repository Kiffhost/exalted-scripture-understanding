*Hellish acid drips from the Infernal's arrow, a corrosive hatred that burns through any armor.*

The Infernal adds +2 to a withering attack's Overwhelming and ignores (higher of Essence or 3) soak. On a decisive attack, she adds one die of damage and ignores (higher of Essence or 3) Hardness. If she has a negative Tie toward her target, she ignores an additional (Intimacy) soak or Hardness.

If the Infernal deals 5+ withering damage or any decisive damage to an enemy wearing armour, the acidic corrosion inflicts a âˆ’1 penalty to his armour's soak and Hardness for the rest of the scene, plus an additional -1 for each 10 on the damage roll. If this inflicts a penalty of -5 or higher on mundane armour, it's destroyed.
### Keys
#### Acid Burst Overflow (Archery 5, Essence 2) (+3m, 1wp)
For a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, if the Infernal deals enough damage to inflict a soak penalty, her arrow bursts to strike all enemies within close range of her target. They suffer dice of damage equal to the amount of the penalty, maximum (Infernal's Essence). It's unsoakable withering damage if the attack was withering, or decisive damage that ignores Hardness on a decisive attack. The Infernal doesn't gain Initiative from this withering damage. An armoured enemy damaged by the splash also suffers the original target's soak and armour penalty, but it's halved, rounded up.
