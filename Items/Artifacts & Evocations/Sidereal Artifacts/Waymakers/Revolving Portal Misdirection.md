The wielder turns her enemies’ numbers against them with deftly positioned portals. When the wielder uses Wandering Gate Deflection, she may pay a three mote, one Willpower surcharge to let her redirect a clashed attack to a second enemy within close range, using her attack roll against his Defense to determine whether it hits but keeping any Charms used on the first attack. Any Initiative a withering attack would grant the attacker goes to the stylist instead. If it was a decisive attack, the attacker loses Initiative for 1s before he resets, but doesn’t subtract them from his damage roll. The redirected attack’s target must use any defensive Charms before the clash is rolled. 

## Resonant

When using this Evocation multiple times in a single round, waive the Willpower cost of uses past the first. 

## Dissonant

The attack can only be redirected to crashed or trivial enemies.
