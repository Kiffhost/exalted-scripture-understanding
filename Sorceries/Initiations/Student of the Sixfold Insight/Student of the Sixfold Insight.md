*The Mandir of Sixfold Insight’s instructors utilize a variety of mind-bending methods to unlock mystical insight. Students employ psychedelics and austerities to break down mental barriers, and study spells trapped in memory crystals or the dreams of imprisoned raksha. By breaking down their minds, they break down the walls that keep them from perceiving the full breadth of sorcerous truth. Students who attend the Mandir leave it with strange tastes and perspectives. They’re exotic, scarred figures who draw the fascination and wariness all sorcerers inspire in [[Prasad]].*
