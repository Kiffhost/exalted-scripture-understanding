*The Sidereal knots a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Drowning Maiden into her shadow; it shimmers with soft scarlet light that ripples throughout the weave of fate, shaping the course of events unless the Sidereal’s foes are willing to face its world-warping force.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Brawl]]) to introduce a fact about a dramatic event or circumstance that’s about to occur in a battle: a sinkhole swallows up fortifications; a traitor makes his move against a general; a sudden thunderstorm devastates an invading armada; an enemy’s reinforcements are delayed by ferocious beasts. She can’t dictate the actions of narratively established characters, but can introduce new characters and dictate their short-term motivation. As usual, the Storyteller may veto facts that contradict established details or would be detrimental to the story, or that are outright impossible; if he does, he should suggest an acceptable alternative. A player may not be able to declare that tyrant lizards start raining from the sky, but could instead have a hungry tyrant lizard appear, drawn to her enemy’s scent. A nontrivial enemy may choose to negate this by taking dice of decisive damage equal to the Sidereal’s successes, ignoring [[Hardness]], as the ripples in fate are grounded through him. If an enemy has fewer undamaged health levels than the dice of damage to be rolled, he can’t opt to interpose himself. If no one does, the Sidereal gains [[Initiative]] equal to her successes and the chosen event comes to pass.
