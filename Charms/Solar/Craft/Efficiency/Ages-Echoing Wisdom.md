The Solar’s return to Creation is a time of expanding her mind and senses. Through her immaculate [[Essence]], she becomes a conduit to the lost magic of a vanished age. Upon the purchase of this Charm, the Exalt gains a number of gold points equal to her permanent major slots. This bonus recurs at the end of each story.
