*Shadows and spite coalesce in the deathknight’s hand as she draws the black blade of her hatred.*
The Abyssal creates an artifact Melee weapon from Essence. The type of weapon created and its exact appearance are the same each time she uses this Charm.
The Abyssal can pay a two-mote surcharge when she uses this Charm to suffuse her weapon with soul-breaking despair. An enemy crashed by a withering attack with it loses a point of Willpower, as do those who take enough decisive damage to increase their wound penalty. Reducing a mortal or Essence 1 ghost to zero Willpower breaks his will; he falls to the ground in the fetal position, unable to act or even defend himself for the rest of the scene as if incapacitated.
This Charm may be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation to the summoned weapon. These Evocations draw their themes and function from the deathknight’s personality, Caste, and iconic anima banner.
