*The martial artist strikes everywhere at once, leaving her victim nowhere to flee.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have [[Initiative]] 15+. She makes undodgeable decisive attacks against an enemy until she misses or has made ([[Essence]] + his wound penalty) attacks. She doesn’t roll damage until she’s finished making attacks; each has a base damage of (enemy’s wound penalty), and she divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among them, rounded up. 
## Terrestrial
The stylist can’t make more than (enemy’s wound penalty + 1) attacks. She rounds down when dividing [[Initiative]] among them.
