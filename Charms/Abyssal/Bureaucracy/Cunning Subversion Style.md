*Mustering the forces of decay and despondency, Death’s Lawgiver consigns her rivals’ aspirations to the grave.*
The Abyssal slows the interval of time necessary to complete a project or bureaucratic task by (Essence) steps: from days to weeks, weeks to months, months to seasons, or seasons to years. This doesn’t slow physical labor, but the project is plagued by misfortune; plans go awry, workers are wracked by paranoia, and dark rumors keep volunteers away. Trivial characters involved in the venture sometimes die under mysterious circumstances, leaving their ghosts to haunt the organization.
The deathknight need not interact directly with the task, nor need she be aware that it’s happening; the ruthless efficiency of her leadership is sufficient to bring ruin to any challenge. She doesn’t learn whether such a task is underway. If there isn’t, this Charm’s curse lingers, falling upon the first such task that begins during its duration.
Up to (Essence) different projects can be simultaneously delayed by stacking this Charm.
