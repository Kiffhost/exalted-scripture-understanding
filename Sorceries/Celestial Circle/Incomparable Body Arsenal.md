*The sorcerer reshapes her body into a clanking metallic form of rust-streaked black iron, mimicking her human appearance but roughly cast, studded with rivets where segments of her metal skin meet.*
While in this form, the sorcerer may reflexively produce any manner of mundane weapons from her body—rusty iron spikes burst from her skin, knives extend from fingertips, an arm lengthens into a broadsword or warhammer, and jagged metal blades fire from her mouth. None of these weapons can be disarmed or destroyed. The spell grants her benefits and drawbacks equivalent to heavy artifact armor (p. 599), while rendering her capable of functioning without air, completely immune to mundane poisons, and unaffected by extremes of temperature, even when they manifest as [[environmental hazards]]. She doubles 9s on all ({Strength or Stamina} + Ability) rolls, and adds one success to all withering and decisive attack rolls. 
In addition, characters with an [[Essence]] pool gain access to the following powers while this spell is active: 
**God-Weapon Armament** (8m; Reflexive; Indefinite; Stackable): When the sorcerer manifests a weapon from her [[Incomparable Body Arsenal]], she may use this Charm to grant it the traits of an artifact weapon. The weapons created with this Charm can take on exotic and overtly magical forms—an artifact [[firewand]] might manifest as a dragon-headed helm that spit fires, while [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Generic Artifact Weapons/Razor Claws|razor claws]] might take the form of foot-long serrated claws extending from the fingers of one hand. Multiple invocations of this Charm can be stacked to create multiple artifact weapons. 
**Metal Behemoth Might** (10m; Supplemental; Instant): When the sorcerer attempts a feat of strength, she may add +2 to her effective [[Strength]] for determining what feats she may attempt. This is not added to her dice pool. 
**Unstoppable Juggernaut Endurance** (5m, 1wp; Simple; Indefinite): The sorcerer may reinforce her vitality with this spell, gaining one -2 health level and two -4 health levels. Damage fills these temporary health levels before the sorcerer’s natural health levels of the same wound penalty, and the levels fade away when filled with damage. This power can only be used once during the spell’s duration. 
## Control Spell
A sorcerer who knows [[Incomparable Body Arsenal]] as her control spell may create and master [[Evocations]] for it, which can only be used while this spell is active. These [[Evocations]] can enhance the armor-nature of this spell, its weapons, or a combination of both. 
## Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
Distorting the [[Incomparable Body Arsenal]] wreaks a terrifying transformation on the opposing sorcerer as the metallic components of his transformed body spike inwards, goring innards and mutilating limbs. This inflicts a crippling comparable to an amputation (chosen by the original caster), as the enemy’s arms are rendered useless by the jagged metal spikes exploding inside them or metal plates weld themselves over his eyes to blind him. Once the spell ends, the distortion’s mutilation is undone along with the usual transformation. The caster may attempt to recover the distorted spell to full functionality by making an extended roll with ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]), with a difficulty of 3, an interval of one action (which cannot be flurried) and a goal number of the total number of cumulative successes achieved on the distortion roll, rounded up. If she succeeds, the distortion is reversed.
