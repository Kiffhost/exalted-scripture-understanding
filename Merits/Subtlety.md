### Prerequisite
Another physically obvious Supernatural Merit, such as claws, quills, or extra limbs.
This Merit may be purchased as many times as desired.
[[Subtlety]] must be attached to another already-purchased Supernatural Merit; it makes that Merit non-obvious to observers when not in use. Examples might include fully retractable claws, extra limbs which fold up into easily-concealed pouches or cavities on the characterâ€™s body, or gills that close up tight enough to be invisible when not in use. The Wyld is rarely kind enough to bestow this Merit on those who feel its touch; it is most commonly granted as a blessing of the Fair Folk to their human servants, though some sorcerers have also studied the art of infusing subtlety into the works of the Wyld.
