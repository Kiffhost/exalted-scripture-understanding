Midnight Thorn’s armored links become as silent and soft as leaves. This Evocation enhances a Stealth roll made while in plant-based concealment, lowering any penalties by the wearer’s (Essence). 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wearer isn’t dissonant with jade, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she successfully ambushes a non-trivial enemy. 

## Resonant

As long as the wearer’s roll beats at least one non-trivial enemy, she gains a point of Initiative.
