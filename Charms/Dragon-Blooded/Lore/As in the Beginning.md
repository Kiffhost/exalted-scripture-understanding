Embodying the creative and destructive power of the Five Elemental Dragons, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a primal force not witnessed since Creation’s birth. Her anima banner flares to bonfire, straining with barely-contained force that mounts over the course of five hours. During this time, the Dragon-Blood can’t take any non-reflexive actions or movement actions. Anyone who can see her anima banner can tell that disaster is imminent; a difficulty 2 ([Intelligence or Perception] + [[Occult]] roll) reveals exactly how much time remains.
The Dragon-Blood’s anima collapses, dispersing harmlessly, if she leaves Aura or is crashed, incapacitated, or forcibly moved by an enemy.
After five hours uninterrupted, the Dragon-Blood expends her Aura and rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]), unleashing a blast that extends (successes/2) miles outwards.
She and her Hearthmates are immune to the blast’s immediate consequences; she can use [[Enfolded in the Dragon’s Wings]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 282) to grant the same protection to all allied characters within medium range. The Storyteller determines how much damage the blast inflicts on mundane scenery and trivial opponents, up to uncountable damage. Affected battle groups must check for rout against difficulty 4. The blast’s other effects depend on its elemental aspect: 
### Air
The sky darkens, pouring down harsh rain or heavy snowfall accompanied by gale-force winds and flashing lightning.
 - Precipitation imposes a –2 penalty on all vision- or hearing-based rolls.
 - Winds impose a –3 penalty on movement actions, ranged attacks, and similar rolls.
 - Airborne characters and trivial opponents treat all movement as difficult terrain.
 - Characters exposed to the storm suffer an environmental hazard with difficulty 2, Damage 10L/hour; a failed roll indicates they’ve been struck by lightning.
The storm lasts (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, but can be dispersed earlier through magic or the creative actions of characters.

### Earth
The land shakes and grinds horrifically as seismic tremors shudder through it.
 - All characters within range must make a difficulty 3 ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) balance roll or fall into a yawning chasm, suffering falling damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232) unless they find a way to mitigate it. Climbing out requires a difficulty 3 ([Dexterity or Strength] + [[Athletics]]) roll, although characters may escape by other means, such as [[Monkey Leap Technique]].
 - The damage wrought by the earthquake renders the entire area difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199), and the speed of any long-range travel through the affected area is halved.

### Fire
A roaring conflagration engulfs the land, setting the world ablaze.
 - All characters suffer a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 6L.
 - Forests, grasslands, wooden structures, and other flammable terrain catches fire and continues to burn with a lesser intensity (difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round) until they’re extinguished or no fuel remains.
 - A haze of smoke and ash hangs over the affected area, imposing a –2 penalty on any vision- or scentbased rolls. This lasts (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, unless dispersed earlier by natural weather, magic, or the creative actions of characters, and may last longer if large regions remain ablaze.

### Water
A swirling pillar of water descends from the sky or rises from the sea, before dispersing in all directions as a crushing tidal wave.
 - Depending on a character’s proximity to the Dragon-Blood, the amount of time they have to prepare for the wave’s impact varies — those within long range are struck by it instantly, without an opportunity to seek cover, while someone miles away from her might have minutes to prepare.
 - Characters unable to reach a place of safety before being hit must make a difficulty 5 ([Strength or Stamina] + [[Athletics]]) roll to avoid being carried away. If they fail, they’re knocked one range band away from the Dragon-Blood per success they failed by. If this movement is interrupted by hitting a barrier, the character takes damage as though he’d suffered a fall from a height equal to the number of range bands of movement prevented.
 - Ships caught in this wave suffer ten dice of [[Hull]] damage. Captains can roll ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]) to avoid the worst of it, subtracting one die of damage per success.
 - The blast is also likely to cause mass flooding in valleys and similar areas.

### Wood
Gigantic vines burst from the ground, bearing vibrant flowers that bloom with toxic pollen.
 - The overgrowth renders the entire area difficult terrain and halves the speed of long-term travel through it, although travelers can potentially bypass this by setting fire to the vines or destroying them through other means.
 - Pollen imposes a –3 penalty on scent-based rolls.
 - The pollen is also an inhaled poison. The first time a character breathes in the affected area, and after each hour of exposure thereafter, they must roll against a poison with Damage 1B/minute, Duration 10 minutes, and a –3 penalty.
The vines remain until destroyed, but their flowers wilt after (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, ending the pollen haze. It can be dispersed earlier by natural weather, magic, or the creative actions of characters.
The Dragon-Blood’s Hearthmates can contribute their Auras to this Charm, as long as they remain within short range and abide the same restrictions she does.
Only one Aura of each element can be contributed, adding a non-Charm die on the [[Lore]] roll and conferring that element’s effects on the blast. The effects of different elements will combine without cancelling one another — Water and Fire, for example, would combine to unleash a scalding tsunami hot enough to set the battlefield afire.
After using this Charm, the Dragon-Blood and all Hearthmates that contributed Auras suffer a –4 fatigue penalty on all rolls. Each full night’s rest lowers the penalty by one; until it’s fully removed, affected characters can’t regain [[Willpower]] from rest.
This Charm can only be used once per story or year, whichever is longer.
