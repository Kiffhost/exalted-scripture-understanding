Early in the First Age, Ranika of the Joybringers forged twin blades for two of her beloved comrades, Ciel Seratta of the Crowned Suns and her bond-partner Leynon Hundred-[[Wings]]. The pair were inseparable as they traveled Creation from pole to pole to establish trade routes with the Wyld and worlds beyond on the Exalted Host’s behalf, and Ranika wished for them to possess arms befitting their unshakable trust in one another. Quenched and tempered beneath the constellation of the Pillar, the astrological sign of partnerships tested and found stable, the blades proved as true as their wielders, withstanding countless threats — the winged serpent plague of Zerit the Devourer; the bestial legion of the Nine Foxfires; the ghostly assassins of the Tower of Dust. When Leynon perished in his time, Ciel was inconsolate, and buried both swords with her dearest friend. The blades remain entombed in a hidden place in the Threshold. Leynon’s ghost stands watch with Courante in his hand, while the terrible hungry ghost that rose from his corpse bears Galliard. Together they await two heroes worthy of the blades. The bones of those who have failed their tests lie scattered around them. The swords — inlaid with a stylized solar eclipse — appear identical in every respect, save that Courante is orichalcum with moonsilver inlay, and Galliard is moonsilver adorned with orichalcum. Destiny will draw them together if they’re separated, that they may be wielded by allies as their nature demands. [[Courante and Galliard]] have the same traits: 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Courante and Galliard]]

Only a pair of companions who treasure each other can draw forth Courante and Galliard’s fullest gifts. When each sword’s wielder has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the other, the other wielder is the Exalt’s sword-sibling. Most of the swords’ [[Evocations]] only function when fighting beside a sword-sibling. The Exalt and her sword-sibling guard each other with intuitive synchrony. As long as the wielder is in close range of her sword-sibling, she gains +1 Parry, and she may ignore a single point of her current onslaught penalty against attacks made by enemies whose [[Initiative]] is lower than her sword-sibling’s. Using the swords’ bond as a bridge, each wielder can touch the other’s awareness. By spending one mote, the Exalt knows if her sword-sibling is wounded or in pain, and can feel any inflamed passions (Exalted, p. 218) or other powerful emotions that have him in their grip. If he dies, she instantly feels a pang of agony and sorrow. Once per story, the wielder may protect her sword-sibling from a decisive attack as long as he is in close range, intercepting the blow meant for him. She suffers the damage of the attack without a chance to interpose her [[Defense]], and must accept a crippling injury (Exalted p. 201). This doesn’t count against the normal once-per-story limit for accepting crippling injuries.
