Nightmare Shard is a weapon of horrific truth, forged to destroy a soul-eating utopia. Drawing upon its legacy, its master can cut through the darkest horrors and the sweetest dreams, freeing those imprisoned within them. She may use this Evocation to cut a Derangement or Psyche effect out of a single character’s mind with a single stroke. He suffers decisive lethal damage equal to the Derangement’s (Intensity x 2) or the (Essence) of the character who used the unnatural influence, ignoring Hardness, unless he successfully defends against the attack. A willing target must still be dealt that much damage, as an unrolled action, to nullify the effect. This Evocation can also be used to nullify unnatural influence used on a large scale, affecting many characters. The wielder’s player should work with the Storyteller to determine what form this endeavor takes, creating a task that’s both commensurate to the severity and scale of the effect and fun to play through at the table. She might need to slay a raksha to free its victims from a plague of visions, deface an enchanted idol to free a town from the sorcerous working imbued into it, or free all of Nexus from a shared dream by entering into it along with her Circlemates to defeat whatever entity created the hallucination. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by spending Willpower to resist any form of unnatural influence that opposes one of the wielder’s Major or Defining Intimacies. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
