*The Abyssal pens a vitriolic critique, freeing her student from foolish beliefs and pointless passions.*
The Abyssal makes an instill roll to weaken an [[Intimacy]], lowering the level of supporting [[Intimacy]] necessary to weaken Major and Defining Intimacies by one (Exalted, p. 215). If she weakens a positive [[Intimacy]], it costs an additional [[Willpower]] to resist for every three extra successes, maximum (higher of Abyssalâ€™s [[Essence]] or 3).
