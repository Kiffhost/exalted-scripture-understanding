The Lawgiver may draw her horse’s tack, armor, and weapons from conceptual Elsewhere, causing them to hover and leap onto her mount’s body over the course of three rounds. She pays one mote for each set of gear—first tack, then barding, then up to three weapons. If the Solar is riding when she activates this Charm, she need not dismount. Her mount’s saddle and armor flows into place, growing beneath her like second skin. She may also pay three motes to instantly send her mount’s panoply Elsewhere. 
At [[Essence]] 4+, she may pay five motes, one [[Willpower]] to instantly clad her mount in the entirety of its gear. [[Whirlwind Horse-Armoring Prana]] is explicitly compatible with the [[Resistance]] Charm [[Glorious Solar Plate]] (p. 378). After using [[Whirlwind Horse-Armoring Prana]], she may use [[Glorious Solar Plate]] reflexively on the same instant to apply the armor’s effects to her steed’s barding for only five motes.
