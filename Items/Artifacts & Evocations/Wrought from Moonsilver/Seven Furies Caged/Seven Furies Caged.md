Such was young Blood Nail’s wrath when he faced the Shogunate’s forces in battle that he went forth heedless of danger, refusing to armor himself against the Wyld Hunt. Thus, his protection fell to his Circlemate and lover, Amareq Winding-Glory, who labored to shape moonsilver around Blood Nail even as he battled. By the time Amareq completedthearmor,itwasstainedwithgore—bothBlood Nail’sandhisvictims’.SevenFuriesCagedhaddrunkdeep of its wearer’s rage, and been born a monster. BloodNail and Seven Furies Caged slaughtered many great foes, whose skulls were hung from the armor’s spikes. The Lunar’s victories saw him recognized as a shahan-ya in the Realm’s infancy, as young Lunars who’d barely survived the Great Contagion and the Fair Folk crusades sought his aid in mastering their rage. He lends the armor freely to students and allies, so long as they use it to further his agenda of open warfare against the Realm. Lunars of other political leanings must trade favors for a chance to bear it into battle. Seven Furies Caged is jagged and bestial in design — some might call it crude, though others remember the difficulty Amareq faced in creating it. Sharp spikes of moonsilver jut from its helm, pauldrons, and gauntlets. Here and there, its plates are discolored where a fragment of jade or splinter of a Dragon-Blood’s bones was caught in the moonsilver while Amareq worked it.
