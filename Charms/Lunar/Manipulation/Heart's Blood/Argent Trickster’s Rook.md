*Flashing a wicked grin as she rolls the dice or turns over her cards, the Lunar claims faces unwisely wagered against her.*
She performs a [[sacred hunt]] by challenging a human to dice, cards, or a similar game of chance, convincing him to stake his shape as his wager. She needn’t convince him that she can actually take his form, and may convince him through vague language, metaphor, or half-truth. Her own wager must be one that her target would consider equal in value to the theft of his shape. If the Lunar wins — including by cheating, as long as she isn’t caught — she concludes the [[sacred hunt]] and claims her target’s form. Her target must be genuinely playing to win. If the Lunar’s target wins or catches her cheating, the [[sacred hunt]] fails, and she can’t take his shape through this Charm until next story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means.
