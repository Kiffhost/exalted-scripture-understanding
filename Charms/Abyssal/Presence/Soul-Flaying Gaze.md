*The cost of defying Death’s Lawgiver forces her enemy to the precipice, then offers her the choice of the velvet gloved hand of aid, or a push into the abyss.*
When the Abyssal uses Killing Word Technique against a single target, she may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to inflict a mind-warping assault. Instead of taking damage to resist, the target must accept a Madness, Obsession, or Paranoia [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 168) at Major Intensity that’s thematically appropriate to the Abyssal’s influence or the Intimacies cited against it. Characters with a Defining [[Intimacy]] opposed to the influence are immune to this, suffering Killing Words Technique’s base effect instead.
