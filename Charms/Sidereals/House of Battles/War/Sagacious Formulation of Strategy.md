*Offering sage counsel in matters of warfare, the Sidereal leads not just armies, but their leaders.*
The Sidereal advises a general as he makes a Strategic Maneuver roll, proposing a different stratagem from the one he selected and making a Strategic Maneuver roll of her own for it. The general can use her roll instead of his if it’s higher, and he can allocate the successes to either of the two stratagems. If he rolls enough successes to meet both stratagem’s thresholds, he can enact them both simultaneously.
If the general uses either the Sidereal’s roll or her stratagem, he gains a Minor Principle once the battle ends — or once he learns of its outcome, if he’s not present personally. This Principle reflects a lesson he’s learned from the battle’s outcome, chosen by the Sidereal. If a Fortifications stratagem turns the tide of battle, he might develop a preference for defensive warfare. If following the Sidereal’s proposed stratagem ends in defeat, he might grow more confident in his own judgment.
