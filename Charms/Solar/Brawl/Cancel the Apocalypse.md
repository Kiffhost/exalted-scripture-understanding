Tearing at an opponent’s anima, the Solar rips away an enemy’s chance for victory. The Exalt can use this Charm upon driving a target into crash, reaching into his soul to rip away at the [[Essence]] suffusing him. This Charm deactivates an ongoing [[Brawl]], [[Martial Arts]], [[Melee]], or combat Attribute Charm of the player’s choosing, but cannot target permanent effects.
