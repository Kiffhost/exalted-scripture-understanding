True masters of the martial arts are able to blend different styles into truly devastating techniques, such as applying [[Armor-Penetrating Fang Strike]] (from Snake style) with [[Striking Fury Claws]] (from Tiger style). This may only be done if using a weapon shared in common (usually unarmed strikes), and the higher of the two [[Martial Arts]] abilities is used for any rolls or [[Defense]] calculations required.
