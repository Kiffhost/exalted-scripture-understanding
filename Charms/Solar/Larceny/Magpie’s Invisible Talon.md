The Exalt moves with imperceptible speed, manipulating Essence flows to steal an object out of reach. This Charm supplements a normal attempt to steal or pickpocket, save that it gives the Solarâ€™s attempt double 9s and allows her to reach an object (Essence) yards away. She may even steal objects behind glass without disturbing the glass through use of this Charm.
