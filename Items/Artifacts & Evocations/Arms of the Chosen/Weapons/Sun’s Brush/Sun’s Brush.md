*Once, the old legends say, the sun shone with a stark white radiance, devoid of wholesome yellow warmth or the many-colored splendor of sunset. They say that Arajati, the many-armed god of art, had fallen in love with the Unconquered Sun, and painted the sun’s rays with the many colors of his brush to woo him. The Sun’s paramour — a figure whose identity changes from telling to telling — killed Arajati for his transgression and sent his brush falling to Creation.
The fallen brush was found by a [[Twilight]] Caste savant and philosopher. Seeking to preserve Arajati’s passion and story, he forged it into a weapon, an orichalcum naginata built around the brush at its core.[[Sun’s Brush]] becomes a teacher to its wielder, guiding her towards wisdom and self-revelation. Its greatest powers are attainable only by those who see the world with a legendary scholar’s insight. [[Sun’s Brush]] is currently guarded by a monastic order of scholars, who tend to one of Creation’s greatest libraries in the frozen depths of a ruined tower built at the dawn of time. It’s said they await the coming of a candidate able to pass their trials of knowledge and cunning to claim the weapon. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Sun’s Brush]]

[[Sun’s Brush]] serves as a writing implement as well as a weapon. It has an illimitable supply of gold ink, and its blade-tip is capable of writing on any surface not warded by nigh-impervious magic. Using [[Sun’s Brush]] to write on an enemy is a difficulty 2 foe-scribing gambit. If the wielder includes social influence in this message, she adds one non-Charm die on her [[Linguistics]] roll for every threshold success on the gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll. These markings can eventually be washed away, but always last at least ([[Essence]]) days.
