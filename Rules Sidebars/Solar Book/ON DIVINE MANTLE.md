[[Divine Mantle|This Charm]] references the greater miracles of a spirit’s office, but those powers aren’t necessarily called out in the text. Treat any god’s most signature powers as their greater miracles. This is particularly true of powers with [[Essence]] minimums that match the spirit’s own permanent [[Essence]] score. If the Solar has been somehow usurped, she can still use the lesser powers of the spirit in question. She should only lose total access to powers allowed by this Charm if she fails to uphold or defend her [[Intimacy|Principle]] in some catastrophic way. [[Divine Mantle]] exists to allow Zeniths in particular to play the role of priest-king, to speak in the name of a god and do workings on that spirit’s behalf. But this Charm is not necessarily contingent on any god’s cooperation. In the case of a Solar defeating a god and taking its power, the Storyteller can choose to activate this Charm without the player’s knowledge, ignoring its cost and allowing the Exalt to suddenly gain access to the powers of the god it has just slain, without question and without missing a beat. A Solar who has defeated a spirit can always gain the effects of this Charm for free and without knowing she’s actually used it—but the Storyteller should never use this as an excuse to take away spirit powers the player enjoys using, or which match the character.
