*The deathknight’s steed transforms into a warped mockery of itself, a horror born from the Neverborn’s nightmares.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses up to six dots of mutations: bony spines, skeletal wings, razor-sharp fangs, or other grotesque transformations.
Using this Charm transforms a mount ridden by the Abyssal, granting it any or all of these mutations. It adds an automatic success on attack rolls and gains +1 [[Defense]].
The Abyssal can purchase this Charm up to([[Essence]] + 1) times. Each repurchase lets her pick an alternative set of mutations she can use with it.
