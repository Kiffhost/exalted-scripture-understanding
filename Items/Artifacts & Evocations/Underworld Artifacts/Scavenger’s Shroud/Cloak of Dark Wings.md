*Mantled in shade and smoke, the Shroud’s wearer becomes as insubstantial as a dying dream.*
When the wearer is attacked while in concealment, she gains +1 Evasion, or +2 in darkness or other sensory obstruction that imposes at least a −3 penalty on [[Awareness]] rolls.
Successfully dodging forces the attacker to make another ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll against the wearer’s [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] successes, subtracting one die from his roll for each successes that his attack missed by.
## Resonant
The penalty on [[Awareness]] rolls subtracts successes, not dice.
