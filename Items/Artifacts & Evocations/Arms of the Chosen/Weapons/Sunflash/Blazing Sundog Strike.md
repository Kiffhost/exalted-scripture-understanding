*The Solar seems to throw two weapons — both [[Sunflash]] and a [[chakram]] of raw anima.*
This Evocation upgrades [[Fiery Solar Chakram]] (Exalted, p. 419). The Solar may expend her anima banner and Sunflash’s as one, combining the total levels expended to determine the Charm’s benefits. Sunflash’s anima banner resets to dim after using this Evocation. Stunts in which Sunflash’s anima banner rises another level count towards the three stunts needed to reset [[Fiery Solar Chakram]].
