When her spirit is becalmed, the Dragon-Blood becomes empty and still. She generates no killing intent, and reflects the killing intent of her enemies back upon them. To use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood’s anima must be at the dim level, and it ends if her anima rises above dim. If an enemy attacks her, she may end this Charm to make a decisive counterattack before the enemy rolls his attack, with a base damage equal to (her attacker’s Initiative/2, rounded up). She isn’t reset to base Initiative by this attack; instead, every success on the damage roll strips one point of Initiative from her attacker, reducing the damage of his own attack, in addition to dealing damage. This counts as the Dragon-Blood’s attack for the round, and cannot be used if she’s already attacked this round. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by using its prerequisite to successfully clash and deal 20+ withering damage while in Water Aura.
