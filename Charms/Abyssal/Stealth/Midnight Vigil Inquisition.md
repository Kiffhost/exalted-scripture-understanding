*Lurking in darkness, the Abyssal bears witness to unspeakable secrets and forbidden shames.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([[Perception]] + {[[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], or [[Socialize]]}) [[Profile Character]] roll. If successful, the [[Storyteller]] reveals whether or not there’s anything advantageous the deathknight might learn from covertly observing him, and approximately how long it might take. For every three extra successes, the Abyssal’s player can ask the [[Storyteller]] a yes-or-no question about the nature of that information.
If the Abyssal uncovers a potential lead, she can commit this Charm’s cost indefinitely to add an automatic success on [[Perception]] rolls and [[Stealth]] rolls against her target. Once her surveillance uncovers a piece of useful information, this Charm ends and she gains one [[Willpower]], to a maximum of one [[Willpower]] per day.
