The wonders born from the Dragon-Blood’s forge desire worthy masters, flourishing in the hands of their maker’s heirs and comrades. Activating this Charm entails a ritual ceremony in which the Dragon-Blood presents an artifact she’s crafted to a blood relative or a Hearthmate.
She awakens up to (recipient’s [[Essence]]) of the artifact’s [[Evocations]] for the recipient at no experience point cost, spending ten white points for each Evocation awakened.
[[Dragon-Ancestor Bequest]] can only be used on any given artifact once.
