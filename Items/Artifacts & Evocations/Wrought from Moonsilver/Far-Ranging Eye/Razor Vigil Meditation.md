Far-Ranging Eye’s attentions are unswerving. The wielder reflexively aims against an enemy toward whom she has a Major or Defining Tie of suspicion or distrust, or who she’s ever witnessed making a surprise attack against her or a character toward whom she has a positive Tie. 

## Resonant

With Essence 3, if both of this Evocation’s conditions are met, the wielder takes two aim actions instead.
