This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired to represent multiple distinct military detachments or truly enormous military forces.
The character is the recognized commander of an organized military force of some sort—generally one composed of ordinary mortal soldiers (traits for an average soldier can be found on p. 496). This Merit’s rating determines how great a force the character commands. For more information on battle groups, see pages 205-211. At two dots, this Merit provides a military force of [[Size]] 3, [[Might]] 0, and Average [[Drill]].
At three dots, this Merit provides either a [[Size]] 3, [[Might]] 0 group with Elite [[Drill]], or a [[Size]] 4-5, [[Might]] 0 group with Average [[Drill]].
At four dots, this Merit provides either a [[Size]] 4-5, [[Might]] 0 Group with Elite [[Drill]], or two [[Size]] 5, [[Might]] 0 groups with Average [[Drill]]. Alternately, it may provide a [[Size]] 3, [[Might]] 0 battle group with Elite [[Drill]] and the traits of elite rather than average troops.
At five dots, this Merit provides either a [[Size]] 5, [[Might]] 0 group with Elite [[Drill]] and the traits of elite rather than average troops, or five [[Size]] 5, might 0 groups with Average [[Drill]], or two [[Size]] 5, [[Might]] 0 groups with Elite [[Drill]].
### Note
Taking the [[Command]] Merit indicates that the soldiers are personally loyal to the Exalt—that they are “her” men, rather than forces belonging to an organization; military forces of that sort are acquired through the [[Backing]] Merit.

#### Lunar
Lunars commonly lead beastfolk armies, which possess [[Might]] 1 (Exalted, p. 207). Such battle groups cost an additional dot.
#### Abyssal
Many Abyssals lead battle groups of zombies or war ghosts (Exalted, pp. 502-504), which possess Might 1. Such battle groups cost an additional dot.
