This ancient art has been passed down by generations of devil-fighting sages who pledged their lives to defend Creation from darkness. Its training regimens combine weapon katas, dance-like footwork, and meditation on light and shadow. Itâ€™s studied by holy ascetics, warriors who guard the borders of shadowlands, and barbarian tribes dwelling in demon-haunted wilderness, as well as Dragon-Blooded shikari.
