*The Dragon-Blood channels Water [[Essence]] into her defense to disperse even the deadliest blows.*
When she uses [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] to block, after the attack is rolled she may pay one mote per 1 in the roll, maximum ([[Essence]]), to reroll that many of the attackerâ€™s successful dice, beginning with 7s and moving up.
