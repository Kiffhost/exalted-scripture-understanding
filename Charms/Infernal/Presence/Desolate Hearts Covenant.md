*The Infernal is a prophet and a saviour to the damned, the answer to their desperate prayers.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after a scene spent interacting with her worshippers or listening to their prayers. She gains a positive Defining Tie to those characters as a group. Her player chooses its context: benevolence, amusement, protectiveness, delight, responsibility, etc.

The Infernal can’t voluntarily weaken the Intimacy. It can’t be fully removed or have its emotional context altered by any means. She adds (Cult/2, rounded up) automatic successes on any Performance, Presence, or Survival rolls that she makes for the benefit of her worshippers.

Once per day, when the Infernal uses [[Temple-Self Apotheosis]] to reduce a mote cost or heal, she can still reduce a Willpower cost as well if she’s acting for the benefit of her worshippers.
