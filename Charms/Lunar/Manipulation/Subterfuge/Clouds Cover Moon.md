*Ushering in darkness, the Lunar blinds her victims to reason.*
She rolls ({Dexterity or Manipulation} + [[Larceny]]), doubling 9s, when she extinguishes a light source, opposing the ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) rolls of anyone who’d notice. Onlookers who fail rationalize this as perfectly normal, attributing it to a gust of wind, shoddy lamp oil, or similar innocuous causes. They won’t relight that light source unless not doing so interferes with whatever duties or activities they’re currently carrying out. This Psyche effect can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]]. If the Lunar extinguishes multiple light sources within close range of one another with a single action, she need only use this Charm once. 
## Totemic 

ALunarwhosespiritshapehasTinyCreature or Minuscule [[Size]] may learn this as a [[Dexterity]] Charm, with [[Thieving Magpie Trick]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
