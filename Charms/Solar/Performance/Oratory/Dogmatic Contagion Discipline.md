The Solar’s arguments and invocations resonate with her audience so profoundly that they’re filled with her fiery passion. When the Solar uses oration to inspire a crowd, she may supplement the roll with this Charm. Extra successes on the roll are passed as bonus dice to those characters who she’s able to successfully influence, for the express purpose of passing on the Solar’s influence. Such characters will retain these bonus dice for (Essence) days. Anyone they are able to successfully influence with the Solar’s arguments gain the same bonus to do so to others, although not the impetus. If this Charm is used with any other that requires an expenditure of Willpower, ignore this Charm’s Willpower cost.
