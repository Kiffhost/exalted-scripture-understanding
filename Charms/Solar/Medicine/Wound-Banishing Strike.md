*The Solar medician may strike at a temporary wound, such as a damaged nerve, a clouded eye, or a blocked meridian in order to instantly heal it.*
In combat, the Solar may counter the temporary crippling effects of certain [[Charms]] and magic such as [[Crippling]] Pressure Point Strike (p. 428) through the use of a difficulty 3 [[Medicine]]-based gambit directed at her patient. The difficulty of the [[Medicine]] “attack” roll is equal to the temporary penalty she wishes to remove; extra successes on this roll add bonus dice to the [[Initiative]] roll of the gambit. In addition, any 10s on the [[Initiative]] roll grant the Solar an equal number of [[Initiative]] if the gambit succeeds. The Exalt performs this treatment instantly and may stunt to forego the use of conventional medical instruments, striking pressure points, dashing out a burn with fresh snow, throwing acupuncture needles and so on. The Lawgiver’s expert touch can smooth the flow of [[Essence]] to realign chakras, push bones back into place, remove minor tears in muscle fibers and so on—so long as the crippling is temporary, the Solar can instantly heal it.
