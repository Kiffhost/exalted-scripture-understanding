When the sorcerer learns of a place she must go to advance a major character or story goal or succeeds on a Survival roll to navigate to such a place, she gains one sorcerous mote, which lasts until the story ends, up to a maximum of 10 sorcerous motes. Once per story, when she upholds an Intimacy by entering such a place for the first time, she gains (Essence x Intimacy) sorcerous motes, which last until she leaves.
