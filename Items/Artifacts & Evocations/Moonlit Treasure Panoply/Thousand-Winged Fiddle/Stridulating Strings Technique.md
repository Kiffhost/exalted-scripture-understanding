Grasshoppers harken to the Thousand-Winged Fiddle’s song, eager to aid its master.
This Evocation upgrades the following Charms (Lunars, pp. 164, 238, 240, 283).
Pack-Calling Cry: The Lunar adds (Essence) nonCharm dice on this Charm’s roll when calling an insect.
Insects called with it add three dice on all rolls they make to fulfill the Lunar’s command. Grasshoppers add three automatic successes instead.
Pack Instinct Affirmation: The Lunar gains the Charm’s Wits 3 benefit with insects regardless of her shape. Ties imposed by the Charm are one level higher for grasshoppers.
Sense-Borrowing Method: The Lunar can share an insect’s senses while playing the fiddle instead of meditating, letting her continue to take Performance GRASSHOPPERS Grasshoppers use beetle traits (Lunars, p. 361).
They have a pool of only three dice for Flight, but have seven dice for Jumping. Battle groups of swarming grasshoppers — also called locusts — inflict a −3 penalty on the movement actions of enemies within close range, and cause those enemies to lose one Initiative at each round’s end. Note that beetles’ withering attacks have Damage 1B against larger enemies actions while seeing through the insect. She waives this Charm’s cost when she uses it on a grasshopper.
Hundred-Eyed Watcher: The Lunar can share Minuscule Size insects’ senses without reducing this Charm’s dice bonus. While sharing grasshoppers’ senses, she converts the bonus dice to automatic successes.
While controlling insects, the bonus is non-Charm.
