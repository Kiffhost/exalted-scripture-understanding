*The deathknight’s grim persistence grinds down even the strongest of wills.*
The Abyssal resets a failed instill, persuade, or threaten roll. If she succeeds on the renewed roll, she gains one [[Willpower]]. A character targeted by her renewed influence can’t bolster his [[Resolve]] with an [[Intimacy]] he used against the original roll, nor can he cite that [[Intimacy]] in a Decision Point.
