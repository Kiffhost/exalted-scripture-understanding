The martial artist seizes hold of her enemy’s joints with a forceful claw strike, digging fingertips or blades into vulnerable connective tissue. Iron Claw Grip can be used after successfully landing a grapple gambit, but before the roll to establish control. If the martial artist successfully gains control of the clinch, then every extra success on the gambit roll adds one round to her control over it, to a maximum of (Essence) bonus rounds. 

## Mastery

Iron Claw Grip doubles 9s on the grapple’s control roll.
