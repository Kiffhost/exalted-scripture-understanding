## Blurring the Boundaries
Deprived of sleep, the sorcerer ceases to distinguish between dreams and waking life. If she goes a day without recovering Willpower from rest, she gains (Essence + her fatigue penalty) sorcerous motes. These motes last until the next time the sorcerer completes the ritual. She can also forgo regaining Willpower when she upholds a Principle in a way that involves self-deprivation or ceaseless rituals or revelry to gain that many sorcerous motes. These last for the rest of the day.
