*The Exalt can plant evidence on a target’s person infallibly.*
The mechanic modeling this Charm is identical to a pickpocketing attempt enhanced by Flawless Pickpocketing Technique—with the same rules for supernatural detection—save that it hides an object on the target’s person. Such an action cannot be noticed for ([[Essence]] × 10) minutes, unless circumstances call attention to it. Trying to hide an anchor in an old man’s rucksack will have undesired effects. In addition, as long as the object remains on the target’s person, the Exalt can reflexively retrieve the item without contest, so long as she is close enough to touch the target. Though the Lawgiver does this with incredible speed, to all onlookers it will be obvious that she lifted the object from the target.
