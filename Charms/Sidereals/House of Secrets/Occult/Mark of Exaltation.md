*The Sidereal’s Caste Mark shines with spiritual light, a symbol of her authority over spirits that illuminates the unseen world.*
The Sidereal can perceive dematerialized characters.
Spirits — both materialized and dematerialized — can see the Sidereal’s Caste Mark as if her anima were at glowing or higher. This display is sufficient for knowledgeable spirits to roll to recognize this Charm’s use.
