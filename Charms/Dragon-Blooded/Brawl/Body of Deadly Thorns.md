As the Dragon-Blood seizes her foe, she draws her anima banner into her body and lets it bloom from her limbs into a hedge of barbed thorns, skewering and impaling her victim. She makes a grapple gambit, doubling 9s on both the attack roll and the control roll. The thorns burrow into her foe’s flesh as she wrestles him, allowing her to combine a restrain action with a decisive savaging attack against him on each round of the clinch. Additionally, the thorns deflect attacks away from her, negating the grappling-induced [[Defense]] penalty to her Parry and granting her bonus soak equal to the successes she rolled on the ([[Strength]] + [[Brawl]]) roll to establish control of the clinch. This counts as soak from armor, and doesn’t stack with any armor she’s wearing. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial foe by landing a decisive savaging attack, slam, or throw against him.
