Clothing herself in unwritten prophecies and uncertain futures, the Lunar confounds the wisdom of seers and augurs. While using Dreams-and-Expectations Stance, she gain the benefits of Fickle Lady’s Shifting Star against all divinations, without needing to use Essential Mirror Nature. Additionally, while using Dreams-and-Expectations Stance, if Fickle Lady’s Shifting Star would interfere with a magical effect, the Lunar may opt to have it provide whatever result the opposing character most desires or expects to see, instead of one consistent with her disguise. That character can recognize such results as false with an ([Intelligence or Perception] + Occult) roll against the Lunar’s total disguise successes; success reveals the true result.
