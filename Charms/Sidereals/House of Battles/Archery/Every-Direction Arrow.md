*The Sidereal looses countless arrows in all directions, only for them to converge upon a single foe from every side.*
The Sidereal makes (lowest of Dexterity, Perception, or Wits) decisive attacks against a single enemy. Each may be either a damaging attack or a distract gambit. For damaging attacks, each has a base damage of (Essence) dice, and the Sidereal divides her Initiative evenly among them, rounded up. She resets to base Initiative after completing all attacks.
For gambits, the Sidereal uses her full Initiative for each roll, paying the cost of each successful gambit after completing all attacks. She must have enough Initiative to pay the cost of each gambit she makes.
The Sidereal need only pay Any-Direction Arrow’s cost once to enhance all attacks. Likewise, magic that only applies to gambits need only be used once to enhance all distract gambits.
