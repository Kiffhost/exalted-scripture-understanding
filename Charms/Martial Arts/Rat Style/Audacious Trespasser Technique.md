Having claimed a delicious morsel, the rat scurries away to enjoy it.
The stylist can use this Charm after dealing 2+ levels of damage with a decisive attack, letting her forgo one level of damage to reflexively disengage from her target.
She doesn’t lose Initiative for doing so. It doesn’t count as her movement action.


## Special activation rules

With Essence 3, the stylist can use Scurrying Rat Retreat reflexively with this Charm to reflexively flurry the disengage roll with a Stealth roll to enter concealment.

## Mastery
The stylist doesn’t need to forgo damage.

## Terrestrial
The stylist doesn’t gain the Essence 3 effect.
