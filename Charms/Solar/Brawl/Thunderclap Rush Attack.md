*The Solar’s aggression fuels her [[Essence]], quickening her movements, allowing her to blur into combat range of an opponent to make a first strike.*
This Charm allows the Solar to move a single range band without consuming her movement action, to make an attack regardless of her position in the [[Initiative]] order. The attack in this instance must be made the moment the Solar blurs forward, and so this Charm can only be activated at short range. This attack counts as her turn for the round, and doesn’t have to be a [[Brawl]] attack. If contested by another character using Thunderclap [[Rush]] [[Attack]], the better stunt wins. The target of Thunderclap [[Rush]] [[Attack]] may not use a [[Clash]] (p. 202) to defend against the Solar’s attack unless he’s using a Charm with the [[Clash]] keyword. At [[Brawl]] 5, [[Essence]] 3+, the character may add one [[Willpower]] to the cost of this Charm—when she uses it against her opponent, it automatically strips ([[Essence]] or 5, whichever is lower) [[Initiative]] from her target and awards it to her, before the attack is made. This Charm can be used once per target, per scene, but can be refreshed against a single target by crashing that target.
