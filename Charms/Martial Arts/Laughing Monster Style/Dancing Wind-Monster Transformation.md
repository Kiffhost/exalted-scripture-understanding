*Locking together a million fingers in a squirming net of self-defeat, the stylist fades from existence, leaving only the sound of her mocking laughter and the enraged bellows of her foes.*
When she uses Laughing Monster Form, she may pay a seven-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to dematerialize, diffusing into a cloud of madness. Allies within short range gain Laughing Monster Form’s benefits, and the stylist can use Reflexive and Supplemental Laughing Monster Charms to benefit their attacks or dodges. The stylist can attack dematerialized characters within short range. She can also attack materialized characters afflicted by Unitary Being Forge within short range. She can use Shuffling the Pieces to snatch imps from enemies within short range and can discharge them through the attacks of allies within short range. However, enemies capable of striking the dematerialized can attack her as though she were one range band closer to them, rending her cloud-body. 
The stylist rematerializes, ending this Charm’s benefits, if there are no nontrivial enemies within short range when her turn ends. To dematerialize again, she must reuse Laughing Monster Form. 
## Terrestrial
The stylist remains vulnerable to materialized enemies’ attacks, but gains +2 Evasion against them if not enhanced by magic capable of striking the dematerialized.
