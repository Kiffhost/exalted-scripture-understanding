Countering a spell as it’s cast is an ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll, with every 2 successes draining 1 sorcerous mote from the spell’s completion. If the sorcerer knows the spell she is attempting to counter, then each success drains 1 mote. This action can only be used against sorcerers within [[Range#Short|short range]].
# Distortion
#Action/sorcery #Action/combat
Once a spell has been cast, its effects cannot be undone, but a skilled sorcerer may mute, twist, or weaken them with a **distort action**. This is an [[Action#Extended|extended]] ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) action, with a difficulty based on the circle of the targeted spell—1 for Terrestrial Circle, 3 for Celestial Circle, and 5 for Solar Circle. 

Not all spells can be distorted. If a spells states that it can be, the [[Action#Extended#Goal Number|goal number]] of the [[distort action]], as well as the precise effects of distortion, are specified in the text of the spell. Other spells, such as those that last only for an instant or that summon a being that exists independently of the spell, cannot be distorted. Distortion has a [[Action#Extended|terminus]] of 5 rolls— if a sorcerer fails to achieve her goal, she cannot attempt to distort the spell again. 

To use a **distort action**, the sorcerer needs to be within [[Range#Short|short range]] of the spell’s target or effect, and must be initiated into that spell’s circle. Attempting to distort a spell that the sorcerer does not know imposes a -2 penalty on all distortion rolls. Distortion is a [[Combat Action]] that cannot be placed in a [[Flurry]].
# Undoing a Spell
Sometimes, a sorcerer may want to completely revoke the effects of a long-term spell. Such feats require a [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Sorcerous Workings|sorcerous working]] of Ambition 3 and the same circle as the spell to be undone. 

#### #advice/storyteller 
The Storyteller may adjust these guidelines to better suit the circumstances or narrative, making it harder or even impossible to dispel an effect if doing so would utterly undermine the functionality of that spell, or making it easier to undo effects that he feels the players should be able to remove more easily.

# Undoing a Sorcerous Working
Sorcerous workings are permanent marvels of magic. Once created, they cannot be countered or distorted. The closest thing to dispelling a working that a rival sorcerer can do is performing a working of her own intended to achieve the opposite effect.  However, while the mechanics of this might equate to the two workings canceling each other out, the Storyteller should keep in mind that both workings are still in place within the world.
<details><summary>Example of opposed workings</summary>
For example, if a Dragon-Blooded sorcerer of the Heptagram has blessed a trade route to speed travel along it, a Solar sorcerer might contest this working with one of her own to slow travel along that route to oppose the Dynast’s working. <br><br>For example, if the Dynast’s working was described as speeding travel by binding the native spirits of the region to tend to the road and provide aid to travelers along it, while the Solar’s was as a curse of fear that panicked any steed brought onto the path and forced an irrational caution on travelers, then the Storyteller might narrate the interaction of these two effects.<br><br> <i>A merchant prince’s horses refuse to set hooves upon the enchanted road, but eventually he finds minor elementals willing to haul his caravan. His heart is struck with worries and anxieties, but spirits whisper soothing reassurances into his dreams. In effect, he is able to complete the journey in the normal time it would take, neither benefitting from the Dragon-Blood’s working nor hindered by the Solar’s, but the effects of both workings make his journey very strange.</i> </details>

Of course, the easiest way to stop a working is to prevent it from being completed. Sabotaging a sorcerer’s [[Sorcerous Workings#Means|Means]] makes it more difficult for her to complete the working, while killing her before it’s complete ensures its failure. 

This will most often come up in the context of players attempting to stop a working being enacted by an enemy sorcerer. Such preemptive measures require realizing that a working is taking place at all. 

Noticing the encroaching effects of a sorcerous working over a region is a difficulty 3 ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll, while discerning the exact effect of the working is difficulty 5. Lower both difficulties by one for characters who are sorcerers themselves, and by an additional one for characters who witness the sorcerer or his subordinates performing the ritual actions needed to enact the working.
