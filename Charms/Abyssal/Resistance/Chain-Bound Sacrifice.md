*Those caught in the Abyssal’s chains make for excellent, if unwilling, bodyguards.*
While grappling an enemy with Chain-and-Armor Mortification, the Abyssal can use him as a shield to clash a decisive attack. She rolls (Stamina + Resistance), doubling 9s and adding automatic successes equal to her rounds of control. If she wins the clash, the attack is redirected to the grappled enemy and automatically hits him.
