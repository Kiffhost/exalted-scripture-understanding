Channeling her anima into a mighty blow against the ground beneath her, the Lunar unleashes a shockwave of devastating spiritual pressure. She rolls a single decisive attack against all characters — friend or foe — within medium range on the same surface as her, rolling ([Initiative/3, rounded up] + attack roll extra successes) damage dice against each. Characters damaged by the attack are knocked one range band away from the Lunar, falling prone. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Trample, the Lunar rolls ([Initiative/2, rounded up] + attack roll extra successes) damage dice.
