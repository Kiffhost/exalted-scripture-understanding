*The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s fierce spirit is undaunted by threats and unmoved by pleas for mercy.*
Against influence that would cause her to refrain from hostilities or impair her ability to fight, she may use this Charm to automatically inspire herself (Exalted, p. 217) with an emotion to bolster her [[Resolve]] against the influence for one scene. If the opposing influence beats her [[Resolve]] and she spends [[Willpower]] to resist, she gains ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] for each [[Willpower]] point she spends.
