*Understanding the cycles of Essence that flow through both the living and the dead, the Abyssal siphons away another’s power.*
The Abyssal steals up to (Essence x3) motes from a willing or helpless character with a touch. Once per scene, she may roll (Wits + Lore) when she uses this Charm, stealing an additional mote for each success.
With a Lore 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can instead transfer up to (Essence x3) of her motes to a character.
If she rolls (Wits + Lore), he gains additional motes equal to her successes, which she doesn’t lose.
A third purchase at Lore 4, Essence 2 lets the Abyssal use this Charm reflexively on her turn and lets her waive its cost the first time she uses it in a scene. When she rolls for extra motes, she rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10.
