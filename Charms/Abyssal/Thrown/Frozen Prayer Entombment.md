*The deathknight infuses her weapons with a terrible cold that gradually freezes her victims in place.*
If the Abyssal deals 3+ decisive damage, her enemy suffers a −3 crippling penalty from the cold. This lasts until at least the end of the scene; after that, she must receive adequate medical treatment for hypothermia or rest until he’s healed all damage in his health track to remove the penalty.
Multiple uses of this Charm stack their penalties.
