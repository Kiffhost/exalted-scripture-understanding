*The Dragon-Blood can split stone with her bare hands, delivering a series of precise strikes that carve it from within, shaping it to her will.*
She may undertake a basic or major project to craft stone or earth (but not metal) without needing tools or a workshop. If she uses tools to assist the project, such as striking a boulder with a chisel, she multiplies the rate at which she works by ([[Essence]] + 1), reducing the time to complete the project to a minimum of one minute.
