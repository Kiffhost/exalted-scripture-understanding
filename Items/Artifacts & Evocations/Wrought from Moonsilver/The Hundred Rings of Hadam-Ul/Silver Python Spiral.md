*The Hundred Rings build an awful momentum as their wielder spins her grappled foe in circles, mounting to a deadly finish as she looses him.*
Her decisive throw adds (wielderâ€™s rounds of control) attack roll extra successes as dice of damage, and can fling enemies one range band away, maximum long. 

## Resonant

With a throw that deals 5+ damage, the wielder can fling her foe two range bands away.
