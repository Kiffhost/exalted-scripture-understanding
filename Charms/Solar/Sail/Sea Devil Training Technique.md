Once, the nations of the sea rose up to drive the Chosen from the world as the Exalted had driven the gods’ masters before them. The Solars answered this piracy by training a host of marine-warriors to sweep the Niobrarans back across the sea. Through the use of this Charm, even the most degenerate blackguards can be trained into an elite crew. This Charm is an enhanced training regimen. The Solar’s methods are brutal, harsh, and yet inspiring, teaching her initiates fear and respect in equal measures and strengthening them against the hardships to come. With this Charm, she can invest her crew with one of the following skills after a training period of one month: •Sail 4. •Soldier-level combat prowess described on pgs. 496-497 •	 Two Integrity specialties: one to resist supernatural horror, the other to resist hypnotic magic. •	 Larceny, Resistance, or Survival up to the Solar’s rating -1. •Willpower 6.
