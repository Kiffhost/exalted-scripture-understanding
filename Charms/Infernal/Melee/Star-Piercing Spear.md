*The Infernal draws forth her hellish weapon, coalescing it from emerald flame and hateful radiance.*

The Infernal creates an artifact Melee weapon from Essence. The type of weapon created and its exact appearance are the same each time she uses this Charm. When she uses [[Green Sun Nimbus Flare]] on an attack with the weapon, its total mote cost is reduced by (Essence/2, rounded up).
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively upon entering [[Devil-Body]], waiving its mote cost. If it has an [[Enhanced Attack]] with Melee weapon traits (p. XX), she can merge the weapon with it, using the better of their traits.
