*Fate is not a cage except for those who fear it. The Infernal is not counted among their number.*

When a character attempts to scry on the Infernal or predict her future, she becomes aware of this attempt and can activate this Charm. She rolls (Wits + Larceny) with double 9s against the opposing character’s Guile to discern his identity. If she succeeds, she can also dictate the result of his prophecy or scrying. While this is most often used to evade such seers’ notice, some Infernals prefer to taunt or terrify them.

Alternatively, this Charm can negate magic that guarantees some outcome will come to pass, like [[God-King’s Shrike (Dogstar Ruminations)|God-King's Shrike]] (Exalted, p. 340). If such an effect would harm or impede the Infernal or one of her Intimacies, she becomes aware of the effect and the identity of the character responsible without needing to roll. She can then negate that effect by winning a notable victory over him or by implementing some scheme that the Storyteller agrees could thwart his prophesying.
