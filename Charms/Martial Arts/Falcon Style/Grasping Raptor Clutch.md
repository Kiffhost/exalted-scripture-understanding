*Grabbing her foe like a diving falcon gripping its prey, the stylist forces him into a painful hold, stretching his muscles and spine past what they can bear.* 
While grappling an enemy, she can use her turn to take a restrain or drag action and then make a decisive savaging attack, throw, or slam against her foe. If this incapacitates him, she gains three [[Initiative]].
