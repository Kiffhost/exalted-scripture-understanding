*Those who survive the Infernal’s cruelty feebly limp away, unable to forget the venomous agony that scars their memories.*

If the Infernal deals 3+ levels of damage with a decisive attack, her target suffers a poison with Damage 1L/round, Duration (Essence + levels of damage dealt) rounds, and a −3 penalty. Each 10 on the attack’s damage roll increases the poison’s damage by one, maximum (higher of Essence or 3).

Thrown Charms that gain benefits from enemies’ wound penalties also benefit from the poison’s penalty, using whichever of the two is highest.
