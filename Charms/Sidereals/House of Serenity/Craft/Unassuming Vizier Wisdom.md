Insinuating herself among temporal powers, the Sidereal weaves herself into his dominion as its guardian. After giving a gift or making a show of obeisance to a community’s leader in a way that aligns with one of his Major or Defining Intimacies, the Sidereal lashes the community’s fate to her own: 
-  If she supports the community’s leader, he gains −1 target number on Bureaucracy, Lore, and Socialize rolls related to projects or other bureaucratic tasks initiated for the community’s benefit. 
-  She can make read intentions, profile character, and diagnosis rolls against the community as a whole with (Perception + Craft) after a scene spent interacting with community members. This lets her discern common Intimacies among the community, map out relationships within the community, detect epidemics, etc. If someone’s actively concealing the sought information, she must also beat his Guile. 
-  She can use Wife-Procuring Tailfeathers (p. XX) to secure a position of prominence in the organization, rather than a marriage. Its benefits apply for that organization as usual. Members apply their Intimacies toward the organization to the Sidereal, rather than their Ties to her spouse. 
-  If she knows Cosmos-Sustaining Demiurge, community members and their property within (Essence x10) miles of her are immune to Wyld exposure (p. XX).
