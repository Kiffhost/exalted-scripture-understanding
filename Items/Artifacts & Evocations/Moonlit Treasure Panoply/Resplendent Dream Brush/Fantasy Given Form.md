The Resplendent Dream Brush’s art blurs the lines between fantasy and reality.
The artist invokes an [[Intimacy]] to begin a [[Craft]] (Painting) project to create any mundane object, adding ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice on all rolls. No other tools or raw materials are needed — the artist simply paints the object into being. It’s always exceptional (Exalted, p. 580). The created object’s appearance or design always reflects or expresses the invoked [[Intimacy]] in some way.
Any [[Intimacy]] can be invoked for a basic project, but major projects require at least a Major [[Intimacy]]. The level of [[Intimacy]] required increases by one if the object is larger than personal scale, has a complicated design, or is made of rare materials.
Once per scene, the painter may waive the cost of a Charm that accelerates a project with this Evocation, like [[Pattern-Realizing Genius]] (Lunars, p. 211).
## Resonant
If the painter uses magic to accelerate the project, she completes it instantly.
