The Sidereal need not keep precise track of her faithful steed, twining the strand of its fate together with hers to ensure it’s there when she has need of it. To use this Charm, the Sidereal must have dismounted and her mount must be somewhere it can’t be perceived by any character. Her mount disappears. She can find it by going to any stable or other place where horses are kept (regardless of whether her mount is a horse), discovering it serendipitously waiting for her. If there’s no time to find a stable, the Sidereal can use this Charm for ten motes and one [[Willpower]] to have fate instantly return her mount to her. It runs to her, and she can reflexively mount it as a movement action.
