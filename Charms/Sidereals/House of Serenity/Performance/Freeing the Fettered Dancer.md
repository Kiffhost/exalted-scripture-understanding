In failure, there is freedom, even from the baleful powers of the mind-warping magic and the world’s foes. When the Sidereal observes a character fail a roll or suffer a setback, she rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) to free him from a Psyche effect, Shaping effect, or sorcerous curse. The roll’s difficulty is the ([[Essence]] + 3) of the character who used that effect.
