*The Sidereal’s words and actions brighten the lives of those around her, subtly shaping events into the pattern of a joyful life.*
The Sidereal rolls ({Appearance or Charisma} + Performance) to inspire hope, doing so not through a conventional performance, but by spending a few minutes spent interacting with her targets. The Sidereal doesn’t suffer multiple target penalties, isn’t impeded by language barriers, and can’t be perceived as this influence’s source.
If successful, the Sidereal can transfer up to (higher of Essence or 3) of her Willpower to characters affected by this influence, although she can’t grant any single character more than one Willpower.
With a Performance 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can make this influence roll instantly, and can transfer multiple Willpower to the same target.
