*The Abyssal’s discerning focus unravels the labyrinth of social interactions, intuiting infinite nuances from the slightest hint.*
The Abyssal rolls read intentions with (Essence) automatic successes against all characters she can perceive.
Success reveals a character’s current emotional state, any Ties he has to others in the scene, and his current intentions toward others in the scene.
Failing to read a character’s intentions with this Charm doesn’t require the Abyssal to reset her read intentions before she can attempt it against him again in the same scene.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by a significant change to the scene’s context.
