*Binding her borrowed faces to the Shifter’s Skin, the Lunar effects a more lasting deception Life of the Hummingbird’s duration becomes one day.*
It receives this artifact’s cost discount. The Lunar can pay one [[Willpower]] to imprint a borrowed shape on the armor, extending its duration to indefinite and letting her leave the shape without ending [[Life of the Hummingbird]]. She can imprint up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) shapes.
If the Lunar has Life of the Hummingbird’s repurchase, she can use it whenever she fulfills the condition of a Charm that grants a new kind of [[Sacred Hunt]], but didn’t declare a [[Sacred Hunt]] in advance or doesn’t qualify to take the shape for some other reason (like being caught cheating when using [[Argent Trickster’s Rook]]).
