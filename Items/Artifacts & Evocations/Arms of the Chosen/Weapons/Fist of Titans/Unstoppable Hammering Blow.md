*Fist of Titans recognizes its wielder’s might, exulting in her destructive power.*
It gains +1 [[Accuracy]] on all smash attacks, and the [[Defense]] penalty for making one is waived. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with jade, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she defeats a significant enemy with a smash attack.
