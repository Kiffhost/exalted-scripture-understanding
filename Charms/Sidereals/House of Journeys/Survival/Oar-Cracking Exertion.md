Straining against the limits of her strength, the Sidereal fulfills her duty to the world no matter the cost. The Sidereal can use this Charm against an obstacle to a task that supports a Defining Intimacy or that would make material progress toward a major character or story goal. She may waive the cost of up to three Charms or other effects she uses against the obstacle. Effects with ongoing durations end once the scene does. The Sidereal can also reset Charms to use against the obstacle; these also count toward the three-Charm limit. She can’t use these with Charms that create, enhance, or defend against attacks. If the Sidereal’s task supports a Defining Principle of duty, she waives this Charm’s health level cost. Reset: Once per day unless reset by upholding the Intimacy the task aligned with or fulfilling the goal it advanced. Harbingers can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
