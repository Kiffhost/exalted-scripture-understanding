*The necromancer channels the heat of a thousand decaying dead into the ground, burning a brand into the earth to call forth countless grasping skeletal hands.*
The area out to medium range around the necromancer becomes a field of grasping skeletal hands, treated as difficult terrain for all but the necromancer and her allies. The field is an environmental hazard with difficulty ([[Intelligence]]), Damage 1B/round. Damaged enemies fall prone. The difficulty to rise from prone increases by (1 + target’s wound penalty) as the frenzied hands tear at him. The grasping hands disappear at the scene’s end, leaving only churned earth behind.
## Control
The necromancer may extend the spell’s duration from one scene to until the next sunrise. She may delay the appearance of the field after the spell has been cast. She can prepare it to capture her enemies beforehand, luring them into it before activating the spell. Wherever the sorcerer has prepared the spell, a brand shaped like her hand appears burned into the earth. Additionally, skeletal hands occasionally emerge from nearby surfaces or from within her attire to serve the necromancer.
## Distortion (10)
Distortion weakens the spell’s grip, allowing the distorting necromancer to ignore the difficult terrain. Anyone restrained by the spell is freed upon successful distortion.
