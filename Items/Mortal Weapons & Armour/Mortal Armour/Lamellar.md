Lamellar armor is a [[Items/Mortal Weapons & Armour/Mortal Armour/Breastplate|breastplate]] composed of a series of interlocking horizontal bands. [[Lamellar]] is lighter and more flexible than a standard [[Items/Mortal Weapons & Armour/Mortal Armour/Breastplate|breastplate]] and allows better air circulation. [[Lamellar]] armor is assumed to include greaves to protect the wearer’s lower legs, a skirt to protect his upper legs and bracers to protect his wrists and arms.
