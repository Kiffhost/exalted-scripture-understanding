Just as a rising tide transforms landscapes, the Terrestrial’s words can turn fear to hope or delight to sorrow. She makes an inspire roll with (Manipulation + Presence) against a single character who’s in the grip of strong emotion, either as a result of an inspire action (Exalted, p. 217), or due to roleplaying reasons. Success lets the Dragon-Blood change her target’s emotion to another, unrelated passion. The new emotion is treated as a Major Intimacy even if the original wasn’t inspired using influence. A character must enter a Decision Point and call on a Major or Defining Intimacy to resist this influence with Willpower.
