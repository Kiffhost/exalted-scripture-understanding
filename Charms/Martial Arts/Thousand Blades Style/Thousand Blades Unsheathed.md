*Bound to her weapons by will and Essence, the stylist need not grasp their hilt to wield them.*
The stylist may wield her signature weapons with will alone, causing them to float at her side and move as she directs. This has the following benefits: 
- Fighting with multiple signature weapons uses the rules for dual wielding (Exalted, p. 586).
- Crippling effects that target her limbs, off-hand penalties, and the like don’t apply while wielding weapons this way.
- She can still be disarmed, which knocks her weapons from the air, but the disarm gambit suffers +1 difficulty. She can retrieve fallen weapons with a ready weapon action.
- When the stylist attunes multiple of her signature weapon, weapons past the first reduce their cost to one mote. Once she’s attuned five weapons, further attunements are free.
## Special activation rules
Charms that create a signature weapon, like Glorious Solar Saber, also receive this Charm’s attunement discount. As long as the stylist has attuned another signature weapon, such Charms also waive their Willpower cost and can be used reflexively.
