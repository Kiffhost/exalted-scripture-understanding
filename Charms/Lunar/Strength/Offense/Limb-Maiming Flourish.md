*The Lunar gouges eyes from sockets and rips limbs in twain with awful strength.*
To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 10+. If an enemy damaged by her decisive attack doesn’t accept the highest level of crippling injury possible (Exalted, p. 201), she rolls an additional die of decisive damage for each die on the original damage roll that showed a success. If her enemy takes a crippling injury, it doesn’t count against the once-per-story limit on doing so, and he’s immune to this Charm for the scene. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with crippling attacks, the Lunar gains one [[Willpower]] if her attack incapacitates a nontrivial foe or inflicts a crippling injury.
