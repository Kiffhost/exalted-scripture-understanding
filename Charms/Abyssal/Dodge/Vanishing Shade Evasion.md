*The deathknight finds every flaw in a foe’s attack, spurning their imperfect violence.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after an attack roll against her, causing her attacker’s 1s to subtract successes for three motes each. If she successfully dodges, she can reflexively roll [[Stealth]] to establish concealment if she’s in a suitable hiding spot, adding her opponent’s lost successes on her roll.
