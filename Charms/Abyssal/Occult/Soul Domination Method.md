*Casting her spirit outward, Death’s Lawgiver invades another’s soul, sifting through his mind and warping his spirit to her will.*
The Abyssal invades the mindscape of a willing, unconscious, or restrained target, allowing her to interact with his mind or soul. This can’t be used to influence others — it’s limited to observation, healing or mitigating maladies, and esoteric interactions that aren’t otherwise possible. The Abyssal rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) against a difficulty or opposing roll appropriate to the specific effect.
Examples include:
 - Roll against a target’s [[Guile]] to sift through his memories, seeking a specific piece of information or to look for signs of spiritual or mental maladies, like possession. She may suffer a penalty if the memories she seeks out are old or somehow obscured. She can make [[Perception]]-based rolls and use [[Charms]] to examine these memories for information her target missed.
 - Weaken or subvert the control exerted by a Psyche effect, rolling against an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll by the character responsible. The Abyssal’s player should work out the specifics with the [[Storyteller]], but they should involve altering how it affects the target, rather than reducing [[Willpower]] costs, mitigating penalties, or other mechanical effects.
 - Roll against a Fair Folk’s [[Resolve]] to enter its spiritual maw and wrest free the shards of someone’s psyche that it’s devoured. A subsequent use of this Charm can return them to that character, rolling against a difficulty based on how it’s been since the raksha fed on him.
 - Unleash a possessing entity devoured with [[Divinity-Banishing Contempt]] to take control of the target.
