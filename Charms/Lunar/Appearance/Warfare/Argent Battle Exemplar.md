The Lunar leads the charge, her divine might and boundless courage a beacon to her forces. After landing an attack, she may spend any number of attack roll extra successes to reflexively order a battle group to attack the same enemy on its next turn, using the expended extra successes instead of rolling. Spent extra successes aren’t added to withering damage rolls or available for other effects. This Charm’s cost is waived if used after attacking a battle group.
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a Strength Charm.
