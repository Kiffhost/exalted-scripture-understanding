The Dragon-Blood’s body dissolves into an untouchable blaze, incinerating those who dare strike her. When she uses [[Hopping Firecracker Evasion]] to leap away from an enemy at close range, she makes an unblockable decisive counterattack with the flames of her leap, rolling ([[Wits]] + [[Dodge]]). The counterattack deals ([Essence + base [[Defense|Evasion]]]/2, rounded up)L damage dice, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t include her [[Initiative]] or reset her to base [[Initiative]]. An enemy that takes 3+ levels of damage from the counterattack is set ablaze, suffering ([[Essence]]) dice of lethal damage each turn until he extinguishes himself.
