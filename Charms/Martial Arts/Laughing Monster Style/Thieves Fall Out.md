The stylist’s wicked cunning tangles the bonds of friendship into a tripwire. She rolls one decisive attack against two enemies within close range of each other, dividing her Initiative evenly between them, rounded up, to determine the damage rolled. If she hits both, she disrupts their rhythm, causing them to stumble over each other. For the rest of the scene, while they’re within close range of each other, both suffer −1 Defense, and each loses one Initiative at the start of each of his turns, which the stylist gains. This Charm can instead be used to attack a battle group, doubling its effective damage dice to determine how many extra levels of damage it inflicts (Exalted, p. 208). A hit battle group suffers the above penalties for the scene but loses Magnitude instead of Initiative (which doesn’t grant the stylist Initiative).
