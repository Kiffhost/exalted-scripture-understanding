[[The Red Rule]] (p. 222) states that no matter the magic, no matter the circumstances, no player character can ever be seduced if the player disagrees. Although not every sexualized mechanic in the game is a seduction attempt, whenever you come across such an effect, use the spirit of the Red Rule rather than the letter. Respect your fellow players first and foremost.
