Dexterity is grace, agility, and coordination. In combat, Dexterity determines both the accuracy of a character’s [[Attack#hit roll|attacks]] and his faculty to [[Defense|defend]] against enemy attacks, as well as being used for movement that relies on swift or nimble maneuvering across terrain. It’s also used for actions that require precise control of physical motions, such as hiding from a patrolling sentry or picking a merchant prince’s pocket.
