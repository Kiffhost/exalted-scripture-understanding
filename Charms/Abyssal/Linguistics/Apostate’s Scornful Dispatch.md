*The Abyssal pens a vitriolic critique, freeing her student from foolish beliefs and pointless passions.*
The Abyssal makes an instill roll to weaken an Intimacy, lowering the level of supporting Intimacy necessary to weaken Major and Defining Intimacies by one (Exalted, p. 215). If she weakens a positive Intimacy, it costs an additional Willpower to resist for every three extra successes, maximum (higher of Abyssal’s Essence or 3).
