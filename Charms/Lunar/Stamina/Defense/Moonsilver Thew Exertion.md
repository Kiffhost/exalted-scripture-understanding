The Lunar amplifies her body’s mass as she wrestles a foe, becoming too heavy to be taken down or pinning a foe beneath tremendous weight. She rerolls (Stamina) failed dice on a grapple control roll or a roll opposing an enemy’s control roll. Such is her mass that she can oppose the grapples of Legendary Size enemies (but not clinch them). This Charm carries the same consequences for increasing mass as its prerequisite.
