*This Charm demonstrates the skill of a Lawgiver to steal the very weapon from her foe’s hand.*
When used, this Charm alters a disarm gambit (see p. 199) in the following ways:
- The cost of the gambit is replaced by the cost of the Charm. 
- The gambit is considered a reflexive action rather than a combat action, leaving the Exalt free to attack in addition to disarming. Doing so carries no [[Defense]] penalty. 
- The Lawgiver’s [[Initiative]] roll gains double 9s. 

On a success, the Exalt steals her target’s weapon. If the stolen weapon is an artifact, it breaks the target’s attunement and allows the Exalt to commit motes to instantly attune the weapon. If the Exalt cannot or will not pay these motes, the weapon is merely cast aside as if it were disarmed normally. A Solar who uses whips, lassos, rope darts or other prehensile weaponry may use this Charm at the range of her weapon.
