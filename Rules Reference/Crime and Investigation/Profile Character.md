The profile character action can be used to read people, examining them for any clues in their posture, demeanor, or appearance. After spending at least five minutes interacting with or observing the person he wishes to profile, the character’s player rolls (Perception + Investigation) against her Guile . On a success, the Storyteller should give the player a brief rundown of basic facts about the character that aren’t immediately obvious—social class, occupation, where he was an hour ago, or similar. This isn’t mind reading or magical divination, but it will allow a character to get a basic idea of what someone does, and possibly notice some incongruous details.

The profile character action can also be used to look for clues, as described in the case scene action. As long as the character is observing someone involved in the mystery or crime he is pursuing, a successful roll will give him a clue that will advance his investigation.
