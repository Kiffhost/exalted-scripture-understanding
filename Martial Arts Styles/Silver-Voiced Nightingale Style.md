# [[Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style]]
Silver-Voiced Nightingale style is an esoteric art, focusing on the use of the stylist’s voice in both song and warfare. Through rigorous training in breath control, circular breathing, and long, sustained chants, students of this style learn to fight with kiais, powerful shouts with the strength to kill. They are also consummate performers, singing on the battlefield to strengthen the morale of their allies and shatter that of their enemies. While the style’s appellation honors the eponymous martial artist who created it in the distant past, the full title is only remembered by those of the Exalted with memories of past lives in the First Age, or who lived through it themselves. In most dojos across Creation, it is known only as Nightingale style.
## Weapons
Nightingale style attacks are made unarmed, each strike accompanied by a powerful shout. For [[Essence]]-users, the style is unique in not relying upon either weapons or unarmed strikes—instead, its practitioners learn to deliver powerful kiai attacks through the force of their voice alone, enabled through mastering the first Charm of this style.
## Armour
Silver-Voiced Nightingale style is compatible with light armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Performance]] is essential to Nightingale stylists, as many of the style’s [[Charms]] revolve around using it to take social actions in battle.

# Remix
Silver-Voiced Nightingale style, as written, assumes that its stylists must sing to use its [[Charms]]. However, over the ages, offshoot branches and deviant schools of this style have developed that use other forms of musical performance. If you want to fight as a sanxian player who draws razor-sharp winds forth with each pluck of the strings, a flute-player whose scales burst eardrums and shatter bones, or a freestyle poet whose rhymes sear themselves into the skin of his enemies as characters writ in fire—go for it!
