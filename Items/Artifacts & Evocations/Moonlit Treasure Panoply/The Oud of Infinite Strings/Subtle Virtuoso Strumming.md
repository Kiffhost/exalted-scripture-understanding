The Lunar musician works wonders with the oud’s moonsilver strings.
This Evocation upgrades the following Charms (Lunars, pp. 145-146, 219, 231).
Glance-Oration Technique: The Lunar can convey complex meaning through the oud’s music.
Many-Voiced Mockingbird Attitude: The Lunar can mimic the sounds of other instruments on the oud.
Subtle Speech Method: The Lunar can convey hidden messages through the oud’s music. This doesn’t circumvent the Resolve bonus targets receive if she doesn’t share a language with them.
Voice-Hurling Method: The Lunar can project the oud’s sound.
