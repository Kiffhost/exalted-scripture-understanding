Your character’s health track represents his current physical condition: how hurt he is right now, and how much punishment he can take before being rendered unconscious or dead. Characters can’t keep functioning at peak efficiency when wounded. The pain and mounting systemic damage of severe injuries can cripple even the hardiest warrior; this is represented in the form of [[#wound penalties]]. 

Characters have seven levels in their health track: one -0 health level, two -1 health levels, two -2 health levels, one -4 health level, and one Incapacitated health level. Exalted characters can gain more health levels by purchasing the Charm [[Charms/Solar/Resistance/Ox-Body Technique]].

# Losing Health

Characters lose health levels when they take damage from decisive attacks (see Chapter Five), [[environmental hazards]], poison, or when they otherwise suffer bodily trauma. There are three sorts of damage to which characters’ Health Tracks might be subjected: [[#Bashing]], [[#Lethal]], and [[#Aggravated]].

## Bashing

Bashing damage is inflicted by blunt trauma, contusions, and extreme stress placed on the body which doesn’t inflict gross physical injury. Examples of sources of bashing damage include fists, short falls, and heat exhaustion or severe cold. Bashing damage is recorded in the health track by marking through the box with a slash ( / ). If a character’s Incapacitated health box is marked through with a slash, the character is rendered unconscious.

A character whose health track is full of bashing damage, and who continues to take bashing damage, upgrades his existing damaged health levels to lethal damage on a one-for-one basis, moving from left to right across the health track. 

## Lethal

Lethal damage represents lacerations, punctures, burns, and massive tissue trauma. Potential sources of lethal damage include blades, arrows, falls from extreme heights, fire, and the claws and fangs of wild beasts. Lethal damage is recorded in the health track by marking through a box with an X. If a character’s Incapacitated health box is marked through with an X, the character is either dead or dying (which one is up to the Storyteller). 

Bashing damage is always marked in the next unmarked box on the health track, while lethal damage always “enters” at the left end of the track. Thus, a character who has taken three bashing damage already, and who then takes two levels of lethal damage, would mark through his left-most health boxes, “pushing” the bashing damage two boxes to the right, as shown in the illustration on page 173. 

## Aggravated

Finally, some injuries are considered aggravated damage. Aggravated damage is usually a result of powerful magic modifying damage that would otherwise be lethal. Any aggravated injury cannot be healed by magic, nor can its healing be sped up by magic—only natural rest and healing will mend it. Aggravated damage heals at the same speed as lethal damage, but is always the last damage to heal— mark it on the health track with an asterisk, “pushing” bashing and lethal damage to the right.

# Regaining Health 

Quickly regaining lost health is difficult, requiring rare and powerful magic. The more severely injured a character is, the longer healing takes. Characters heal [[#Bashing]] damage before [[#Lethal]], and their most severe injuries before their less serious ones—thus, healing “proceeds” across the health track from right to left. The Exalted, gods, and other magical beings with the [[Exalted Healing]] Merit replenish their lost health levels at the following rate: 
- Recovering a -0 health level takes one hour if bashing, or one day if lethal. 
- Recovering a -1 health level takes 12 hours if bashing, or two days if lethal. 
- Recovering a -2 health level takes one day if bashing, or three days if lethal. 
- Recovering a -4 health level takes two days if bashing, or five days if lethal. 
- Recovery from Incapacitation is up to the Storyteller— in the case of being knocked out by bashing damage, it usually happens at the end of the scene, but might happen in the same scene shortly after the end of combat (if the Storyteller wants to get the player back into the action), or could potentially occur hours later. Incapacitation by lethal damage is usually fatal, though the Storyteller can allow the character to linger at death’s doorstep for a few rounds, giving other characters a chance to stabilize him with emergency medical treatment. In this case, it might take hours, days, or even weeks before the character regains consciousness and heals his Incapacitated health level.
These times assume characters are primarily resting and avoiding strenuous exertion. If the character remains fully active while injured, double any healing times.

# wound penalties
As your character accumulates damage in his health track, he receives a dice penalty to all rolled actions, indicated by the highest number associated with a health level which has received damage. This wound penalty also applies to all of your character’s static values, such as [[Defense]] and [[Resolve]].

*[[Attack#damage roll|Damage rolls]] are exempt from wound penalties.*
