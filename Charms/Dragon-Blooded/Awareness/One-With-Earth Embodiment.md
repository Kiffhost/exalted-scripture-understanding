At one with Creation, the Dragon-Blood may flow through earth unimpeded. Touching an earthen surface, she may move into and through it as though moving in water. This counts as her movement action in combat. If she doesn’t emerge from the earth upon completing her movement, she must either use this Charm again on her next turn, waiving its Willpower cost, or be ejected from the earth at the point where she entered, falling prone and suffering an unpreventable level of bashing damage. However, while moving through stone, she gains the benefit of full cover (Exalted, p. 199) against all attacks unless an enemy uses a feat of strength, gambit, or appropriate stunt to create an opening through the stone.
