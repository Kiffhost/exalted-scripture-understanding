Ever adaptable, the Sidereal makes good use of whatever comes to hand. The Sidereal can fire any physical thing that’s no larger than her fist and no longer than her arm from an [[Archery]] weapon. This includes appropriately sized objects, but also things like fire, small animals, handfuls of dust, shouts, music, etc. Her missile isn’t damaged by its flight, letting her use this Charm to make long-distance deliveries or send shouted messages. The improvised projectile gains any tags appropriate to its nature. If an arrow’s nature lends itself to a gambit, its [[Initiative]] roll gains −1 target number. A second purchase of this Charm lets the Sidereal pay a one-[[Initiative]] surcharge to reflexively reload a weapon with the Slow tag. This lets her use it with magic that creates multiple attacks if she reloads before each attack past the first.
