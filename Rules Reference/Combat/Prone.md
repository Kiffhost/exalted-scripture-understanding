Certain attacks (such as [[Item Tags#Smashing]] attacks made by hammers, or being thrown by a grappler) can leave a character proneâ€”knocked forcefully to the ground. A prone character must take a rise from prone combat action (see p. 198) to regain his footing. As long as a character is prone, he suffers a -1 penalty to his [[Defense|Parry]], a -2 penalty to his [[Defense|Evasion]], a -3 penalty to attacks, and cannot take any movement actions other than to rise from prone. He also automatically fails all attempts to resist rush and disengage actions.
