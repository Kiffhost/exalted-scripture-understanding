This Evocation upgrades [[Strength From Conviction Stance]] (Miracles of the [[Solar Exalted]], p. 13). In a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], the wearer may call upon [[Sacrifice|sacrifices]] she’s made to protect her beloved or their relationship, even without a supporting [[Intimacy|Principle]]. Once per story, when she uses this Charm to resist a life-changing task (Exalted, p. 216), she may roll dice equal to (her [[Intimacy]] towards her beloved), shedding one point of [[Limit]] for each success.
