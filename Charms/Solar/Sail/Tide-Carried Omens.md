The Solar sails upon the merciless tides, far from the comforts of hearth and temple, and so her eyes are keen to omens that will guide her to safety. The Solar can foresee danger in the wheeling of gulls, the pattern of the clouds, the rush of currents, the contents of the fishing net and the gavotte of stars. She becomes aware of danger to ship, self, or crew ([[Essence]]) minutes before it arrives, gripped by an increasing sense of foreboding, though she does not know what the danger is. While shipboard, the character gains ([[Essence]]) bonus dice to [[Awareness]] rolls to detect danger, such as ambushes, rogue waves or poisoned meals. This Charm does not allow the Exalt to detect threats it would be impossible for mortal senses to notice, but it will aid [[Awareness]] [[Charms]] that can detect such dangers.
