The Solar’s effective delegation of power bolsters the might of Creation. To use this Charm, the Solar must confer advice to a bureaucracy either directly or through mediators (letters, messengers, etc.). The Lawgiver proposes bureaucratic reforms and operating sequences that are efficacious and skillful: roll ([[Charisma]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) against a difficulty of 5. If successful, the organization’s leaders gain a number of non-Charm dice equal to the roll’s extra successes. These dice can be used on (Solar’s [[Essence]]) [[Bureaucracy]], [[Investigation]], [[Larceny]], [[Lore]], [[Medicine]] or [[War]] rolls dealing with running a relevant organization or project. The Solar may enhance her own actions with this Charm, and if she or any other Solar is a beneficiary of this effect, the organization becomes a “Creational bulwark” on the spot. The Wyld cannot penetrate its territories, diseases struggle to cross its borders, and Shadowlands encroach upon it more slowly. This effect lasts one week.
