Moving in a sinuous, vine-like kata, the Immaculate entrances her foes. She makes an inspire roll with (Appearance + Performance) against one or more enemies that can see her to fill them with fascination. Each enemy whose Resolve is beaten cannot attack on his next turn, and cannot move away from the Immaculate without disengaging that turn. Once an enemy has resisted this influence with Willpower, he’s immune to losing his attack for the rest of the scene, but must still disengage to move away from the stylist. An enemy who carries the Immaculate’s soul mark must pay Willpower to resist twice before gaining this immunity.
