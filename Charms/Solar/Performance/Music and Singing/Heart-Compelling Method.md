The Lawgiver’s music pulls at the soul of her target, impellinghimtoactonhisdeepestdesires.ThisCharmcreates a inspire action in which the Solar performs a song with instrument, voice, or both. Her song must continue for at least one minute before it affects anyone—roll ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance) against the target’s Resolve. If her song is meant to convey sadness, it will automatically target an Intimacy in her target that reflects sorrow or regret, and may even revive a long-forgotten hurt to do so. The Solar’s player may define the character’s intent with the song, but on a success, the Storyteller gets to determine the exact Intimacy that is targeted and what behavior will manifest. As the Solar continues to play her most sorrowful tune, a prince might endlessly mourn his dead husband. With an aria that inspires hope, she might cause the prince to open his husband’s private gardens to the city’s children, in honor of an old wish.
