*The deathknight’s killing arts cut down foes with effortless grace, bloodying her blade without a hint of exertion.*
The Abyssal makes a decisive attack, which is unblockable and undodgeable unless her opponent enhances his Defense with magic. It deals (Essence + attack roll extra successes) dice of damage, ignoring Hardness.
This doesn’t include her Initiative or reset her to base.
If the Abyssal’s Initiative equals or exceeds this attack’s base damage, she waives the Willpower cost to use Artful Maiming Onslaught on the attack.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by dealing 3+ damage to a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack that resets the Abyssal to base Initiative, then reaching 12+ Initiative.
