When the Abyssal uses the Awareness Excellency, she can pay a two-mote surcharge to extend its duration until her next turn, providing its bonus to all Awareness rolls she makes to detect hidden enemies. Some Awareness Charms specify that their duration can be extended this way. The Abyssal need only pay the two-mote surcharge once to extend the duration of all valid Charms she activates at the same time, including the Excellency.
