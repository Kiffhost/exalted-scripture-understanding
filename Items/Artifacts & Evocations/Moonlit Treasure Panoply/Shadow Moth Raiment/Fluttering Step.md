Graceful as a moth in flight, the raimentâ€™s wearer outmaneuvers foes with nimble footwork.
The wearer adds an automatic success on a rush or disengage roll. If successful, until her next turn she gains +1 [[Defense|Evasion]] against each enemy whose opposed roll she beat.
## Resonant
The automatic success and [[Defense|Evasion]] bonus are non-Charm.
