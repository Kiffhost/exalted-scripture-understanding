The Lunar sinks into a deep trance, occluding her mundane senses so that her soul might see the world clearly. As long as she meditates, her senses are magnified. She sees in all directions simultaneously, as though every inch of her skin was an eye, and can see clearly out to a mile away. She can make hearing- or scent-based (Perception + Awareness) rolls out to (Essence) miles away, or (Essence x5) miles for very strong noises or smells such as a legion’s footfalls or a wildfire’s smoke. She doubles 7s on touch- or tastebased rolls. While meditating in a territory claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation (p. XX), she can make sight-, hearing-, and scent-based Perception rolls to perceive anything within the territory, regardless of distance or obstruction. This Charm ends if the Lunar ceases meditating. This Charm can be used while hibernating with Bear Sleep Technique (p. XX). This diminishes the extended range of the Lunar’s senses — every mile of range she’d normally enjoy is reduced to 100 yards — but negates the Perception penalty for hibernation. A Perception 5, Essence 4 repurchase lets the Lunar use this Charm without meditating while she has 8+ motes committed to Sense-Sharpening Change. This reduces its duration to one day.
