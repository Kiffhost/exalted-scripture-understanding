Through intense effort and concentration, the Dragon-Blood can channel a burst of flames through her attack. To use this Charm, she must first spend a turn aiming at an enemy within close range. On her next turn, she may usethisCharmtomakeadecisiveattackwithabasedamage of (her Essence + 2), ignoring Hardness. This doesnâ€™t include her Initiative or reset her to base Initiative. An enemy that takes 3+ levels of damage from the attack is set ablaze, suffering (Essence) dice of lethal damage on each of his turns until he extinguishes the flames. In Fire Aura, the Dragon-Blood may add her Initiative to the base damage of this attack. Doing so resets her Initiative to base.
