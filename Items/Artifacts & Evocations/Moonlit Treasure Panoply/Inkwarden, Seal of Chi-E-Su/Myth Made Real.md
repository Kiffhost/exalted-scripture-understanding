The imprimatur of Inkwarden’s master elevates masterpieces to things of legend.
When Inkwarden’s bearer is told a story of an object that aligns with one of her Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], she can use [[Masterpiece-Acclaiming Mark]] for five motes, one [[Willpower]] to imbue it with supernatural power. In addition to the influence, the object can be attuned as if it were an artifact, letting characters awaken [[Evocations]] from it. It doesn’t gain artifact weapon or armor traits, nor does it become indestructible.
The object’s [[Evocations]] are based on its legend and any [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] of Inkwarden’s master that aligned with the story. They have power comparable to those of a threedot artifact. The character that the object was created for waives the experience cost of the first Evocation he awakens this way.
If the object is destroyed, any experience spent on such [[Evocations]] is refunded. If Inkwarden’s bearer ends [[Masterpiece-Acclaiming Mark]], she can use it again to restore this power to a previously blessed object. Doing so requires no roll and doesn’t require the object to be present. However, if circumstances render a player character effectively unable to regain such [[Evocations]], the Storyteller should provide a refund.
