*Disease and pestilence cannot stand against the [[Solar Exalted]].*
This Charm represents an hour spent treating a patient for an illness the Exalt has properly diagnosed. Roll the Exalt’s ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) against the disease’s morbidity (p. 233) and add half the extra successes to the patient’s [[Resistance]] roll at the next interval. 
Through this Charm, the Solar can weaken or even cure supernatural maladies such as the Great Contagion. However, the target must remain in bed, and must be bathed, fed, and otherwise given care for the duration of the next interval. These ministrations can be performed by the Solar’s assistants. The Exalt may use this Charm to treat her own diseases, though some may require a stunt or special instruments to treat.
