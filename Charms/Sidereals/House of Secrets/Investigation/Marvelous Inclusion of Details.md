*The world aids the Sidereal in her investigations, contriving to present her with exactly the evidence she was looking for.*
The Sidereal completes a case scene or profile character roll instantly. If she has a relevant [[Intimacy]], she adds ([[Intimacy]]) bonus dice. If successful, her player may specify the type of evidence she wishes to receive: “the murder weapon,” “footprints,” “the door to a secret passageway,” etc. As long as there’s something like that involved in the Sidereal’s investigation and it being at the scene wouldn’t contradict established facts or the Storyteller’s plans, she uncovers it serendipitously. If not, she finds the closest equivalent evidence.
