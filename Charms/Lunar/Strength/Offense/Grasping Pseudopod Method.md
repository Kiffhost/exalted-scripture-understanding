*The Lunarâ€™s limbs dissolve and flow around her foe before reforming, entrapping him in an inescapable embrace.*
To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 15+. On a successful grapple, she makes two control rolls and takes the higher result. The cost of any [[Charms]] used to enhance the rolls need only be paid once. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Legendary [[Size]] or animal shapes with grapple-related abilities, the Lunar may pay a two-[[Initiative]] surcharge to activate this Charm reflexively after a successful grapple attack roll, but before the [[Initiative]] roll.
