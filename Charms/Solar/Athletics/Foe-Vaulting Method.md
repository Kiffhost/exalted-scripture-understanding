*Fearless in combat, the Solar leaps over her stunned opponent.*
At close range, if the Exalt has higher [[Initiative]] (before cost) than her foe, she may use this Charm on her turn, rolling [[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]] against her opponentâ€™s [[Defense|Evasion]]. If successful, she leaps over her target, creating an opening, and may make a surprise attack (see p. 203) overhead or at their back. This Charm may only be used once per combat, but is reset by landing a decisive attack and building [[Initiative]] to 6+.
