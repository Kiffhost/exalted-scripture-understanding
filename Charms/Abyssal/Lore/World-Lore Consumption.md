*The Abyssal savant’s hunger for knowledge is insatiable, a maw ever ravening for secrets.*
The Abyssal adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm successes on [[Lore]] rolls that benefit from a specialty. If she succeeds on a difficulty 3+ roll to introduce or challenge a fact, she gains a [[Lore#Background]] in a relevant topic. This doesn’t grant her a specialty.
At the end of each story, the Abyssal gains a [[Lore]] specialty appropriate to that story’s events at no experience point cost.
