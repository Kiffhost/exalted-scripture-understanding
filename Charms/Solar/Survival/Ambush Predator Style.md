Following the pulse of [[Essence]] that forms at the moment of battle, the Solar guides her familiar on the attack. This Charm enhances a familiar’s [[Join Battle]] roll, allowing it to use the Solar’s ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) dice pool for the roll, and granting it (Exalt’s [[Essence]]) non-Charm successes. Furthermore, if the Solar has used [[Familiar-Honing Instruction]] to order the familiar into battle, thereby enhancing this roll, each bonus die creates a cascading reroll— for each of these dice that turns up a success, reroll another die until the cascade fails to produce any successes.
