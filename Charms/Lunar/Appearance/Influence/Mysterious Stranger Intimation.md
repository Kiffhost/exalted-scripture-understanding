The Lunar exudes enticing mystery and the allure of the unfamiliar, drawing curious stares and fascinated admirers. She gains +1 Guile against characters affected by Alluring Scent Technique. Against characters who don’t know her or have any Ties toward her (or alternatively, who don’t know or have Ties toward her current shape), that Charm’s effect extends to medium range and isn’t limited to characters of the same species. Such characters are driven to act on their curiosity, with the exact method depending on the Lunar’s presentation and their own Intimacies. If the Lunar enters a teahouse dressed in foreign garb, other patrons might attempt to read her intentions; if she wears a tiger’s shape, bystanders might observe from a safe distance. A character may pay one Willpower to resist this effect (but not the effects of Alluring Scent Technique) for the scene.
