When the Sidereal’s partners make fools of themselves, she steps in to repair their reputations. When a character the Sidereal has a positive Tie toward fails a roll, she can use social influence to leverage that failure as though it were a Minor Tie possessed by characters who observed the failure. The influence it supports depends on the failure’s specifics, but the Storyteller should give the Sidereal’s player wide leeway, especially if she stunts. She adds ([[Intimacy]]) dice on all such influence rolls.
