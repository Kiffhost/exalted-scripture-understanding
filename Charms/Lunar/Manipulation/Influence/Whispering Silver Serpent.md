*Such are the depths of the Lunar’s deception that even she believes it.*
When she lies — either in an influence roll or ordinary dialogue — she convinces herself that she’s telling the truth. Until end of scene, read intentions or [[profile character]] rolls can’t reveal any evidence that she lied. Even mind-reading magic shows that she believes what she’s saying. This Charm can contest lie-detecting magic like [[Judge’s Ear Technique]]. Such contests are resolved by opposed rolls, with the Lunar rolling ([[Manipulation]] + {Larceny, [[Presence]], or Socialize}) with ([[Essence]]) bonus dice. If successful, her statement appears true.
