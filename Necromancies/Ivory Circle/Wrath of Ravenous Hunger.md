*Calling to her foe’s lower soul as one might lure a hungry dog with bloody meat, the necromancer grants it greater sway.*
The necromancer makes a ({[[Manipulation]] or [[Intelligence]]} + [[Occult]]) roll against the [[Resolve]] of a living character within medium range. Success awakens and strengthens his lower soul, filling him with violent urges and insatiable hunger. He suffers a −(higher of necromancer’s [[Essence]] or 3) penalty to all rolls requiring a level head or careful foresight. The amount of food he must consume to avoid starvation is multiplied by (necromancer’s [[Essence]] + 2), and he can only sustain himself on meat. Others may exploit these urges and hunger as if they were a Major [[Intimacy]], though failed attempts at such influence automatically create a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] as per a failed [[threaten]] action (Exalted, p. 217). Characters who die while cursed always leave a hungry ghost if able.
Alternatively, the necromancer can use this spell against the undead, even when they lack a lower soul, strengthening the vestigial echo of their hunger. Her target may use the stats of a hungry ghost (Exalted, p. 503) if they’re superior to their own, and gain the Blood Scent and Earthbound [[Merits]]. While they can’t starve, they suffer [[deprivation]] penalties if they go more than ([[Stamina]]) days without tasting living blood.
## Control
Starving characters double their [[deprivation]] penalty (Exalted, p. 232) while in medium range of the necromancer, and hungry ghosts automatically have a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of deference or respect for her.
Whenever she passes by an unburied corpse, it groans uncontrollably with an echo of hunger.
## Distortion (10)
So long as the target can satisfy their increased appetite, he reduces the penalty to thoughtful actions by two, and his feelings of hunger and wrath can only be leveraged as a Minor [[Intimacy]] for the duration.
