The proud institutions of the First Age lie in ruins, and knowledge is the province of an exclusive few. In this fallen world, a man can live and die knowing of nothing beyond his meager village. To the Solars of the Twilight Caste, this state of affairs is unacceptable—as scholars, craftsmen and sorcerers, it is their duty to carry the light of learning into the darkness of ignorance. They are among mankind’s most brilliant minds, and they are not content to spend their lives in a library, sanctum, or workshop—they need to be out in the world, putting their learning to use.

During the height of the First Age, the Arrows of Heaven created wonders of infrastructure, granting Creation’s people good health and lush farmlands. They built cities that reached to the heavens, and pooled their knowledge in schools and libraries so that all who wished to could learn. Many Twilights were mighty sorcerers as well, plumbing the depths of reality with great workings. As the Usurpation unfolded, many of the Copper Spiders hid their greatest works, leaving caches of lore and treasure for their eventual successors. Most remaining First Age artifacts survived as a result of a Twilight’s foresight and determination—though the Dragon-Blooded cut them down, fragments of their legacy survived.

Now the Twilights have returned, ready to reclaim their birthrights and build a glorious future. Whether they’re constructing a manse or solving a murder, they approach their work with keen insight and dogged persistence. They remember the glories of the lost age and know those glories can be rebuilt. The process will take the work of many mortal lifetimes, but none are better-suited to it than the Twilights.

Many Descending Suns were well-educated before their Exaltation, but far more important is a desire to learn. Whether they’re physicians, occultists, or savants, Heaven’s Lamps are marked by endless curiosity and undeniable brilliance. Twilights often do most of a Circle’s intellectual heavy lifting, recounting old lore to find a troublesome demon’s weakness or deduce a captured spy’s cipher. Twilights with a talent for artifice or sorcery supply their Circlemates with bound servitors and potent spells, or craft wondrous tools custom-made for their allies.

# Anima Banner

The Twilight Caste Mark is a golden circle on the brow, filled in on top with the bottom half empty. Twilight animas are a splendid riot of evening colors, encompassing bright golds and reds, as well as subdued blues and violet hues. 

# Anima Effects

Recognizing the mark of the Unconquered Sun’s divine authority over the cosmos that burns within the Essence of every Twilight, the universe bends to protect Heaven’s Lamps from destruction. She may also bind lesser spirits to her service. See page 176 for details. 

- For five motes, the Twilight projects an aura of pure force, reflexively gaining five Hardness for one turn. At the bonfire/iconic level, this power activates itself automatically at no cost. This effect doesn’t stack with other magic that raises Hardness, but it can be used during Initiative Crash.
- For 10 motes, one Willpower, the Twilight’s anima flares blue and white and consumes her body over the course of the round. On her next turn, she vanishes into her anima and ceases to exist. If the Exalt moves or suffers knockdown before the action is completed, it fails and the effect is wasted. After using this power, the Twilight will not reappear until the following sunset. When she does, it will be at a place of power within 10 miles of her vanishing point, chosen by the Storyteller. She might appear at a temple, a demesne, a major crossroads, the door of a god’s sanctum, the precise center of a city, etc.
- For 10 motes, the Twilight may touch an Essence 1-3 elemental or a demon of the first circle, conjoining its Essence to her anima. Roll Intelligence + Occult against the creature’s Resolve. If successful, this creates a pact that changes the spirit into her familiar, allowing her to target it with applicable Survival Charms. In addition, the Twilight can reflexively summon the spirit instantly for three motes, drawing it through the Essence of the world to appear beside her. She may banish the creature again, reflexively, for free, returning it to the tides of Essence that suffuse Creation until needed. The Twilight may have up to (Essence) spirit familiars bound in this fashion at once.

# Solar Experience Trigger

Learning lost lore of the First Age or similarly valuable knowledge, learning something that helps advance or protect a Major or Defining Intimacy, discovering a supernatural being’s mystic secrets (such as a ghost’s lingering passions, the obsession that drives a demon’s nature, or an ancient oath that still binds one of the Fair Folk), solving a significant problem or crisis through the application of knowledge or through education, or creating a lasting and meaningful work of mystical power in the world (such as forging a sorcerous working or artifact, or binding a demon to protect a valley until the end of the age).
