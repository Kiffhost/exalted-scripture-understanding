While this moonstone is socketed in an attuned one-handed artifact weapon, the Exalt can create a single duplicate of the weapon from moonlight and shadow as a miscellaneous action. The duplicate has the same traits as the original, granting the benefits of dual wielding, but doesn’t have any of its magical effects. It dissolves if either it or the original is wielded by another. Jewel of the Rabbit’s Sword (Sidereal, Standard) Keywords: Wild-born
This chartreuse gem’s facets seem to change in number and shape each time they’re viewed. The stone counters ill fate with luck; once per day, its bearer may spend one Willpower to reroll all 1s for a single non-extended action until no 1s remain.
