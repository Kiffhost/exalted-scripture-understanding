The Charms that initiate the Solar Exalted into sorcery also give them a free shaping ritual, which is how most of the Chosen gain access to them. As a Solar sorcerer rises through the three circles, he gains more shaping rituals. These can be taken from rituals offered by his original archetype, but by no means is he limited to those. If the character has used his sorcerous power to make pacts with spirits, create great strongholds of knowledge, or transcend the mental confines of petty humanity, then itâ€™s entirely fitting for him to gain rituals that reflect those achievements.
