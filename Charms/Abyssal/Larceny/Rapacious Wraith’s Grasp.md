*Reaching through silence and shadow, the deathknight harries her foes.*
The Abyssal makes an unarmed disarm or distract gambit with ([[Dexterity]] + [[Larceny]]). This can also be used to make custom gambits that benefit from diversion and legerdemain. If the gambit succeeds, the Abyssal’s victim loses [[Initiative]] equal to the gambit’s cost. If this crashes him, the deathknight gains the lost [[Initiative]] in addition to receiving an [[Initiative]] Break.
If the deathknight knows [[Reality-Subverting Gesture]], she can use it to make a gambit at short range and double 9s on the attack roll.
