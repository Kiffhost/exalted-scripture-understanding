The Dragon-Blood conceals her soul’s depths from even her own Sworn Kin, twisting their oath to blind her brothers to her true self. When one of her Hearthmates rolls against her [[Guile]], she adds any positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] that Hearthmate has toward her to her [[Guile]] as a nonCharm bonus.
Additionally, when a Hearthmate attempts to sense her with his anima power, she’s aware of it and may attempt to deceive him. He rolls ([[Perception]] + [Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Socialize]) opposing her [[Guile]]; if he fails, she causes him to sense her as being at a point within long range of her. Should she die, she may conceal this from her Sworn Kin as well.
Should the Dragon-Blood betray a Hearthmate, she loses only one point of [[Willpower]], not all of it.
