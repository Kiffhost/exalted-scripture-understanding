*With a terrible ripping motion, the sainted terror reveals her foe’s iniquities for all to see.*
After damaging an unfaithful enemy with a decisive attack, the wielder may use this Evocation to reveal his greatest betrayal, ripping a phantasm free from his flesh that reveals his iniquity to all who see it. The victim can take (wielder’s [[Essence]]) levels of unpreventable aggravated damage to prevent this, consumed from within by the terrible weight of his secret shame.
Against enemies wrongly branded as unfaithful with [[Suffer the Blameless]], this instead reveals their innocence to the wielder and refunds this Evocation’s cost.
## Resonant
The victim of the betrayal learns of it even if they aren’t present. If the victim is dead, the betrayal is instead revealed to whoever is most likely to avenge them.
## Dissonant
Enemies who conceal their betrayal suffer dice of damage, not levels.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial faithless enemy.
