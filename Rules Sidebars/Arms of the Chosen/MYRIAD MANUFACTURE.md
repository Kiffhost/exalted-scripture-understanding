While marvels such as daiklaves or warstriders are always unique (p. 12), some artifacts, such as Brass Legionnaires, exist as part of a greater whole. In the First Age, Creation-wide webs of miraculous infrastructure permitted artificers to manufacture such artifacts in batches. Without that infrastructure, creating artifacts on such a scale is impossible.
