Those who’ve known the Lunar’s sweet succor can never find satisfaction in the arms of any other; their hearts belong to her forevermore. She makes an ([[Appearance]] + [Performance or Presence]) bargain or persuade roll with (current temporary [[Willpower]]) bonus dice to seduce a character with a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of love, lust, etc., toward her (or her current form). If successful, she also inflicts the Obsession [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 168) with an intensity equal to that of his [[Intimacy|Tie]] to her, even if he resists with [[Willpower]]. The Lunar, and physical or emotional [[intimacy]] with her, are the object of his obsession. He must immediately make a [[Willpower]] roll against the [[Derangement]]. Each time the victim fails a [[Willpower]] roll against this [[Derangement]], the Storyteller chooses one of his Ties based on lust, desire, or romantic love for someone other than the Lunar to erode by one step, beginning with Minor Ties and working up. Once all such Ties are gone, subsequent failures create or strengthen a [[Intimacy|Principle]] of “I will not share [[intimacy]] with anyone but the Lunar.” The Lunar’s victim must pay two [[Willpower]] each time he wishes to voluntarily erode his [[Intimacy|Tie]] of love or lust toward her. [[Influence]] rolls to weaken that [[Intimacy|Tie]] face the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221). If the victim fully erodes this [[Intimacy|Tie]], he may begin eroding the [[Derangement]] at a rate of one level of intensity each month, paying three [[Willpower]] each time he does so. This Charm can only be used against a character once per story.
