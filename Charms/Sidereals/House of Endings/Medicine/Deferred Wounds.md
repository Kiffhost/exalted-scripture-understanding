*The Sidereal postpones the hour of her patient’s death, making his wounds seem to vanish with a touch.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]), healing levels of damage equal to her successes. This damage is held in abeyance for this Charm’s duration, diminishing over time with the patient’s natural healing (Exalted, p. 173). If this Charm ends before all damage is healed, the remaining levels are inflicted on the patient.
