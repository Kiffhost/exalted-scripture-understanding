*Attuned to the Underworld’s strange tides, the deathknight charts courses unknown to mortal mariners.*
The Abyssal sails from Creation to a location in the Underworld or vice versa, rolling ({Intelligence or Wits} + [[Sail]]) after an hour spent charting a course.
Rather than traveling based on distance, she travels to a locale similar in nature to her starting point: a ship sailing the Scavenger Lands’s rivers may emerge on a distant eastern tributary of the Styx; a galleon fleeing a bone-kraken in the scattered island chains of the Underworld’s Western seas could escape to the Wavecrest Archipelago in Creation.
The difficulty of the roll depends on the approximate distance between the two points: difficulty 3 for what would be a journey of a few days, difficulty 5 for a journey of months, or difficulty 10+ for a journey between Directions. The [[Storyteller]] can also modify the difficulty based on the thematic similarity between the deathknight’s starting point and destination. For instance, the difficulty might be halved for a journey from an island in Creation to its inhabitants’ ritual afterlife.
If the Abyssal succeeds, strange mists as she sails through the veil between worlds. She appears at her destination no more than five days
