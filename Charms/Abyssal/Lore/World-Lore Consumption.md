*The Abyssal savant’s hunger for knowledge is insatiable, a maw ever ravening for secrets.*
The Abyssal adds (Essence) non-Charm successes on Lore rolls that benefit from a specialty. If she succeeds on a difficulty 3+ roll to introduce or challenge a fact, she gains a Lore background in a relevant topic (Exalted, p. 153). This doesn’t grant her a specialty.
At the end of each story, the Abyssal gains a Lore specialty appropriate to that story’s events at no experience point cost.
