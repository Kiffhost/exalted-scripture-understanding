This ocean-going vessel has a hull of strong, gold-tinged wood and brilliant white sails. It requires no crew: the ship handles its own sail, bilge and maintenance. It needs only a captain. From the helm, the captain can verbally command the rest of the ship using her Sail skill. 

At its owner’s command, this ship can fold itself up in a visual spectacle, completing the one-minute process as a 1’ x 6” x 6” box that weighs 20 pounds. It takes just as long for the boat to unfold. The ship has the traits of a standard, nonmagical vessel decided at the time of its creation or purchase—several models of folding ships were created in the long-ago days when the Exalted made such wonders, from fast couriers to war triremes. The vessel repairs all damage if it spends one full day as a box. The captain must commit seven motes to use this artifact.
