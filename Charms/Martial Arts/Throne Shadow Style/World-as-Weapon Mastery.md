Shadow Lost in the Court The vizier need not act to seize victory; the lessons she’s imparted to her shadow fingers have already ensured her triumph. The stylist can enhance the attacks of shadow fingers present in the same scene with the following techniques: Deadliest of All Weapons (5m, 1wp; Reflexive; Dual): After a shadow finger’s withering attack crashes an enemy or his decisive attack hits, the stylist asks that enemy one question, to which he must respond truthfully (in character) unless he spends one Willpower. Incapacitated enemies answer before succumbing to their wounds. Flow-Breaking Strike (2m, 1wp; Supplemental; Decisive-only): Each 9 and 10 on a decisive attack also causes the enemy to lose one Initiative, which the shadow finger doesn’t gain. Pneuma-Sealing Strike (5m; Reflexive; Withering-only): After a withering damage roll, the shadow finger can forgo up to (his Essence + stylist’s Essence) Initiative awarded by it. Each point of Initiative forgone reduces the number of motes regained by the damaged enemy at the end of the round by one. If this exceeds the amount he’d recover, the excess is applied to the next round’s recovery. Welcoming the Uninvited Guest (3m; Supplemental; Uniform): The shadow finger can attack an enemy he’s unaware of as long as the stylist is aware of him and has beaten his Stealth, if applicable. In Throne Shadow Form, if the stylist enhances an attack with multiple techniques with Willpower costs, she need only pay one Willpower. 
## Mastery

The stylist’s shadow fingers can pay the cost of these techniques instead of her. 
## Terrestrial

This Charm’s minimum Essence increases to 4. Each of its techniques can only be used once per scene, unless reset when a shadow finger lands a decisive attack that resets his Initiative and builds back to Initiative 15+. This resets all used techniques. Violet Bier of Sorrows Style Violet Bier of Sorrows is an ancient style, old as the First Age if not older. Some stories attribute its creation to a Sidereal inspired by the Maiden of Endings’ power and conviction; others say it arose from the ancient cult of Saturn, attribute it to one of the many legendary martial artists of the First Age, or claim that Saturn herself created it. It emphasizes speed, exploiting enemies’ injuries, and powerful killing blows. Its students often cultivate detachment from emotion and compassion in battle, able to act infinitesimally faster than enemies because they do not feel the emotional experience of violence in the moment. The Division of Endings has maintained the style’s lineage unbroken for millennia, but it is not other schools exist in Creation. In the Spindrift Archipelago, the Cult of Saturn Pharmacopeia practices an ancient variant of the style, often aiding and training peasant uprisings. Sijan’s Reverent Lodge of the Broken Sepulcher, a secret society and trade guild of morticians, studies the style as a philosophical and mystical discipline. The dueling academies of seven-bridged Padhia teach a bastardized offshoot, the so-called Silent Executioner style. Violet Bier of Sorrows Weapons: This style’s unarmed attacks are primarily open-palmed blows, knife-hand strikes, and graceful kicks, all executed with flowing ease. It’s also compatible with chopping swords, great swords, short swords, slashing swords, straight swords, knives, staffs, and seven-section staffs. Armor: This style is incompatible with armor.
