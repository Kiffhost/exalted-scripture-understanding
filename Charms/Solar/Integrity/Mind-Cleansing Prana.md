*Through concentration, controlled breathing, and rumination on the solid core of her Principles, the Solar becomes one with the flow of [[Essence]].*
This Charm entails an hour spent in meditation to clear a penalty having to do with the Exaltâ€™s perceptions of a circumstance she finds herself in. It grants two automatic successes or erases up to -2 in penalties from [[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], [[Survival]], and any other rolls requiring concentration, difficult abstract thought, complex puzzling of unrelated facts or an opening of the senses. This may explicitly aid the Lawgiver in reading intentions. Successfully resolving an action with this Charm grants the Exalt one point of temporary [[Willpower]].
