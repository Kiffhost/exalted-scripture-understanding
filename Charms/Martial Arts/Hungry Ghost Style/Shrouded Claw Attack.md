*Wreathed in entropic Essence, the stylist’s strike corrodes her enemy’s defenses.*
The stylist’s withering attack inflicts a −1 penalty on her target’s [[Defense]] and [[soak]] against it. If she has a relevant [[Intimacy]] of primal emotion, the soak penalty increases to –([[Intimacy]]).
## Mastery
If the stylist crashes the target, he suffers this Charm’s penalty until he recovers from crash.
