*The seas have surrendered their secrets to the deathknight, ripped from their depths over many journeys.*
The Abyssal can introduce facts about waterways she’s familiar with and travel along them with ([Intelligence or Wits] + [[Sail]]), adding ([[Essence]]) automatic successes. She doesn’t need an applicable [[Lore]] background, but if she has one, the successes are non-Charm. This includes facts about weather, currents, trade routes and the commerce conducted along them, aquatic plants and animals, nearby islands and ports, and similar.
When the Abyssal introduces a fact about the Underworld’s waterways, she’s not limited to those she’s familiar with. Knowledge of unfamiliar shores comes to her in feverish visions and eerie auguries.
