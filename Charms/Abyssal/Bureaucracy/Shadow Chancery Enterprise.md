*The deathknight’s secret plans come to fruition, unseen in the darkness.*
The Abyssal initiates a bureaucratic project or task in complete secrecy. [[Investigation]] or [[Bureaucracy]] rolls to investigate the project while it’s ongoing automatically and read intentions rolls that would reveal details of it fail automatically unless the investigator uses magic to enhance them or has a relevant Defining [[Intimacy]]. Even then, they suffer a −4 penalty, and 1s on the roll subtract successes. Characters must always roll to notice details about the project, even if no roll would normally be required, like overhearing workers discussing it, must be rolled at a difficulty 1.
These benefits extend to the completed project until it is revealed through use. The work itself may be evident, but its goal is obscured; during a project to raise a profane monument in a city square, the ongoing construction can be perceived, but what is being built is magically obscured until it is completed.
