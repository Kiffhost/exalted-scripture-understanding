*The Lunar renders her body malleable and amorphous, flowing through binding chains or a mighty beast’s grasp.*
This Charm aids in escaping physical restraints on the Lunar’s person, like picking the lock on manacles around her wrists or wriggling out of ropes tied around her. She doubles 9s and adds ([[Essence]]) successes. Against !!mundanerestraints,sheescapesregardlessofherroll’sresult—!! instead, failure means a complication ensues, such as her !!lockpickbreakingassheopensthemanacles,orherescape!! taking long enough that her captors have returned. Alternatively, this Charm can be used when the Lunar opposes an enemy’s grapple control roll, rolling with ([[Dexterity]] + {Athletics, [[Brawl]], [[Larceny]], or Martial Arts}) and doubling 9s. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with [[Merits]] that enhance rolls to squeeze through tight spaces, the Lunar doubles 8s instead.
