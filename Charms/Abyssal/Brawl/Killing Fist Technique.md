*The Abyssal’s violent endeavors have honed and hardened her fists.*
The Abyssal’s unarmed attacks can deal lethal damage, and she can parry attacks that deal lethal damage bare-handed. For one mote, an unarmed withering attack ignores ([[Essence]]) soak. If she has an [[Intimacy]] relevant to her motivation for fighting, she ignores ([[Essence]] + [[Intimacy]]) soak.
