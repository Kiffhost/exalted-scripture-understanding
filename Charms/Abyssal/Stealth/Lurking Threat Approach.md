*The Abyssal sows terror from the shadows, her voice echoing from everywhere and nowhere.*
When the Abyssal makes a threaten roll from concealment, enemies who can’t perceive her suffer –2 [[Resolve]]. Doing so doesn’t break concealment. If she uses this while holding an enemy at bay (Exalted, p.
204), she also increases the [[Willpower]] cost to resist by one.
