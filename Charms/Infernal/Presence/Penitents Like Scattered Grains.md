*Each prayer spoken to the Infernal is a single grain of sand, easily lost amid countless others — but not for her. Such is her mercy that none who praise her name shall go unheard.*

The Infernal can hear prayers directed to her. Making out useful information from the background susurrus of prayer requires a difficulty 4 (Perception + Presence) roll. The difficulty can vary based on factors like making a valuable sacrifice alongside the prayer, large groups of people making the same prayer, and so on. She doesn’t need to roll to hear supplicants within (Cult) miles of her.

When the Infernal hears a prayer made from a shrine or temple that she’s raised to herself or a region that she’s corrupted with [[Holy Land Infliction]] (p. XX) or similar Infernal Charms, she can pay two motes to answer it. A random nearby object begins to glow and takes on her image, lasting just long enough for her to respond — which may include an influence roll. She can’t use Charms to enhance it.

While using this Charm, the Infernal gains a Minor Tie of patronizing benevolence to her worshippers, which can’t be fully removed by any means. If she already has such an Intimacy, its Resolve penalty is increased by one instead.

With Presence 5, Essence 3, the Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to answer a prayer regardless of where it’s made from. The Willpower cost is waived when answering prayers made from a temple or shrine to her.
## [[Keys]]
#### Heritor of Worshipful Voices
The Infernal can manifest her presence in answer to prayers even if they aren’t made at a temple or shrine.
#### Above All Others (Presence 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal can use this Charm to eavesdrop on prayers made to another character, requiring a (Perception + Integrity) roll at a difficulty of that character’s (Cult). She can only do so if she’s had a meaningful interaction with that character in the current story, or while at a temple to him. She doesn’t gain a Tie to his followers. The Infernal can stack this Charm to listen to prayers made to multiple characters. If she uses this key together with Symphony of Sinful Prayers she makes a single roll for both.
#### Immanent Numinous Presence (Presence 5, Essence 2) (+3m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she manifests in answer to a prayer made from within (Cult) miles, remaining manifest there for the rest of the scene. She can make Perception rolls to observe her surroundings and influence rolls, but can’t enhance them with Charms.
#### Thousand Voices Litany (Presence 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal gains this Charm’s effects permanently (this doesn’t apply when using [[#Above All Others (Presence 5, Essence 2)|Above All Others]]). The range at which she can hear prayers without needing to roll increases to (Cult x5) miles. She also doesn’t need to roll to hear prayers made from temples to her or regions that she’s corrupted. This also increases the range of this Charm’s other keys.
#### One with the Faithful (Essence 3, [[#Heritor of Worshipful Voices|Heritor of Worshipful Voices]], [[#Immanent Numinous Presence (Presence 5, Essence 2) (+3m, 1wp)|Immanent Numinous Presence]])
When a group of the Infernal’s cultists within (Cult) miles of her notices something she’d be interested in, she can use [[#Immanent Numinous Presence (Presence 5, Essence 2) (+3m, 1wp)|Immanent Numinous Presence]] to appear. Rather than manifesting an apparition, she sees with her worshippers’ eyes and speaks with their voices.
