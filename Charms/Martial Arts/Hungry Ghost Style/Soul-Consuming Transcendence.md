*Arcs of deathly white Essence swirl around the Hungry Ghost master as she opens her lower soul’s spiritual maw to consume her foes.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have Initiative 12+. She makes a decisive attack against an enemy with lower Initiative, adding dice of damage equal to the difference between their Initiative ratings, up to a maximum of the stylist’s Initiative. If she has a relevant Intimacy of primal emotion, she adds (Essence + Intimacy) to her effective Initiative to determine both the bonus and the maximum damage she can add.
This soul-destroying attack is especially potent against living enemies and ghosts, dealing aggravated damage.
If such an enemy is incapacitated, the stylist devours his higher soul, gaining (his Essence) motes. If she slays one of the living, his lower soul will always rise as a hungry ghost (Exalted, p. 503) the next time the sun sets unless he’s put to rest with magic like the Zenith Caste anima. These revenants have a Defining Tie of terrified obedience toward the martial artist.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by crashing an enemy whose Initiative was higher than the stylist’s.
### Mastery
When the stylist consumes an enemy’s soul, she may incur experience debt (p. XX) to instantly learn up to (Essence) dots of Martial Arts styles that her victim knew. She can also learn one of his Martial Arts Charms, Eclipse Charms, or necromantic spells whose prerequisites she meets. She can’t learn sorcerous spells. She can’t learn Sidereal Martial Arts unless she devours a Sidereal’s soul.
### Terrestrial
This Charm can only be used against crashed enemies.
Albicant Sepulcher of Extinction Style This is the forbidden art of the Bishop of the Chalcedony Thurible, a gospel of death preached through violence. Nonexistence is not to be feared — the ghost who would become the Bishop understood this as he looked upon the Neverborn, forever denied the succor of oblivion.
Violence, then, is the truest act of compassion. People cling to their transient existence, mistaking the suffering and the sorrow of life for something meaningful.
They fear death, dreading the arrival of that which is inevitable. It is a kindness to free them from such fetters. The nothingness that follows their death will be no more intolerable than that which preceded their birth.
Few save the Bishop have studied this style. Even among the Deathlords, the power to practice Sidereal Martial Arts is rare, while only a scarce handful of Abyssals have yet attained the spiritual mastery needed to learn them. Many of his fellow Deathlords covet this power and would grudgingly bear whatever steep cost the Bishop would extract to train a promising deathknight.
### Albicant Sepulcher Weapons
With sweeping movements displaying minimal effort, the stylist directs her foes into nonexistence. It’s also compatible with staffs and scythes.
### Armor
This style is incompatible with armor.
### Nature
Still.
### Prerequisites
Learning Sidereal Martial Arts requires all Charms of a single Martial Arts style or any ten Martial Arts Charms. Ordinarily, a Sidereal teacher is also required, but the Bishop of the Chalcedony Thurible is also capable of teaching this style.
### Special
Abyssals who’ve learned all of this style’s Charms gain access to the benefits of the Enlightenment keyword benefits for them.
