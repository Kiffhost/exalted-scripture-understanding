Centering her mind and spirit, the Dragon-Blood embodies the stability of the omphalos, walking unscathed through the chaos of the Wyld. She and any items she carries are impervious to physical transformation or addiction caused by Wyld exposure, as well as similar environmental effects that warp mind or body. This doesn’t protect her from shaping magic used by other characters or from non-transformative perils of the Wyld. An Integrity 5, Essence 3 repurchase lets the Dragon-Blood pay a five-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s effects to her Hearthmates out to medium range.
