Lightning Stroke Attack Warrior, weapon, and soul join in perfect predatory unity as the Lunar unleashes a single unerring strike. Her anima trails behind it, casting off countless after-images of her iconic display that converge on her foe. To use this Charm, she must be aiming at a crashed enemy whose Initiative is at least 20 lower than hers. She makes an unblockable, undodgeable decisive attack against him, adding attack roll extra successes as dice of damage. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 20+ Initiative from a withering attack that crashes an enemy whose Initiative was higher than the Lunar’s. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has a vision-enhancing Merit may learn this as a Perception Charm, with Dread Tiger’s Eye (p. XX) and Heart-Piercing Instinct as its prerequisites.
