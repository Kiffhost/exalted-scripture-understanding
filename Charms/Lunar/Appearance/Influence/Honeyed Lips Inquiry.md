*Enthralled by the Lunar’s beauty, her paramours heedlessly reveal whatever she wishes to hear.*
She makes an ([[Appearance]] + {Performance or Presence}) persuade or bargain roll to seduce a single character. If successful, each extra success lets her ask him a question that scene which he must answer completely and truthfully, unless doing so would oppose one of his Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. He may avoid answering questions for one [[Willpower]] each, although the Lunar can repeat questions. The Lunar can only use this Charm on a given character once per story. 
## Protean
If the Lunar seduces her target in a human shape he has a positive Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward, he can’t withhold answers even if revealing them violates a different Defining [[Intimacy]] unless he spends [[Willpower]].
