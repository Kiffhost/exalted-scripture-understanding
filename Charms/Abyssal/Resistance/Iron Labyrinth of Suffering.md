*Countless chains twist and coil around the deathknight’s victims, imprisoning them in the Abyssal’s iron grasp.*
While using Chain-and-Armor Mortification, the Abyssal makes a grapple gambit against all enemies within close range or up to (Stamina) enemies within her chains’ full range. She makes only one attack roll and Initiative roll against all enemies but rolls (Strength + Brawl) separately to establish control against each enemy.
While clinching multiple enemies, the Abyssal’s grapple actions are expanded:
### Savage
The Abyssal makes a single savaging attack roll against any number of grappled enemies. Withering attacks roll damage separately against each grappled foe. Only the single highest withering damage roll awards Initiative to the Abyssal, although she can receive Initiative Breaks for crashing multiple foes.
Decisive savaging attacks divide her Initiative evenly among all foes (rounded up) to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring Hardness.
### Restrain/Drag
The Abyssal can restrain any number of grappled enemies or drag them in the same direction. This costs two rounds of control for each enemy.
### Throw/Slam
The Abyssal can throw or slam any number of grappled enemies in the same direction.
This follows the same rules as savaging attacks.
