*All attempts to strike the deathknight are futile, revealing the meaninglessness of life itself.*
If the Abyssal successfully dodges an attack, she counterattacks with a ({[[Charisma]] or [[Manipulation]]} + [[Dodge]]) roll to instill a Principle expressing her attacker’s despair, helplessness, or insignificance.
If the Abyssal succeeds, her attacker can’t oppose her disengage rolls until the end of her next turn. This costs one [[Willpower]] to resist, separate from resisting the instill roll.
