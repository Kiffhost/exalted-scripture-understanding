*Gripping the reins of her loyal steed, the Solar rides inexorably through the tides of chaos and the uncertain forces that buffet Creation.* 
This Charm allows the Solar to recover from a successful unhorse gambit without falling from the saddle. The Solar is seen to fall from her steed, only to flip in the air or rebound off scenery to reunite with her mount. This Charm is also effective against attacks which would knock the Solar from her mount, but not those which would launch or bodily drag her from the saddle.
