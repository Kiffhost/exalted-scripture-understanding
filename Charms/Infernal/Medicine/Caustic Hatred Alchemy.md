*The Infernal transforms toxins that afflict her patients into poisons of another kind, sparing their lives by filling their hearts with hate.*

The Infernal adds two non-Charm successes on a roll to treat poison. If her patient has any negative Ties, she also adds the strongest Tie’s (Intimacy) non-Charm dice. If she rolls enough successes to reduce the poison’s duration by at least one, she purges it entirely from her patient. He forms a negative Minor Tie toward someone who’s irritated or offended him recently or strengthens an existing Tie by one step.
