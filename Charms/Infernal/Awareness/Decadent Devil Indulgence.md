*The world is set before the Infernal as a banquet of blasphemous desires.*

The Infernal names a desire that involves consuming, destroying, or damaging something from a general class of mundane objects or creatures: drinking a fine wine, strangling a yeddim, carving her name on a satrap’s bedroom walls. She gains a Minor Principle or Tie representing that desire, which can’t be altered or fully removed for this Charm’s duration. She gains the following benefits:
- She instinctively knows if her desire can be readily fulfilled within roughly (Essence) miles.
- She adds +1 Resolve against influence opposed by the Intimacy, but suffers −1 Guile against effects that would reveal it. The bonus and penalty both rise to two if she can directly perceive the object of her desire.
- She can cite the Intimacy in Decision Points even if she used it to bolster her Resolve against the opposing influence.
- She adds (Perception/2, rounded up) dice on Awareness rolls to detect hazards inherent to her desire, such as the poison in a poorly-prepared blowfish, and on Resistance rolls to endure them.
- She adds (Perception/2, rounded up) dice on rolls to introduce or challenge facts related to her desire, its availability, or how to fulfill it. She can do so without needing a Lore background as long as she could plausibly be aware of the introduced fact.

The Infernal can’t end this Charm voluntarily. When she fulfils her desire, this Charm ends and she rolls (Intimacy) dice. Each success grants her one Willpower or lets her lose one Limit. If fulfilling her desire becomes impossible or the current story ends without her fulfilling it, she rolls (Intimacy) dice of Limit and this Charm ends.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by fulfilling the Infernal’s desire.
