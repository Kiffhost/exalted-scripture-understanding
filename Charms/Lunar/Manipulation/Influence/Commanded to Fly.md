Caged and collared, the Lunar finds freedom in obedience. She can use this Charm when she succumbs to a Psyche effect or mind-affecting curse. It still takes effect, but her player adds a stipulation or condition equivalent to an inconvenient or serious task (Exalted, p. 216) to the actions it compels her to take. The imposed condition can’t directly contravene the controlling influence, but may make its dictates more difficult for the Lunar to achieve, or alter the outcome intended by the opposing character. The added condition can’t be one that would let the Lunar ignore the influence as unacceptable. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by successfully completing a task imposed by a Psyche effect or curse in a way that upholds one of the Lunar’s Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] (regardless of whether the outcome is what the opposing character envisioned). Alternatively, it may be reset by completing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134). Example: A Solar uses [[Hypnotic Tongue Technique]] to command Anja Silverclaws to kill a forest-god, the leader of a troublesome spirit court. Anja uses [[Commanded to Fly]] to add the stipulation that she must take the Solar’s shape and carry out the god’s murder while wearing it — a task that’s merely inconvenient, as she has a Charm to take shapes by gambling, and the Solar seems an easy mark. However, if she had a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the Solar, and no way to take his form without killing him, this stipulation would be [[unacceptable influence]], so she couldn’t add it. Likewise, she couldn’t add a stipulation that she kill the god without using any of her Exalted might or weaponry, as the spirit is dangerous enough to make this a life-defining task.
