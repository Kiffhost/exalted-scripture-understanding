*[[Blazerider]] and its master burn with the same fire.*
This Evocation enhances the following Dragon-Blooded [[Charms]] as described below:
 - When the wielder uses [[Bellows-Pumping Stride]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 168) to rush an airborne enemy, she rolls additional dice for her target’s 2s in addition to his 1s.
 - If she uses [[Hopping Firecracker Evasion]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 191) to move toward a nontrivial opponent, she waives its [[Initiative]] cost and can use it against any attack she dodges, regardless of how many successes it missed by.
 - When she uses [[Blinding Spark Throw]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 275) to attack with [[Blazerider]], she can make a damaging decisive attack instead of a gambit, blinding her foe as long as she deals 3+ levels of damage.
 - She can use [[Smoke Burst Eruption]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 276) to enhance a move action, leaving a trail of smoke behind her as she flies, and can use the [[Essence]] 3 repurchase to conceal herself in the smoke after completing her movement if she has it.
