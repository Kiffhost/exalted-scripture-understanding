*The Infernal unleashes pale-white flames of searing truth, burning away a world of lies and treachery.*

The Infernal unleashes a one-time environmental hazard of cosmic flame out to medium range, with difficulty (Perception), Damage (Essence + 3)L. The hazard only affects characters who are disguised, in concealment, or employing similar deceptions — invisibility, illusions, shapeshifting, Sidereals’ resplendent destinies, etc. Trivial characters don’t receive a roll and are automatically incapacitated.

The hazard burns away any disguises worn by damaged characters and breaks their concealment, as well as negating any deceptive magic they benefit from. The flames also burn away ambient or environmental illusions, visual obstructions like mist or smoke, magical concealment applied to inanimate objects or structures, and the like.
