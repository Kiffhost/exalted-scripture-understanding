*The fury of the Infernal’s steed is not easily snuffed out.*

The Infernal can use Brawl and Melee Charms that help defend against attacks on behalf of her mount. This includes counterattacks and clashes in response to attacks against the mount. (The mount makes the attack.) This doesn’t let the two of them use a counterattack together with a clash against the same attack.
