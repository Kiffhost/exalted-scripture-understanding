*The Earth Dragon’s judgment is abrupt and devastating, brooking no response.*
The wielder’s decisive attack channels Earth [[Essence]] into an echoing rebuke. On a hit, the attack’s target is selectively deafened (Exalted, p.168) for (wielder’s Charisma) rounds. He hears only the wielder’s voice, and takes a −2 [[Resolve]] penalty against her. The wielder may end [[Dragons Provide]] upon landing a decisive attack with [[Orison of Thunder]] to explosively detonate the boulder-head of [[Faith’s Pillar]]. This adds up to (lower of [[Strength]] or [[Intimacy|Principle]]) attack roll threshold successes as dice of damage. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost upon joining battle against a nontrivial foe who has violated the [[Intimacy|Principle]] that [[Faith’s Pillar]] is pledged to.
