The Dragon-Blood is one with the air around her, releasing the solidity and substance that weigh down her body. She ignores one point of the penalty for using Stealth in combat, and effects that detect air motion, like Living Pulse Perception (Exalted, p. 271) or the air-aspected variant of All-Encompassing Earth Sense (p. 172), donâ€™t work against her. She can still be detected normally by hearing and other senses. In Air Aura, the Dragon-Blood may ignore (her Essence/2, rounded up) in penalties for using Stealth in combat.
