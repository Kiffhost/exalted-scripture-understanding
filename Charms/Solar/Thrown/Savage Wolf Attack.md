The Solar marks a weapon that has fallen and dares its owner to try and retrieve it. This Charm can only be used after the Solar successfully disarms an opponent with a Thrown disarm gambit, and only if the owner takes a draw/ready weapon action to retrieve the weapon. When he does, he becomes subject to an unblockable, undodgeable withering attack. The Solar hurls this attack at the moment he picks up his weapon, and may make this attack even if she has already attacked in the round. The Solar may only make this attack from close or short range. Savage Wolf Attack may be used once per scene, but can be reset by using a Thrown-based gambit to disarm a crashed opponent.
