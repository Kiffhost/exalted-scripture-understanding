During a clinch the Solar controls with at least two rounds of control remaining, the Lawgiver forces her anima into her hand, gloving it in the scarlet, violet and gold radiance of Solar fire, before driving it into her opponent’s flesh, branding him with the mark of her dominance. This mark is painless and inflicts no damage, but instigates the immediate release of the captive, knocking him prone. So marked, the victim is subject to the Solar’s immediate grasp—when she is in close range of the mark, she may reflexively release the motes committed to the Charm, pulling the opponent back into the clinch. There is no grapple roll, nor a roll to reestablish control; the Exalt resumes control over the captive with the number of rounds of control she had when she branded him. If the Solar does not invoke this power, the brand fades away at the end of the scene and the motes return to her Essence pool. Removing the brand requires that the marked character succeed at a grapple with the Solar and wins at least as many rounds of control as those associated with the brand.
