Violence begets violence. If there is to be an end to the suffering and sorrow which afflicts the world, something must stop this cycle. Drawing the hostile Essence and killing intent of an attack into his defense, the Crane stylist weave an intricate kata to break the flow of her opponent’s aggression. Mournful Crane’s Cry enhances a counterattack, providing a varying effect based on the weapon used to deliver it: 
- Feather-Strewn Path (Unarmed): The martial artist’s unarmed counterattacks turn the momentum of her foe’s attacks against him, tossing him up to two range bands horizontally in any direction at the conclusion of the attack and knocking him prone (assuming it succeeds). The Feather-Strewn Path is a gentle one, and enemies flung by it suffer no further damage when they touch down. 
- Beak Spears Frog (Hook Sword): Using a hook sword to counter with a disarm gambit, the martial artist applies double 9s to the Initiative roll, and halves the Initiative cost of the gambit. 
- Fluttering Wing Flourish (War Fan): Catching an enemy’s weapon on the edge of her war fan, the martial artist sends it back to its master. Instead of making a counterattack, the martial artist rebounds the original attack back on the character who made it. She may still enhance the redirected attack with the Charms of this style, but not any others. This doesn’t actually protect her from the attack, it merely allows her to return its fury to her attacker.
