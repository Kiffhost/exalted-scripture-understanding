*Whispering into a sleeper’s ear, the Lunar fills his dreams with visions of love.*
She makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) instill roll against a sleeping character. If successful, she chooses a trait a person might possess, such as a physical feature, ethnicity, social class, profession, or similar. The next time her victim interacts with someone meeting the description, his attention gravitates toward that character, who involuntarily makes a special ({Appearance or Charisma} + [[Presence]]) instill roll with (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) non-Charm successes against this Charm’s target. The character isn’t aware of this influence. Success instills in the target a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of love toward that character, though the victim’s player chooses whether this is romantic or platonic. A [[Charisma]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to imbue this influence with greater persistence. If an affected character’s [[Resolve]] isn’t overcome by a qualifying character, it recurs the next time he meets someone else fitting this description, up to a maximum number of additional rolls equal to the Lunar’s extra successes. This Charm can only be used on a character once per story.
