*The Lunarâ€™s sensory organs adapt to whatever circumstances she finds herself in.*
She ignores (higher of Essence or 3) points of sensory-related penalties on a roll with any Attribute that would not be negated by [[Sense-Sharpening Change]], such as penalties to eavesdrop through a thick stone wall, shoot an arrow across a mist-covered battlefield, or track a scent through the rain.
If the Lunar uses this Charm while she has [[Sense-Sharpening Change]] enhancing a relevant sense, both [[Charms]] negate all sensory penalties.
