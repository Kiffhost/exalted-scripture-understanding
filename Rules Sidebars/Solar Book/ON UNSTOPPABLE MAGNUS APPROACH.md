Note that any use of this Charm which causes the character to be roleplayed as if she’s aware of Initiative as a resource is illegal per the rules on page 190. This means that if the player defers attacks against an opponent, prolonging combat in order to restore a character’s Willpower, this Charm doesn’t work.
