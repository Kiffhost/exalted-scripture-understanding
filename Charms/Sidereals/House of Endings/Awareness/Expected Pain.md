The Sidereal is burdened with an awareness of the bad things that will happen in her life, realizing what tragedies are about to befall her with only seconds to spare. When the Sidereal’s about to suffer from an unexpected danger or unpleasant occurrence — drinking poison, suffering humiliation, being exposed to a disease, losing a loved one, being betrayed, being sold fraudulent merchandise — the Storyteller should inform her player. She may pay five motes to learn the threat’s general nature and reflexively take an action with any Ability to try to prevent it. If she uses this to attack or move in combat, it counts against the limit on how often she can do so per round. Alternatively, if she uses this Charm in response to an unexpected attack (Exalted, p. 203) — even an ambush — she rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) opposing her attacker’s [[Stealth]] successes. If her attacker used magic to make an unexpected attack without establishing [[Stealth]], the difficulty is that magic’s minimum [[Essence]]. Against surprise attacks, success negates their [[Defense]] penalty. Against ambushes, she can defend normally, but sets her [[Defense]] to 1, plus one for every two extra successes, up to a maximum of her normal base [[Defense]].
