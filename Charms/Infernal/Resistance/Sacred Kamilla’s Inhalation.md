*The Infernal’s breath is like the ragged gasps of Kamilla, the Wind of Promise, who carries away the corpses left in her mother’s wake.*

As the Infernal moves away from one or more inanimate corpses within medium range, they begin to dissolve, like stone eroded by eons of wind. She inhales the wisps of Essence left behind, which are sufficient to let her breathe or hold her breath for one hour for each corpse she inhaled. Multiple uses of this Charm stack this gift of breath.

With Resistance 5, Essence 3, the breath granted by this Charm increases to intervals of days instead of hours.
## [[Keys]]
#### Corpse-Swallowing Storm (Resistance 5, Essence 2) (+2i)
The Infernal can pay a two-Initiative surcharge to also breathe in ghosts and other corporeal undead caught in this Charm’s range. Zombies and other mindless undead are destroyed instantly. Others treat this as a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage (Infernal’s Essence + 2)A. Ghosts are permanently destroyed if they’re incapacitated by this. This hazard doesn’t affect Exalted undead. The Infernal can also inhale inanimate corpses, as above. Each enemy incapacitated by this grants the Infernal (his Essence) hours of breath.
#### Soul-Rending Whirlwind Inhalation ([[#Corpse-Swallowing Storm (Resistance 5, Essence 2) (+2i)|Corpse-Swallowing Storm]]) (1wp)
[[#Corpse-Swallowing Storm (Resistance 5, Essence 2) (+2i)|Corpse-Swallowing Storm]]’s environmental hazard applies to supernatural entities of any kind that are possessing another character, and can permanently destroy possessing spirits. If a possessing entity takes damage, the Infernal can pay one Willpower to draw it out from its host. It can’t possess that character again for the rest of the story.
