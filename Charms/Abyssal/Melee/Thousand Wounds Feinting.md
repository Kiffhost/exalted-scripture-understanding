*The deathknight’s scything rebuke delivers far more than sevenfold vengeance.*
The Abyssal can use [[Charnel Emperor Rebuke]] and [[Coiled Shadow Strike]] against the same attack for a total cost of seven motes, one [[Willpower]], waiving the restrictions of the Counterattack and [[Clash]] keywords. If she wins the clash, she doesn’t roll damage until after Charnel Emperor Rebuke’s counterattack, which adds its decisive damage to the clash attack’s damage roll.
