*The greatest lie ever told is that life has meaning. Next to this, the Abyssal’s deceptions might as well be the sincerest truths.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([Charisma or Manipulation] + [[Performance]]) influence roll, presenting a narrative or an explanation of how something happened. Any penalties she suffers for making implausible claims subtract successes instead of dice. This takes at least a minute, while complex narratives may take longer. The Abyssal can target herself , though doing so causes her to lose one [[Willpower]] if the narrative opposes one of her Intimacies.
Affected characters believe the Abyssal’s narrative or version of events. They can be dissuaded from them with social influence, but gain a [[Resolve]] bonus equal to half the deathknight’s extra successes against them, rounded up, against it. Additionally, such influence fails automatically unless supported by direct evidence. If a victim’s [[Resolve]] is beaten by such influence, this Psyche effect ends. If a roll fails, the victim’s [[Resolve]] bonus is lowered by two, but is immune to further such influence for the rest of the day.
With [[Essence]] 4, the Abyssal can stack up to ([[Essence]]) uses of this Charm on a single character.
With an [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Abyssal may use this Charm for five motes, one [[Willpower]], instantly making a roll against a single target.
