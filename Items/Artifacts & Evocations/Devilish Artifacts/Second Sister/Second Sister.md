“In the course of things, it was inevitable that my misfortunes should lead me to Hell. After departing the Whim of the Wind’s raucous company, I was fortunate, after a fashion, to eventually come to the attention of the demon-citizen Ricimer, who I was flattered to find had read my previous books. They advised me at some length on which demonic notables I had offended in my writings and entreated me for my expert opinion on a suit of armor they had acquired at considerable expense.

The suit was largely of the same velvet-black metal that characterized the demon-smith Alveua’s prodigies, shaped delicately in a woman’s form. The helm bore a serene face for a mask, the breastplate was shrouded in a mail chiton, and the greaves and vambraces were wrought to resemble limbs coiling protectively around the wearer’s own. The right vambrace, though identical to the left in form, was forged from starmetal, a material that the Mistress of the Forge of Night would never deign to use.

Happily, I was able to offer an assessment on the item’s provenance. Several contemporary accounts concerning the Midnight Century tell of the sorceress Nazirem and her unnamed twin bodyguard. During the unnatural strife of that period, her twin was maimed and her sword arm lost. Accounts differ as to whether Nazirem consigned her twin to the Forge of Night, or whether her sister went voluntarily to continue her duty. The Thief of Meru suggests that Nazirem reforged her sister’s broken daiklave to complete the armor, replacing a missing part that corresponded with her sword arm. Though it is avowedly a book of tall tales, it seems in some part accurate.

Ricimer’s gratitude proved short-lived, and though a timely invasion by a rival citizen saved me from execution, the suit somehow vanished in the chaos. The escalating conflict would prove instrumental to my escape from the Demon City. My misadventures there I must relegate to future volumes; suffice it to say that though the experience was singular, I would sooner not return.”
