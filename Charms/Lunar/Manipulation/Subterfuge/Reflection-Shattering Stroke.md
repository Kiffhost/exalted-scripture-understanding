*The Lunar diverts a fatal blow to murder her victim’s reflection, confronting him with his own mortality.*
After incapacitating a character with a decisive attack while his reflection is visible in any surface, she can use this Charm. He’s still incapacitated, but isn’t at risk of dying. Instead, he witnesses his reflection’s death, forming a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward the Lunar (or her current shape). Mortals are left permanently without a reflection; Exalted and other supernatural characters regain theirs once the story ends. The Lunar can draw the slain reflection into reality for one [[Willpower]]. This corpse is a mirror-image of the Lunar’s victim, reversed left-to-right. Noticing this discrepancy requires a ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Medicine}) roll at difficulty (Lunar’s [[Essence]] + [[Manipulation]]), which suffers a −4 penalty if not enhanced by magic or superhuman senses. The corpse bears replicas of everything on the victim’s person, as per forgeries created with [[Reflection-Twisting Theft]], although replicas of artifacts or other magical items function as mundane equivalents.
