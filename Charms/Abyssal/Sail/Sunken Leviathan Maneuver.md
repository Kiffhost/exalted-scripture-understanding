*The deathknight’s flagship descends even to the ocean’s darkest depths, sinking beneath the waves like a predator in wait.*
The Abyssal’s ship can descend into water and sail while immersed, traveling beneath the waves as easily as sailing the open sea. It loses Speed bonuses from wind but can benefit from currents as the water fills its sails. While going straight down, the speed at which it travels is halved, rounded up.
Those aboard the ship are immune to drowning, oceanic pressure, and similar dangers from submersion, as is the ship itself. However, they can still suffer circumstantial penalties from acting underwater, poor visibility in lightless depths, and the like.
In naval combat, the Abyssal reduces the Momentum cost of concealment and escape stratagems by two when her stunt incorporates this Charm’s effect. If she succeeds on a concealment stratagem and uses her next turn to ram an enemy, she deals an additional level of damage.
When this Charm ends, the Abyssal’s vessel surfaces harmlessly after no more than a few minutes unless she renews it with another use.
