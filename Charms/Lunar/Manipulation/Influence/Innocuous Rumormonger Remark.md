The Lunar passes off her arguments as rumors, tantalizing gossip, and popular opinion. When she makes an instill roll, targets can’t bolster their [[Resolve]] with negative Ties toward her. Unless they successfully read her intentions or profile her that scene, they won’t recognize that she attempted to influence them, believing they drew their own conclusions from the widespread gossip.
