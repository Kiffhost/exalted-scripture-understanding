Defying Heaven’s will, the wielder unleashes [[Smiling Yathe]] from his prison.
When the Lunar uses [[Divine Soul-Beast Exaltation]], she can pay ten motes, one [[Willpower]] to manifest [[Smiling Yathe]] instead of her spirit shape. He takes the form of a monstrous scorpion the size of a draft horse with a sky-blue carapace. He’s a spirit, but naturally material.
Yathe receives all of Divine Soul-Beast Exaltation’s benefits and counts as an animal familiar.
While Yathe is manifested, Thousand Venoms Sting’s anima cost is waived.
## Awakening
This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience points. It awakens for free when the wielder and Yathe both have positive Defining Ties to each other. If either of them voluntarily weakens their Tie, the wielder loses access to this Evocation until it’s restored to Defining.
