*Mortal astrologers who try to read the Sidereal’s destiny in the stars are struck blind to her secrets.*
When a character uses magic to scry on the Sidereal from afar or to predict her future, she becomes aware of this and asserts her [[Guile]] against his roll. If the opposing effect is unrolled, that character rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]). If he fails, the Sidereal learns his identity and dictates what his prophesy or scrying reveals. Alternatively, this Charm can negate magic that guarantees some outcome will come to pass, like [[Transcendent Hatchet of Fate]] (p. XX). If such an effect would harm or impede the Sidereal, an employee of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], or someone the Sidereal has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] for, she becomes aware of the effect and the identity of the character responsible. If she wins a notable victory over him — defeating him in combat, turning the audience against him in a debate, driving his business bankrupt — that effect is negated. Seers and Shrikes [[Stab the Seer’s Eye]] is intended to oppose magic like God-King Shrike, but the Storyteller should be judicious in introducing Sidereal opposition. If the players want to try to wipe the Imperial City off the map, they should expect to face Bronze Faction opposition — potentially the likes of Chejop Kejak — but there’s not a Sidereal for every possible disaster. The Storyteller should warn players if a particular prediction is likely to draw Heaven’s notice.
