*The deathknight savors her enemy’s despair in the face of an invincible foe After dodging an attack with [[Wraith-Form Avoidance]], the Abyssal is suffused with dark power. She gains one [[Initiative]], plus an additional [[Initiative]] at the start of each turn. She loses this benefit if she’s hit by an attack, enters concealment, or is at long range or further from all enemies.*
