The Dragon-Blood commands the skies themselves, callingdownboltsoflightningtosmiteherenemiesand darkening the horizon with storm clouds that precede her armies. This Charm creates a unique magical stratagem with threshold 3 to manipulate weather, forcing the enemy to contend with storms or similarly perilous atmospheric conditions. Once the Dragon-Blood Joins Battle against the opposing army, the harsh weather culminates in a thunderstorm, gale-force wind, heavy snowfall, or other extreme weather. This imposes a −3 environmental penalty on all physical actions that enemy battle groups take in combat. Non–battle group enemies may suffer a −1 environmental penalty on appropriate actions. The weather doesn’t impede the Dragon-Blood or her allies. At the beginning of each round, if the Dragon-Blood has 12+ Initiative, she may pay five Initiative to reflexively create an instantaneous environmental hazard targeting a single battle group — a bolt of lightning, an avalanche, or similar dangers. This hazard has difficulty (higher of Essence or Intelligence) and Damage (Willpower)L. If this deals enough Magnitude damage to reduce the battle group to Size 0, the Dragon-Blood gains one point of temporary Willpower. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a cumulative total bonus of +4 on a Strategic Maneuver roll from any combination of non-magical sources.
