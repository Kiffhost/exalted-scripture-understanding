*The Feverfear Guise is a plague-mask of sleek, swooping black leather, set with lenses framed in soulsteel and stitched with behemoth-sinew.*
History records its creator as the Visitor, an opportunistic Ghost-Blooded physician whose true name was lost in the turbulent dawn of the [[Great Contagion]]. He was, by chance, among those lucky few to survive the Contagion and become immune against it. He was, by choice, a charlatan who fattened his purse off the hopes and fears of the plague-ridden communities he visited. Vestiges of his soul and malicious cunning tarry still in the mask’s soulsteel-shod beak, which sometimes shrieks with a noise like the distant cry of carrion birds.
Some of the mask’s subsequent wearers have been liars in the mold of its original owner, while others have turned it to nobler aim. The merchant prince Siulé donned the mask and took the name of the Visitor to extort the city-states of Kesitha with their fear of the Contagion’s return, absconding after ten years of terror to live in wretched splendor. For Jaspinder of the Saffron Bough, the mask was a tool of grim instruction, lending gravity to her warnings in her campaign against the five great diseases that had long plagued her people.
