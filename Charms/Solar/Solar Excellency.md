The Solar Exalted may use their Excellencies to enhance any [[Dice Rolls|rolled]] [[action]], or any application of a static value (such as [[Defense]] or [[Resolve]]). To enhance a rolled action, the Solar simply spends 1 mote of Essence per die added to the roll. The Solar may spend up to (Attribute + Ability) motes, subject to the normal limitations on adding dice to a roll with magic ([[Charms#Charm Limitations]]). When using an Excellency to enhance a static value, the Solar spends 2 motes of Essence for every point by which she raises the static value, and may spend up to (Attribute + Ability that contributes to the static value) motes, again, subject to normal static value-raising limitations. If the Excellency is being used to enhance a dice roll it is considered supplemental. If it is being used in a defense it is considered reflexive. 

Note: Dice limit of appropriate [[Charms#Charm Style]].
