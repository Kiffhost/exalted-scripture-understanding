Imprimatur’s keen edge and social license work as one, empowering the wielder to swat aside errant blades and poisonous words with equal ease. The wielder reflexively clashes a decisive attack from close range with a disarm gambit, adding (Renown) bonus dice on the attack roll. [[Attack]] roll threshold successes are added to her [[Initiative]] roll. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. Alternatively, the wielder may oppose another character’s influence roll with her own ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) roll, adding (Renown) bonus dice. If successful, the wielder’s repartee leaves the target stunned silent. He’s unable to attempt another influence roll until he’s able to compose himself with a miscellaneous action. She gains one [[Willpower]] from her triumph. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by going a round without either being hit by an attack or having one’s [[Resolve]] beaten.
