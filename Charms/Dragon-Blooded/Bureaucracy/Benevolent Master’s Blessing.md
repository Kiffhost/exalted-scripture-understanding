The Dragon-Blood marks a subordinate with a sign of her authority, often handing out a badge or token, or leaving a swirling black tattoo of Water Essence on his hand. If the subordinate presents the token or mark, all who see it know instinctively that he’s the Dragon-Blood’s servant (or, if they don’t know of her, the servant of a Prince of the Earth), and that he carries authority to negotiate on her behalf. In addition, that character gains a temporary Bureaucracy specialty that applies on rolls to follow the Dragon-Blood’s orders or pursue her best interests.
