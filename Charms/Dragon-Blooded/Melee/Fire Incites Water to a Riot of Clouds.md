Water vapor or rain boils into steam as the arc of the Dragon-Blood’s attack agitates them with ferocious Essence, whipping a great cloud from the air as she intercepts her enemy’s blow. She may reflexively clash an attack against her with a withering attack, without it counting as her attack for the round. She doesn’t gain any Initiative from the damage roll, but a successful clash creates a steam cloud that spreads out to close range from her enemy, plus an additional range band for every five points of withering damage dealt to him. Any of the Dragon-Blood’s allies that are within the steam cloud gain one point of Initiative for every 10 on her damage roll. The cloud remains for the rest of the scene, or until dispersed by strong winds or magic. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack while at 15+ Initiative in either Fire or Water Aura.
