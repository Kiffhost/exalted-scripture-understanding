*Crowned in hellfire, the Infernal will not bend before pain or horror.*

The Infernal adds +1 Resolve and ignores up to (Stamina/2, rounded up) points of wound penalties, penalties from fear-based Intimacies, or other penalties based on pain or fear. This can’t reduce a Resolve penalty from an Intimacy penalty by more than one point.

The Infernal can also use this Charm to enhance her Guile against effects that would reveal one of her fear-based Intimacies or otherwise expose her fears.
