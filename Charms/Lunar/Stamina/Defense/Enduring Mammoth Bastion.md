*The Lunar shrugs off spearpoints and arrows, her skin unmarked even by those that strike true.*
When determining if her [[Hardness]] prevents damage from a decisive attack, her attacker compares only his Initiative to her Hardness, without considering damage dice added by other sources. If his attack’s damage roll doesn’t include his [[Initiative]] due to magic, he compares the lower of his damage dice or his actual [[Initiative]] to the Lunar’s [[Hardness]]. If the Lunar is unarmored, waive this Charm’s [[Initiative]] cost.
