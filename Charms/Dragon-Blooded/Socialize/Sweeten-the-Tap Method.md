Whether it’s freely flowing libations at a Dynastic salon or a ration of rum at a military encampment, alcohol improves moods and eases social friction. When the Dragon-Bloodsuppliesdrinks,shemayusethisCharmtoheighten their potency and quality. Each character who partakes is treated as having a positive Minor Tie for his fellow partygoers—whosecontext,suchasaffectionorcamaraderie,is chosen by his player — and suffers −1 [[Guile]]. However, sweetening the tap also increases the risk of fraying tempers or violent overreactions. If a character botches a social action, the positive Tie towards him created by this Charm inverts into a negative Tie for all inebriated partygoers who witnessed the offense.
