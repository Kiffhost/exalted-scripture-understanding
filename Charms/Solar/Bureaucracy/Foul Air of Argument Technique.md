*The Lawgiver can arrest an entire arm of government with one deft stroke.*
The Solar targets a project she’s aware of and dooms it with a flash of her Caste Mark. Roll ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Bureaucracy]]) against the [[Bureaucracy]], [[Investigation]], [[Larceny]] or [[War]] (whichever is applicable to the project) of each character responsible for leading the project. For each success, that character will experience (Solar’s [[Essence]]) botches trying to carry out that project. As failure manifests, the first result is that communication breaks down, becoming hostile, ineffective, or completely impossible (as with the collapse of the information arm of a military establishment). A project that is a monumental failure may threaten the stability of an entire organization. This Charm may not be used on a single organization more than once per season.
