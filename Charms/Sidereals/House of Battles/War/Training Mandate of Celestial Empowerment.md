The Sidereal weaves the fates of her soldiers into a great lash, tilting the odds of every battle in their favor. The Sidereal spends a month training a battle group of up to Size (Intelligence). It permanently gains the following benefits: 
-  Its Drill increases by one step. 
-  +1 Might (maximum 2) against enemies of fate. 
-  If one of its members benefits from the Sidereal’s Auspicious (Caste) Horoscopes, the entire battle group receives its benefit. 
-  Its members are immune to the Sidereal’s arcane fate for as long as they serve under her. This Charm can’t train Exalted, player characters, or others who are inappropriate for inclusion in battle groups.
