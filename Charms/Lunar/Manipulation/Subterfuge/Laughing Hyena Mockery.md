*The Lunar exhausts the patience of saints and provokes the wise to folly.*
The Lunar makes a withering attack against the [[Resolve]] of an enemy who can perceive her, rolling ([[Manipulation]] + {Performance, [[Presence]], or Socialize}), with an [[Accuracy]] bonus of ([[Essence]], maximum 5). Its raw damage is ([[Appearance]] + [[Charisma]] + [[Manipulation]] + extra successes) and it has Overwhelming ([[Essence]], maximum 5). It can be enhanced both by magic that enhances inspire rolls, as well as attacks. An enemy crashed by this attack loses one [[Willpower]].
Note that this Charm’s range is based on the target’s ability to hear the Lunar’s words or see her nonverbal displays. Under normal conditions, it can’t affect characters at long range, and can only target characters at medium range if the Lunar shouts.
