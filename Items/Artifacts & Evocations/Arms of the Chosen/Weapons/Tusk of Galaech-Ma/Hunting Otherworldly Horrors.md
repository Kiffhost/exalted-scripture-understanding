*In a Lawgiver’s hands, the Tusk delivers holy retribution to the unnatural things that stalk humanity.*
This Evocation upgrades [[Sharp Light of Judgment Stance]] (Exalted, pp. 352-353), letting the Solar count her quarry as a creature of darkness (without incurring the additional cost against hated creatures). If she’s chosen a creature of darkness as her quarry, she adds one nonCharm bonus success to attack rolls against it.
