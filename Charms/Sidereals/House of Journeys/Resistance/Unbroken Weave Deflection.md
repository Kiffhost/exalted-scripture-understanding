*Weapons ring and ricochet off the Sidereal’s iron fate.*
The Sidereal clashes an attack against her with a (Stamina + Resistance) disarm gambit. Ranged attacks and unarmed attacks can be clashed, but attackers aren’t disarmed and the Sidereal doesn’t pay Initiative.
While using Forward-Thinking Technique, the Sidereal can clash ambushes with this Charm. She can use Charms to enhance the clash attack normally, but she can’t use other Charms to defend against the ambush.
