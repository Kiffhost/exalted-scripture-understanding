The concentrated Essence of flame limns the edge of the Exalt’s weapon and burns in her enemy’s blood and soul, searing away his fighting spirit. She makes a withering attack, burning away an extra point of her foe’s Initiative for every 10 on the damage roll, which she doesn’t gain. The victim suffers this Initiative loss again on each of his next (Essence) turns, or until he damages the Dragon-Blood with a withering attack.
