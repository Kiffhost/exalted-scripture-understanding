The divine predator uncovers her prey’s weaknesses. The Lunar makes a special read intentions or profile character roll. If successful, the Storyteller reveals that character’s most significant weakness to the Lunar’s player:syphilisplaguingamasterswordsman,aDynast’s overwhelming debts, a merchant prince’s poor reputation, a Wyld monstrosity’s vulnerability to ash wood, etc. She may seek to find a character’s greatest weakness in general, or in a specific arena. However, there must be evidence, no matter how scant, from which she can infer this information. She gains a temporary specialty in exploiting this weakness in an Ability of her choice. It lasts indefinitely, but she can only have one specialty granted by this Charm at a time. 
## Protean 

In shapes that her target has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward, the Lunar can use [[Exquisite Heart’s Taste]] at no cost to penalize his [[Guile]] with that [[Intimacy]].
