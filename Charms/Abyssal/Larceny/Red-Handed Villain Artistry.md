*The Abyssal leaves a macabre signature for investigators, whether a grisly message written in blood or a rose left in place of stolen treasures, stirring both revulsion and obsession.*
When the Abyssal leaves behind a message, calling card, or other distinctive signature as part of a [[conceal evidence]] roll, she adds ([[Charisma]] or [[Manipulation]]) dice. Her roll also counts as an influence roll against anyone who cases the scene. By default, this can either be a threaten roll or an instill roll to create Ties of obsession, hatred, or morbid fascination with the crime’s perpetrator, but the [[Storyteller]] can allow other rolls that fit the deathknight’s crime scene.
If an investigator’s [[Resolve]] is beaten by the Abyssal’s influence, his [[case scene]] roll suffers a penalty equal to her threshold successes, minimum (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]), and his 1s subtract successes, even if he spends [[Willpower]] to resist. Failure represents the target being so fixated on the Abyssal’s grisly signature or his preconceptions about the suspect that he overlooks actual evidence.
