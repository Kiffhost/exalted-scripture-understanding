*If love of justice will not sway the guilty, then fear of Death’s Lawgiver must suffice.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([[Wits]] + [[Investigation]]) threaten roll to interrogate a character. If successful, her target must answer one question truthfully and to fully, plus an additional question for each of her extra successes. He can refuse to answer or give a false response by paying one [[Willpower]] per question.
If the Abyssal’s victim escapes her presence, he doesn’t have to answer any further questions. In combat, enemies can refuse to answer without spending [[Willpower]], but may still answer at the Storyteller’s discretion, especially if they have a relevant [[Intimacy]].
## Reset
