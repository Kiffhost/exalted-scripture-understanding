*As the Dragon-Blood takes aim, her arrow crackles with gathering lightning, shining as a glowing anima banner (p.*
154). On her next turn, she may make a decisive attack, adding the bonus from aiming to her damage roll instead of the attack roll. An [[Archery]] 4, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Dragon-Blood expend her Aura to apply the aim bonus on both the attack and damage rolls.
