Once per night, the necromancer may perform a ceremonial [[sacrifice]] to a powerful ancestor or group of ghosts, rolling ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) at difficulty (5 â€“ [[Resources]] value of her [[sacrifice]]). She may instead offer up to a maximum of five [[Health Track|Health Levels]] worth of blood freshly drawn from herself or another in place of material [[sacrifice]], using the number of health levels in place of a Resources value. She gains ([[Essence]] + extra successes) necromantic motes, which last until the story ends or she makes another offering.
