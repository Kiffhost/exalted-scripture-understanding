*“Long after we are gone, the world will bear witness again, if only for a moment.”*

This Evocation can only be used in the instant the wearer’s anima reaches bonfire, replacing her iconic display with a mesmerizing image of Itreyoun. She increases [[Forgotten Woven Dreams]]’ penalty to (Essence) against enemies whose Resolve she’s beaten or who suffer an Obsession.

At the start of each of the wearer’s turns, she reflexively makes an (Appearance + {Performance or Presence}) inspire roll against everyone who can see her, conveying the same effect as [[Embrace of Bygone Stories]]. If a character is simultaneously affected both by this Charm and [[Embrace of Bygone Stories]], he cannot flurry the action to stare at Itreyoun’s image.

Characters can avoid this influence by averting their eyes for this Evocation’s duration, suffering a −3 penalty on vision-based actions against the wearer, including attacks.

This Evocation ends if the wearer’s anima falls below bonfire.
### Dissonant
Instead of increasing [[Forgotten Woven Dreams]]’ penalty, this Evocation removes its Dissonant effect.
