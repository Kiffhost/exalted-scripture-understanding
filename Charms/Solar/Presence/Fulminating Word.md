When the Lawgiver argues from one of her defining principles, it is nearly impossible to disagree. Her words sow dissent within a target’s soul. Upon successfully beating a target’s [[Resolve]] with a bargain, threaten or persuade action, but before a Decision Point has been entered, she may activate this Charm to magnify the impact of her argument. Doing so raises the cost of the Decision Point to two [[Willpower]]. If the target acquiesces to the Solar’s demands, then the Exalt gains a point of temporary [[Willpower]] when she realizes her success.
