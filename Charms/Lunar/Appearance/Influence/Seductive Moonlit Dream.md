*The Lunar embodies passion, drawing eyes and weakening wills.*
She doubles 9s on an [[instill]] roll to create a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of lust or attraction toward herself (or her current form), or a [[persuade]] or [[bargain]] roll for seduction.
## Protean
Characters with [[Intimacy|Ties]] of lust, love, desire, etc. toward the Lunarâ€™s current human shape treat their [[Resolve]] as 1 lower when determining how many bonus dice her [[Appearance]] adds (Exalted, p. 218).
