*Death’s Lawgiver calls icy mist to encircle her steed, leaving the chill of the grave in her wake.*
The Abyssal adds an automatic success on a mounted rush, disengage, or withdraw, while the bitter chill she exudes forces enemies to reroll a successful die for each 1 they roll, starting with their 7s and moving up. This Charm can also be used in mounted races and other opposed rolls representing contests of speed.
The Abyssal can pay a one-mote, one-anima surcharge to leave a trail of freezing mist in her wake. Characters who fail their roll opposing her movement are exposed to this environmental hazard, which has difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round. The mist takes one hour to dissipate, even in the strongest wind. Anything killed by it is frozen solid.
