*The [[Night Hag’s Braid]] draws power from the fevered visions of those under its curse.*
When a cursed enemy’s roll is penalized by his 6s, the wielder gains one curse point for each success subtracted from his roll, up to a maximum of ([[Essence]] + [[Occult]]) total. She can spend curse points on spells as though they were sorcerous motes. At the end of the scene, all curse points are lost.
With an [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the wielder can spend curse points as though they were motes to pay the costs of this weapon’s [[Evocations]] and of any magic that enhances an [[Occult]] roll.
A third purchase, also at [[Essence]] 2, lets the wielder spend four curse points in place of one [[Willpower]] for one of the above effects or for spells.
