*Death’s Lawgiver wields secrets like a weapon, demanding obedience from the wayward lest she reveal their misdeeds.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([[Perception]] + [Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Socialize]) read intention roll with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes. Success reveals whatever [[Intimacy]] her target most desires to keep hidden. If there’s something relevant that he’s hiding but he doesn’t have a related [[Intimacy]], the [[Storyteller]] can reveal a piece of information about it instead.
If the Abyssal successfully uses this Charm against someone who’s unaware of her and then breaks concealment to reveal herself, she steals one [[Willpower]] from him.
## Special activation rules
Hidden Eye Inquisition’s cost is waived when used with this Charm.
