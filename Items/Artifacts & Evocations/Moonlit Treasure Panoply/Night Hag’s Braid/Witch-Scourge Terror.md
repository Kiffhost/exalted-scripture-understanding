The Lunar witch can weave many curses into the [[Night Hag’s Braid]].
The Lunar can use [[Night Hag’s Braid]] instead of touching an enemy with the following [[Charms]] (Lunars, pp. 207, 232-233), gaining additional benefits when she does so:
[[Devil’s-Eye Brand]]: Once per day, the Lunar may waive this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost. Against a cursed enemy, the difficulty of the required gambit is reduced to 3.
Each success subtracted from his opposed roll by the curse increases the transformation’s length by one hour (or one day, with the Charm’s [[Essence]] 3 effect).
[[Insidious Lunar Transformation]]: This Charm’s health level cost is waived. Against a cursed enemy, the difficulty of the required gambit is reduced to 3. Each success subtracted from his opposed roll by the curse increases the transformation’s length by one day.
Enemies affected by either Charm count as being cursed for [[Evocations]] like [[Baleful Omen Strike]].
