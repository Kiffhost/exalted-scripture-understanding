The Lunar draws inspiration from all aspects of life, honing creative genius with holistic experience. She gains craft points for meeting basic objectives as though she’d completed a basic project (Exalted, p. 240) when she successfully: 
-  Introduces or challenges a fact relating to one of her Craft Abilities. 
-  Provides medical treatment using equipment or medicine she crafted. 
-  Navigates through wilderness or sea using tools she crafted, or uses such tools to withstand hardships on such a journey. 
-  Tattoos a Casteless Lunar (p. XX). As usual, if the Lunar succeeds with 3+ threshold successes, she gains three silver points per objective fulfilled. Example: Blue Scribe introduces the fact that the Vayashi Forest is known for medicinal flora, relating to his Craft (Poisons) Ability. This upholds his Tie of pride for the region, and causes his Solar mate, the beastman Relentless, to strengthen a Tie of respect toward him. Because he met two basic objectives, he gains four silver points.
