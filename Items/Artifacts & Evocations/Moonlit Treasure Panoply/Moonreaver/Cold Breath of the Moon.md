The othermoon’s icy winds are loosed into Creation as [[Moonreaver]] cuts the boundary between worlds.
The othermoon’s chill adds one die of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage to an attack. If it deals any decisive damage or 5+ withering damage, it inflicts a −2 environmental penalty on all rolls its target takes until the end of his next turn.
This penalty doesn’t stack. Instead, for enemies affected by a subsequent use, the penalty doesn’t expire at the end of their next turn, but at the end of the turn he takes after that one.
## Resonant
The penalty is −3.

# MOONREAVER’S PENALTIES 
The penalties inflicted by [[Beneath a Strange Sky]] and [[Moonlit Horizon Reaper]] count for [[Evocations]] that gain additional benefits against enemies penalized by [[Cold Breath of the Moon]].
