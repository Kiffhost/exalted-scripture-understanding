*The Lunar sheds her soul’s light, a will-o’-the-wisp that leads pursuers astray.*
When she would gain anima, she can displace those levels onto a character within medium range marked with [[Devil’s-Eye Brand]], committing two motes per level. Un-Exalted victims manifest the Lunar’s own anima, with her distinctive colors and iconic display; Exalted victims instead flare their own anima banners. The victim’s false [[Tell]] becomes impossible to conceal while his anima level is glowing or higher, and he suffers the normal [[Stealth]] penalties (p. XX); un-Exalted victims gain no benefits from this anima banner. Characters whose anima is already at bonfire can’t be affected. If the Lunar ends this Charm before her victim’s anima banner has fully subsided, or if the false [[Tell]] fades before that, all displaced levels of anima return to her, adding to her own. If the Lunar uses this Charm multiple times in the same scene to displace her anima onto the same character, she waives the [[Willpower]] cost of subsequent activations.
