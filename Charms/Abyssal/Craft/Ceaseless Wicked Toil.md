*The Abyssal’s hands are never idle, leaving her prepared for every contingency.*
The Abyssal reveals that she’s previously created a mundane object and has it on her, rolling (Wits + Craft) at a difficulty of the object’s Resources rating. She must have a Craft appropriate to the object, and the object must be something she could have feasibly kept hidden on her.
On a successful roll, the revealed item counts as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580). The Abyssal gains craft points as though she’d completed a basic project (Exalted, p. 240), even if the object would normally require a major project.
On failure, the Abyssal still produces the object, but it suffers a flaw determined by the ### Storyteller
a −1 penalty on all uses, falling apart at end of scene, etc. She doesn’t gain craft points.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can use Magnificent Cenotaph Allure or Five-Fold Malice Curse when she uses this Charm to confer their effects on the revealed object. These Charms use the result of Ceaseless Wicked Toil’s roll instead of their own.
## Reset
Once per scene.
