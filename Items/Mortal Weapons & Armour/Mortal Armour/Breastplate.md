Nothing more than a pair of fitted metal plates that cover the character’s chest and back, this armor provides excellent protection for the character’s vitals. Breastplates are common among military officers and scouts, both of whom need more protection than a [[Items/Mortal Weapons & Armour/Mortal Armour/Chain Shirt]] offers but still need a full range of motion.
