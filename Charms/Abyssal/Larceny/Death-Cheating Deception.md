*Having cheated death once, it is a small matter to do so again.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she’s incapacitated or would suffer death for any reason. Any damage that would fill her Incapacitated health level is negated, as are other fatal effects. Her anima fades to dim, and she immediately joins battle with ([[Wits]] + [[Larceny]]), ignoring her wound penalty, and gains a pool of motes equal to twice her successes. These motes can only be spent on [[Dodge]], [[Larceny]], and [[Stealth]] [[Charms]] to aid in avoiding or escaping the present danger, and are lost if not spent by the end of the scene.
This also counts as a roll to enter concealment if the Abyssal’s current location affords her a suitable hiding spot, or if there’s one within close range. If it’s the latter, the Abyssal reflexively moves to it, without using her movement action. Onlookers who she hides from are convinced that they saw her die.
