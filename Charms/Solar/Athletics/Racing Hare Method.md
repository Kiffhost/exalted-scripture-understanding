Attuned to Essence currents that flow through the world, the Solar moves as if in a waking dream. She travels in flashing sprints and sparking leaps, moving from branch to branch like a skipping stone and leaving dust clouds in her wake. This Charm lasts one hour. During this hour, the Solar moves up to three range bands per turn, depending on the terrain and her ability to move at an uninterrupted clip. If she joins battle, her speed is greatly slowed, as she must focus more completely on her environment. The Solar resumes moving one range band per turn, but the Charm still has an effect: double 9s on rush attempts, and for every 10 rolled on a rush, the Solar gains a point of Initiative. If the Exalt knows the Charm Triumph-Forged God-Body, the rushes instead gain (Essence) bonus dice. These benefits also apply to each interval of a test of speed. If the Lawgiver chooses to renew this technique at the end of an hour, ignore the Willpower cost.
