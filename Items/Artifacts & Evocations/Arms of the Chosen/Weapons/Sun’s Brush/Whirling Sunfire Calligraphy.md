Reviving the god-artist Arajati’s legendary talent, the Solar paints with the light of the sun. [[Sun’s Brush]] glows with blinding radiance as tongues of sunfire stream from its blade. When she rolls to introduce a fact, she also treats it as an influence roll to threaten all enemies that see her, cowing them with her superior knowledge. The ignited [[Sun’s Brush]] adds her ([[Intelligence]]) to the raw damage of withering attacks, and to decisive damage rolls. When she would make a foe-scribing gambit, she may make a regular decisive attack instead, applying the gambit’s effect as long as her damage roll successes meet its difficulty. An enemy that takes decisive damage catches fire, suffering five dice of lethal damage that ignore [[Hardness]] on each turn until it’s extinguished. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by [[introducing a fact]] that allows the wielder or an ally to fulfill a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134). The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
