*The Abyssal has a sixth sense for danger, eerily prescient in matters of life and death.*
When the Abyssal makes an Awareness roll to detect a hidden enemy or other danger, she adds a non-Charm success. She gains one mote for each 9 she rolls and two motes for each 10. This can’t exceed the number of motes spent enhancing the roll.
Additionally, the Abyssal can make Awareness rolls while asleep, unconscious, or incapacitated, suffering no penalties for doing so. She may awaken instantly upon successfully detecting a threat or even revive herself from unconsciousness if incapacitated, though she still suffers the effects of incapacitation.
