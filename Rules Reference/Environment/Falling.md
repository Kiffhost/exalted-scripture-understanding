Arguably an [[Environmental Hazards|environmental hazard]].

Sometimes you don’t need fire, acid, or the killing winds of Hell to put an end to a hero—gravity is more than able to do the job. For whatever reason, Exalts seem particularly prone to reckless acrobatics near long drops. 

Falls in Exalted are evaluated by how many range bands the character falls before hitting the ground. Characters facing falling damage suffer a number of levels of automatic damage, as well as a number of dice of damage. All such damage ignores [[soak]] and [[hardness]] and is applied directly to a character’s [[Health Track]], as though it were a [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack]].

| Fall    | Damage Levels | Damage Dice  |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Close   | None          | None         |
| Short   | 3 Bashing     | 5 Bashing    |
| Medium  | 4 Lethal      | 7 Bashing    |
| Long    | 5-7 Lethal    | 8-12 Lethal  |
| Extreme | 7-10 Lethal   | 10-14 Lethal |
It’s often a good idea to give characters who can come up with a good [[stunt]] an opportunity to make a roll to avoid or mitigate a deadly drop—perhaps they manage to land on something softer than the unforgiving earth, or stab a dagger into a ship’s sails to slow themselves down before impact.
