First Age Lunars took up their Solar mates’ arms in times of need, wielding the power of their sacred bond. Now, the Chosen of Sun and Moon may find new cause to share their treasures. The Lunar attunes an artifact that her Solar mate is attuned to without disrupting his attunement, reducing her attunement cost to zero. Their bonds to the artifact become immune to effects that break attunement. If the Lunar’s Solar mate is resonant with the artifact, she’s treated as resonant with it for any [[Evocations]] she uses that her Solar mate has also awakened. The first time the Lunar uses this Charm on an artifact, she rolls ([[Wits]] + [Craft, [[Lore]], or Occult]) against (artifact’s rating + 2; 10 if N/A). Every two extra successes awakens an Evocation that her Solar mate has already mastered as long as she meets its prerequisites, permanently granting it to her at no experience point cost. If she crafted the artifact for her Solar mate, she may awaken [[Evocations]] he’s yet to master, granting them to both him and herself if they both qualify. This Charm can only be used once per story. Using it on an artifact the Lunar has already used it on doesn’t count against this limit.
