There are oceans of blood yet to be shed in destiny’s service; what is one drop more compared to the Sidereal’s duty? The Sidereal can use this Charm after an attack roll against her or other roll to resist damage, but before the damage roll. She speaks the name of a trivial character she’s interacted with this story. She automatically defends against all damage or other harm from it; a few seconds later, that person’s heart stops.
