*The Infernal rouses strange dreams of things that never were from the depths of slumber, revealing a beauty antithetical to the order of the world.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Appearance or Charisma} + Performance) inspire roll against a single character. If successful, a twisted inspiration takes root within the target’s mind. The next time he sleeps, his dreams are disturbingly vivid, granting him a pool of (1 + Infernal’s extra successes) bonus dice as well as a Minor Derangement chosen by his player. He doesn’t recover Willpower for the night’s sleep.

The inspired character can add up to (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) dice from this pool on any Craft, Linguistics, or Performance roll that he makes involving creativity. Whatever he creates with such rolls takes on aesthetic qualities of Hell’s artistry or artifice, which he recognizes only from his dreams.

When the inspired character sleeps, his player may choose to add three dice back to the pool instead of recovering Willpower as nightmares trouble his sleep. He also regains one die each time he fails a Willpower roll against the Derangement. These can’t bring him above the amount of dice initially granted by this Charm.

The inspired character can pay one Willpower to free himself of the Derangement if he has no bonus dice remaining or if (Infernal’s Essence) days have passed since she used this Charm.

The Infernal can only have one character inspired with this Charm at a time.
