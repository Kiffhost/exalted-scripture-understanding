Moving in bounding leaps or nimble cartwheels, the stylist maneuvers freely across the battlefield to strike.
The stylist moves two range bands horizontally or jumps or climbs one range band vertically. She may make a single decisive attack or disarm or distract gambit at any point during this movement. She can take the movement and attack in any order — dashing two range bands toward an enemy to attack, moving into close range to attack and then falling back, etc. This counts as her attack and movement action for the round.
Using this Charm to leave close range with an enemy the stylist’s used Flowing Mirror of Opposition on doesn’t end that Charm as long as the stylist ends her movement back within close range of him.

## Mastery
The stylist can jump or climb two range bands vertically. She doesn’t suffer falling damage from leaping attacks.

## Terrestrial
The stylist can’t make damaging decisive attacks.
