*The Lunar’s song beckons pack and pride to fight for Creation.*
She adds ([[Performance]]) non-Charm dice on rolls with [[Wild Fury Awakening]] (p. XX) and PackCalling Cry (p. XX). The natural weapons of animals beckoned by either Charm count as iron against fae. If the Lunar knows [[Cold Iron Cadence]], she may activate [[Battle Anthem of the Lunar Exalted]] reflexively when she activates [[Wild Fury Awakening]]. 

## Resonant

Each turn while playing [[Night’s Sweet Whisper]], the Lunar can reflexively take one Charismabased command action targeting a battle group assembled with [[Wild Fury Awakening]].
