The Lunar becomes one with the Shadow Moth Raiment, her body dissolving into dark-winged moths and reforming with fluid grace as she masters Daraya Nightbloom’s ultimate technique.
The Lunar gains the following benefits:
 - She can fly, partially dissolving and rising on many wings. She can move through the air in any direction with her movement actions and can hover in place while not moving.
 - When attacked, her body dissolves to let weapons pass through it. 1s on attack rolls against her Evasion subtract successes — both from the attack roll itself, and from the damage roll, if it hits. This doesn’t apply against firewands, area-of-effect attacks, and similar attacks that aren’t impeded by dispersing into moths.
 - Her form is blurry and indistinct, constantly shifting between flesh and moth. Perceptionbased rolls opposing her suffer a three-success penalty.
 - She waives the Initiative surcharges of Moth Shroud Feint and Shadow-Wing Escape’s repurchase effects.

## Special activation rules
Once per scene, the wearer can reflexively enter Thousand Twilit Wings Form.
