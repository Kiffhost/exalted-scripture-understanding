*The Abyssal’s otherworldly nature is made obvious to the beasts of Creation, evoking their most primal fears.*
Animals count as having a Minor Tie of fear toward the Abyssals, and she adds two automatic successes on threaten rolls against them. Any social influence she uses against animals doesn’t face the [[Resolve]] bonuses for lacking a shared language. Most animals will give her a wide berth, refusing to approach unless forced by a handler or rider.
Familiars and other magically-enhanced animals don’t suffer the Tie inflicted by this Charm, though its other effects apply against them. The same is true for animals trained for battle or that are driven to aggression by pain, hunger, or disease.
With [[Survival]] 4, the Abyssal extends this Charm’s effects to hungry ghosts, as if they were normal animals.
Undead Animals Undead animals include both the ghosts of animals and the reanimated corpses of animals. They count as animals for these [[Charms]] and other magic, but count as being magically-enhanced animals.
