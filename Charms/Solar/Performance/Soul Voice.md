Calling upon the divine other, the Solar dwells in the temple of her body like a burning icon. Activating this Charm reduces the cost of all the Lawgiverâ€™s [[Performance]] [[Charms]] to zero motes for one performance. This Charm may be used once per day, but may be reset when the Storyteller introduces a major element to the scene that changes a scene for the worse, such as the sudden arrival of Immaculate monks mid-performance.
