*Metal screams out against metal as the deathknight’s foes strike, but she remains unmoved behind her dreaded mail.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm against a withering damage roll against her, reducing the amount of [[Initiative]] she loses by (higher of [[Essence]] or 3). This is increased by +1 while wearing medium armor or +2 with heavy armor. Her attacker still gains [[Initiative]] as usual.
While using [[Iron Tomb Imprisonment]], the bonus from the Abyssal’s armor increases by +1.
