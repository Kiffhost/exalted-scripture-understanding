Across Creation, sorcerers are known and feared as figures of great and dangerous power, said to be capable of slaying a man with a gesture or calling up storms with a glance. The magic of [[sorcery]] is fundamentally different from [[Charms]]. A Charm is an expression of the Exalt’s own [[Essence]]. [[Sorcery]] is the art of shaping the [[Essence]] of the world itself, willing it into accordance with the sorcerer’s whims. To work [[sorcery]] is to command essential forces, consort with strange spirits, and call up impossible wonders.

The powers of [[sorcery]] are divided into [[#spells]] and [[Sorcerous Workings]]. A spell is a discrete power with a defined cost and effects. Sorcerous workings, on the other hand, are great feats and projects. 

[[Sorcery]] is organised into three circles: [[Charms/Solar/Occult/Terrestrial Circle Sorcery|Terrestrial]], [[Charms/Solar/Occult/Celestial Circle Sorcery|Celestial]], and [[Solar Circle Sorcery|Solar]]. The Terrestrial Circle is accessible to all Exalted, and even some Mortals. [[Celestial Circle Sorcery]] is limited to [[START HERE#Celestial Exalted|Celestial Exalted]], including Solars, Lunars, Sidereals, and some Exigents. [[Solar Circle Sorcery]] is unique to Solars.
# Motes
When a sorcerer casts a spell, the motes that power it are not drawn from her own [[Essence]] pools. Instead, she must take [[Shape Sorcery]] actions to manipulate the flow of [[Essence]] around her and channel sorcerous motes (which are themselves generated from the sorcerer's shaping rituals) into the casting of the spell.

Sorcerous motes are never committed, regardless of a spell’s duration.
# Spells
Cast using [[Shape Sorcery]], can be interfered with via [[Countermagic]].
## Control Spell
All sorcerers have at least one control spell. A control spell is a signature spell at which a sorcerer excels beyond all others, imbuing it with some special measure of her mystic will and personal prowess. Many spells enjoy special benefits when selected as a control spell, and many [[Shaping Rituals]] give special benefits to a sorcerer’s control spell.
