Such is the Lunar’s enthralling allure that fools will follow her through fire or march into the sea after her. When she uses Captivating Siren Voice, she may pay an eight-mote, two-anima surcharge to raise the cost to resist to three Willpower. Additionally, affected characters pursue her regardless of any perils faced in doing so — while they’re aware of the danger, the Lunar is so compelling they pay it little heed. They suffer a −3 penalty on rolls against environmental hazards or traps encountered while pursuing the Lunar and on Join Battle rolls. If a character other than the Lunar attacks a victim of this effect, it counts as a surprise attack 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a prey animal with Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size may learn this as an Appearance Charm.
