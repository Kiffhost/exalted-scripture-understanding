The Solar sees all things truly. When she is at the iconic anima level, she automatically gains the effects of All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight for free. Furthermore, using Spirit-Detecting Glance in combination with All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight allows the Exalt to discern the nature and Essence rating of a spirit if she succeeds at an Occult roll with a difficulty of the spirit’s Essence.
