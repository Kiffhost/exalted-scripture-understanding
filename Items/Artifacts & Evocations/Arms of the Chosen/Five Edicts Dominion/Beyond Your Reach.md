The futile efforts of Five Edict Dominion’s enemies crumble into failure like dust on the wind, proving their inferiority. The wearer gains +1 Defense against an attack made by an enemy that she has a Tie of contempt for or who is prone. If both are true, she gains +2 Defense. Even if the attack hits, withering damage is halved (round down) while decisive damage subtracts (the wearer’s Intimacy).
