*Death at the Root rends miracles in twain, ushering an end to the relict wonders of a lost age.*
The wielder can use Sunder the Flow against sorcerous workings for a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge, rolling against difficulty (Circle x 3). Terrestrial Circle workings are negated entirely; Celestial and Solar workings have their effects suppressed for ([[Essence]] + [[Strength]]) days. This Evocation is especially effective against workings that incorporated a demesne or manse as one of their Means (Exalted, p. 487). Such a Celestial Circle working can be permanently undone, while such a Solar working can be suppressed for ([[Essence]]) months.

## Resonant

Only characters resonant with [[Death at the Root]] can awaken this Evocation.
