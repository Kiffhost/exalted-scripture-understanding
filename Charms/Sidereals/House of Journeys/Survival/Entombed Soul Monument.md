*The Sidereal has become one with the world’s heart, and the world with her own.*
After an hour spent interacting with a natural landscape, the Sidereal buries one of her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] within it, giving it form as a small natural feature. Her duty to Heaven might become a natural pillar of stone; compassion might become a fruit-bearing plant or freshwater spring; her love for another might become a tree that faintly resembles them. The buried [[Intimacy]] can’t modify the Sidereal’s [[Resolve]], justify persuade actions against her, or be cited in [[Decision Points]], and it can’t be detected unless her behavior reveals it. (It can still be used for other purposes, like certain [[Charms]]). She loses these benefits while within long range of the natural feature. She can bury multiple [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. The Sidereal can’t voluntarily end this Charm unless she’s within medium range of the feature. This Charm ends if it’s destroyed.
