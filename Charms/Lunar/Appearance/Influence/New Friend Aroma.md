*Awash in enticing pheromones, the Lunar draws potential companions into her orbit.*
When she uses [[Alluring Scent Technique]] (p. XX), she may commit an additional mote to alter its effect against all characters that don’t know her and don’t have a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her. The [[Intimacy|Tie]] they’re treated as having toward her is one of friendship instead of curiosity. They’ll attempt to initiate friendly interactions with her, in a manner consistent with both their own [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] and the Lunar’s presentation. If she walks through a harbor dock, a brash seafarer might attempt to strike up a conversation, while a shy fishmonger might slip her a note with her cod. In a wild animal’s shape, observers might attempt to tame her, though they’ll employ appropriate caution. A character can pay one [[Willpower]] to resist this effect for the scene (but not the [[Intimacy|Tie]] imposed by [[Alluring Scent Technique]]).
