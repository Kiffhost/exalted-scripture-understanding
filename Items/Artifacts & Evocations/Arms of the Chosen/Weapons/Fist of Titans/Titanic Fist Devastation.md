*Crater-Gouging Blow The [[Fist of Titans]] radiates the immense gravity of the Omphalos itself, descending in an incontestable strike.*
The Exalt makes an unblockable decisive smash attack, waiving the usual [[Initiative]] cost. This attack cannot be clashed — even if an enemy uses magic such as [[Fervent Blow]], his attack is delayed until after the wielder is finished rolling hers, targeting her [[Defense]] instead of clashing normally. The Exalt doubles 10s on the damage roll. As long as the attack deals 3+ levels of damage, she may reflexively use [[Mammoth Slam Quake]], waiving its [[Willpower]] cost. Each charge spent on [[Titanic Fist Devastation]] also counts towards Mammoth Slam Quake’s cost. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 15+ [[Initiative]] from a single withering attack.
