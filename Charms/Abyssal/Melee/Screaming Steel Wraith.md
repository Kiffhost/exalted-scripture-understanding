*Unleashing one of the wretched souls bound within her blade, the Abyssal strikes with the strength of her victim’s ceaseless suffering.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after dealing at least one level of withering or decisive damage, unleashing a soul bound with [[Soul-Drinking Blade]] to roll ([[Essence]]) dice of decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. The howling shade flees, but rarely finds peace in this freedom, often succumbing to specterhood.
On decisive attacks, this Charm’s cost is paid after the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]] resets to base.
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by using [[Soul-Drinking Blade]] to capture a nontrivial enemy’s soul.
