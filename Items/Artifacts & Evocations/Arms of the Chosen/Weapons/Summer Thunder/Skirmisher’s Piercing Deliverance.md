*As the Exalt wheels her horse to withdraw, arrows whistle from [[Summer Thunder]] of their own accord to discourage pursuit.*
The wielder makes a withering attack against an opponent within close range. She then takes a reflexive disengage action. If her attack hit, the target takes a penalty equal to the Initiative lost on the roll opposing her disengage action. If the target fails the opposed roll, he doesn’t count against [[Untouchable Horseman’s Attitude]]’s one-opponent limit (Exalted, p. 382).
