The Solar occultist’s burning anima is alive with the Essence of the strange. When the Lawgiver’s anima is visible, it brings her spirit familiar into sharper relief, amplifying their power. The Solar may temporarily impart spirit Charms to her familiar that belong to spirits whose Essence patterns she has captured with Burning Exorcism Technique. 
-  At the dim level, the spirit gains no benefit. 
-  At the glowing level, she can impart (Essence / 2, rounded up) minor Charms. 
-  At the burning level, she can impart an additional major Charm. 
-  At the iconic level, she can add yet another minor and major Charm. 
As long as the Solar’s anima is visible, the familiar gains the imparted Charms automatically. If it drops a level the Charms it can use are likewise reduced. If the Solar has learned any spirit Charms through the use of Carnal Spirit Rending, Gloaming Eye Understanding, or Divine Mantle, she may choose to impart such Charms to her familiar as well. On What Light Reveals (Living Specter’s Flame) The backer wanted a Charm that would power up their spirit familiar based on the intensity of their anima. I decided it would be an Occult Charm, because the uncanny nature of Occult Charms allows for strangeness in the method. This Charm demonstrates the nature of Essence to be the whole or sum of the being. Therefore, if a Solar is absorbing the Essence of spirits, her own Essence is affected. For more on conceptualizing spirit Charms, read Divine Mantle on page 310 of Exalted. Backer: M.C.G.
