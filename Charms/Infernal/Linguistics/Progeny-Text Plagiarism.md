*Language has a life of its own, a parasite that spreads through semiotics — and like all life, it seeks to reproduce.*

The Infernal causes a written text to “bud off” a copy of itself, pouring rivulets of ink onto blank pages or a similar writing surface prepared by the Infernal. This reproductive process takes only seconds for a single page. Replicating a few pages takes minutes, while a lengthy tome may take a day. This doesn’t duplicate any magic used to enhance the original text. The Infernal must be present the entire time to oversee the process.

The contents of the progeny-text are nigh-identical to their parent’s but subtle variations may exist: a quirk of handwriting, altered punctuation, self-aware marginalia, etc. These allow a canny reader to distinguish it from the original with a (Perception + {Awareness, Investigation, or Linguistics}) roll at difficulty 3, though only if he has some reason to suspect the text’s authenticity. This Charm won’t reproduce wax seals, ornately embellished book covers, or the like — only the contents of the text.

The Infernal can bring forth greater fecundity by taking one level of lethal damage, shedding ink-black blood onto the parent text. Rather than a single copy, it births a litter of (Linguistics) progeny-texts, or (Essence + Linguistics) for very short texts.
## [[Keys]]
#### Exact Words Heredity (Linguistics 4, Essence 2)
Characters can’t distinguish a prodigy-text from its parent unless they use magic, and the difficulty to do so increases to (Essence + Linguistics). The Infernal can duplicate physical aspects of the original text, like wax seals. The dripping ink transmutes whatever pages it falls on into a physical copy of the original, as long as its Resources value doesn’t exceed (higher of Essence or 3).
#### Gravid Grimoire Mitosis (Linguistics 5, Essence 3, [[#Exact Words Heredity (Linguistics 4, Essence 2)|Exact Words Heredity]]) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she uses this Charm on a text she wrote, letting her copy any magic she used. If she takes damage to create multiple copies, she must pay this surcharge separately for each. With Essence 5, this applies to any text she copies, even if she isn’t capable of learning the effect in question, as long as she meets its Essence minimum.
