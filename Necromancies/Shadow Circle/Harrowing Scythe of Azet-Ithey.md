*With a sharp, keening paean to the obsidian-eyed prophet Azet-Ithey, the necromancer conjures a shadow of his wretched scythe, cutting down hope and joy like dry grass.*
The necromancer rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) against the [[Resolve]] of all enemies within close range as she swings the spectral scythe. Victims find their mind torn to gore and ribbons; each loses (necromancer’s [[Essence]]) positive Intimacies of their player’s choice, which they cannot regain for the rest of the story.
They also suffer a deep depression, inflicting a –(necromancer’s [[Essence]]) penalty on all attempts to instill them with positive Intimacies or inspire positive feelings. Treating this affliction requires powerful magical intervention such as [[Soul Projection Method]] (Exalted, p. 358).
The necromancer may choose to crystallize the scythe after her swing, reflexively readying it as a grimscythe (Exalted, p. 597) for the rest of the scene. Against foes affected by the spell’s curse, she adds ([[Essence]]) dice to withering damage rolls. When making instill rolls to degrade Intimacies or inspire rolls to spur feelings of futility and despair against targets within close range, she may roll [[Initiative]] instead of her normal pool, momentarily transforming her scythe into a reaping shadow that cuts the heart instead of the body.
## Control
The sorcerer may retain the scythe indefinitely, but while she sleeps, she doesn’t regain [[Willpower]] — her dreams are torn to ribbons by its cruel edge. She may awaken [[Evocations]] for the scythe, drawing on its power to cleave hopes, its partially immaterial nature, and the mythos of itinerant AzetIthey, who wanders the Underworld enforcing his edict against the blasphemy of joy.
## Distortion (15)
The victim reduces the penalty imposed by this spell by two, and can regain lost Intimacies, though never beyond Minor intensity. If directed against a necromancer wielding the grimscythe itself, distortion instead reduces its attributes to a mundane scythe (Exalted, p. 584) until dismissed.
