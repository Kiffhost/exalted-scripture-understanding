*Stone Cannot Endure Sekhem’s fire is stronger than jade, but the Exalt’s will is stronger than fire.*
As [[Sekhem]] begins to crack, its wielder lays her will upon the weapon, holding its furiously fracturing shape together with her anima. For the rest of the scene, the Exalt ignores all penalties for a cracked barrel, and gains 2 [[Initiative]] at the beginning of each of her turns. When the scene ends, [[Sekhem]] becomes wholly nonfunctional, and must be repaired as per the normal artifact repair rules (Exalted, pp. 242-243). 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the Exalt is crashed by a powerful foe while acting in service to a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]].
