*Presenting a warrant of Heaven’s reproval, the Sidereal demands that a possessing spirit take up refuge elsewhere.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Occult]]) against a possessing spirit’s [[Resolve]] to exorcise it. If successful, the spirit is expelled and can’t possess that character again until the next new moon. Enemies of fate lose one [[Willpower]]. If the Sidereal knows [[Terminal Sanction]] (p. XX), she can inflict any of its effects on an exorcised spirit. With an [[Occult]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a five-mote to banish spirits that aren’t possessing hosts. If successful, the spirit immediately dematerializes and must flee the Sidereal’s presence. This costs two [[Willpower]] to resist, and the spirit can’t do so until the scene ends. Enemies of fate native to other worlds are also driven to return to their realms; they can’t resist until they’ve spent a day traveling to their native realm or reach it. This effect also applies to exorcised spirits.
