The Dragon-Blood spins air into an enfolding shroud against all senses. Her form is blurred and indistinct, her noises muffled, and every other trace of her presence masked from detection â€” scent, body heat, and more. All rolls to oppose her Stealth take a penalty of (her Essence/2, rounded up), and she waives the cost of muting Air Charms with Whispering Dragon Soul. The Charm ends if the Dragon-Blood attacks.
