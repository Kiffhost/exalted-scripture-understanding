*The Sidereal performs a funereal ritual for herself, formally registering her death with the Division of Endings and joining the rolls of the dead.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits
- She’s considered undead by magical effects if this would be beneficial for her. This doesn’t render her an enemy of fate or a creature of darkness.
- She doesn’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on rolls against disease, poison, or necromancy.
- The undead recognize her as one of their own and count as having a Minor Tie of familiarity to her. Trivial undead can’t attack her.
With an Endings Ability 5, Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can perform a funeral for another character to confer this Charm’s benefits on him. She can grant this benefit to multiple characters; the cost of uses past the first is reduced to one mote.
