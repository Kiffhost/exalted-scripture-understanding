The Solar taps a replenishing well of inner rage, infusing her anger with primal magic, making her capable of superhuman feats. For the duration of the scene, the Exalt has +1 die to all pools related to combat and subtracts -1 from all wound penalties. However, the Exalt must be engaged in combat, or attempting to engage in combat, to become so enraged, and is compelled in all her desires toward battle. [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that compel her to fight, including negative [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that drive her to attack and positive [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that reflect her love for combat, are more powerful, increased by one in their intensities, with Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] representing a +5 or -4 rating instead of the usual +4 or -3. However, the Solar is unable to use social influence for commands unrelated to combat or persuasion more complicated than “Give up or die.” [[Battle Fury Focus]] does not make the Solar inelegant or stupid. The Exalt can make tactical disengage actions in order to kill someone or change targets, even gaining the +1 bonus to do so, but she must end the Charm in order to take a withdraw action.
