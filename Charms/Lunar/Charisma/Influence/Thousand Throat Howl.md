The Lunar’s anima erupts from her throat as all of the beasts dwelling in her [[Essence]] cry out as one. She makes a ([[Charisma]] + [Performance or Presence]) threaten roll, compelling targets to put as much distance as possible between themselves and her or find a safe place to hide from her. She ignores multiple target penalties and the [[Resolve]] bonus for lacking a common language. This affects all characters who can hear the Lunar and don’t consider her an ally, without exception. A target whose current temporary [[Willpower]] is lower than the Lunar’s suffers a [[Resolve]] penalty equal to the difference. This stacks with penalties from [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], but the combined penalty can’t exceed −4. Affected characters suffer a −3 penalty on rolls to do anything but flee or hide from the Lunar, but add one die on rolls to achieve those ends. Trivial opponents and animals (except familiars and magically enhanced animals) can’t assert [[Resolve]] against this or resist with [[Willpower]].
