*The Abyssal laughs at the failing efforts and faltering words of the so-called heroes who stand against her.*
When a character makes an influence roll against the Abyssal, she gains motes equal to his 1s and 2s. She also gains this benefit against rolls to inflict Shaping effects or sorcerous curses on her. She can only spend these motes on influence rolls, read intentions actions, [[Resolve]], and [[Guile]]. Any unspent motes are lost at the end of the scene.
