*The deathknight shifts gracefully between murder and light conversation.*
The Abyssal passes off violence or combat as a prank, tryst, or harmless mishap. For instance, after slitting her target’s throat at a party, she might make him look as if he simply spilled his wine, or explain away his listlessness as mere intoxication. She reflexively makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [Larceny, [[Presence]], or Socialize]) instill roll against all bystanders not directly involved in it, adding ([[Essence]]) nonCharm successes. Targets who are participating in a social event, recreation, or sensual pleasure count as having a Minor [[Intimacy]] that supports this influence.
A character can spend one [[Willpower]] to resist this if circumstances change dramatically in a way that undermines the Abyssal’s lie or if his ignorance poses a threat to a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]].
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses this Charm immediately after an attack enhanced with [[Stifled Cry Pantomime]], she reduces this Charm’s cost by one mote for each round of silence inflicted.
