# [[White Reaper Style]]
White Reaper style uses the long reach of a spear or scythe to take on great numbers of enemies at once. Students of the style are not only capable of fighting when hopelessly outnumbered, but thrill in doing so, fighting their best when surrounded on all sides or single-handedly holding off an army. While it is still formidable to face one on one, the style is strongest when used against battle groups, cutting them down like a reaper harvesting wheat. The distinctive visual signature of this style is the white halo that engulfs its masters as they slay their foes, a corona of [[Essence]] that waxes as the martial artist slaughters her enemies and wanes as she uses powerful [[Charms]] that discharge it.
## Weapons
White Reaper is used with scythes and spears. It can also be used with the staff or with unarmed strikes that emulate the wide reach of polearms in whirling strikes, for Reapers who prefer to show mercy to their enemies. Any unarmed attack enhanced by a White Reaper Charm can always be stunted to deal lethal damage. 
## Armour
White Reaper style is compatible with all armor.
