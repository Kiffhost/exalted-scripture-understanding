Consumed by overwhelming compassion, the Solar cannot see the suffering of others without intervening. Whenever heseesasufferinginnocent,hemustintervenetohelpthem in the most dramatic way possible. If she is being harmed, the Solar must either intercede to take the blows meant for her, or else kill her aggressor. If her suffering is caused by poverty, sickness, or other prevailing conditions of her life, the Solar must find some similarly dramatic method in which to help her, working without cease to do so.
Compassionate Martyrdom can be ended prematurely if the Solar sees that the actions he has taken have caused the people she is trying to protect to fear or reject her, or if she loses a combat that she started because of the Limit Break.
