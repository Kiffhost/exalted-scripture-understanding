The Sidereal recites a formal blessing over a pair of creatures, tying their fates together under the Pillar’s auspices. The Sidereal performs a minute-long ceremony, requiring that both characters be present to witness it, even if they don’t understand it. Those beings become capable of understanding each other without a shared language. The Sidereal can include herself in such a pairing, and can affect animals, constructs, or stranger things. This can make it possible to communicate with animals but doesn’t make those animals any more intelligent. With a Linguistics 5, Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can use this Charm instantly, committing its mote cost, to grant herself the ability to communicate with all characters for one scene. At the end of the scene, she gains a Minor Tie with a positive context of her choice to one of the characters she communicated with, chosen by the Storyteller. She can’t weaken it until the story ends. Reset: Characters other than the Sidereal can’t benefit from more than one use of this Charm per story.
