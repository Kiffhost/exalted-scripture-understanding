It is possible to crash someone with the Brawl 5, Essence 3+ upgrade without making an attack. This counts as crashing him with an attack. The Solar is awarded the crash bonus, and any Charms which would trigger by crashing someone, or by gaining a crash bonus are applicable before she makes her attack roll.
