*The Abyssal strikes with cruel precision, inflicting as much pain as possible.*
The Abyssal adds an automatic success on an attack roll. If her target suffers a −1 or higher wound penalty, the success is non-Charm. If she deals 5+ withering damage or any decisive damage with an attack, her victim’s wound penalty increases by one until the end of her next turn.
