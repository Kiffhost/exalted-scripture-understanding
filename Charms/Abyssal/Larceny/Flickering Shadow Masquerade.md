*The Abyssal shrouds herself in falsehoods with but a gesture, changing faces between blinks of an eye.*
The Abyssal completes a disguise roll in seconds.
She can ignore penalties for lacking appropriate equipment with clever stunting. In combat, she gains (Manipulation) Initiative if a successful disguise roll provides a tactical advantage.
With a Larceny 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm reflexively. In combat, she can only use it on her turn. This makes it compatible with Simple Charms like False Heart Mien. If she uses this Charm together with a non-Excellency Larceny Charm that enhances disguises, she waives this Charm’s Willpower cost.
