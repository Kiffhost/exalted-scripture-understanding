*From the breath of Essence to the will that holds the psyche together, no hope escapes the Infernal’s touch.*

The Infernal makes a decisive attack, adding (10 – target’s current temporary Willpower) bonus dice on the attack roll. If she deals 3+ levels of damage, her target loses one Willpower, plus an additional Willpower for each 10 on the damage roll, maximum (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3). The target can’t recover points of temporary Willpower from any source until he’s received a full night’s sleep.

If this leaves an enemy with (Infernal’s Essence) Willpower or less, he weakens an Intimacy of his choice based on something like hope, happiness, or belief in the goodness of people or the world by one step unless he pays one Willpower to resist. If he doesn’t have any, he forms a Minor Principle based on overwhelming despair, with the specifics chosen by his player. He can’t voluntarily strengthen a weakened Intimacy or weaken an imposed Principle until he reaches full Willpower.
## [[Keys]]
#### Death of All Happiness
The victim must also weaken an Intimacy by one step for each point of Willpower he loses, as above. The Infernal can now choose to target specific Intimacies she’s aware of, though not Defining Intimacies. If an enemy is incapacitated or reduced to zero, all such Intimacies are fully erased except for Defining Intimacies, which are reduced to Minor.
