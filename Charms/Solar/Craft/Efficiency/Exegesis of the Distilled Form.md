After completing five legendary projects, the Exalt may expend a tremendous amount of creative energy to renew the power of her Essence. After spending the cost of the Charm, roll a number of dice equal to the Solar’s remaining white points. Successes are converted to experience points and added to the Solar’s total experience (though they don’t count toward raising Essence). This roll counts as an expenditure of white points; all of the Solar’s white points are cleared by using this Charm. The Exalt may not accrue more than twenty experience points through a single use of this Charm, and this Charm may not be used more than once per story.
