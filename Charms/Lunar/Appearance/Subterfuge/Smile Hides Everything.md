The Lunar controls her facial expression and body language as only a shapeshifter can, conveying only what she wishes her audience to see.
The Lunar can calculate [[Guile]] with [[Appearance]] instead of [[Manipulation]]. If someone whose base [[Resolve]] is lower than her [[Appearance]] rolls opposing her [[Guile]], she may pay one mote to have up to (her [[Essence]]) of his 1s subtract successes.
