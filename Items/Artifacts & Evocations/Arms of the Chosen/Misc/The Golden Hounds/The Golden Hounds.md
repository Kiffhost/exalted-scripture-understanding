In Joyous Lance’s youth, mounted raiders attacked her village. Unable to fight, her parents and neighbors dead or dying, she seized her infant brother Sand and ran with him for safety. Heart hammering and racing, she was pressed beyond endurance as she fled and dodged — until she Exalted, and left her galloping pursuers far behind. Years later, upon learning that Sand’s caravan was raided by the Fair Folk, Joyous [[Lance]] raced a thousand miles to his rescue, but lost his trail when his captors outpaced her into the Wyld. Ever after, she could not stand still. She cozened from Ruvia, god of roads, his ever-swift sandals, and had them forged into the soles of orichalcum boots that could outrace any quarry and trace any spoor. Thus shod, she vanished into the Wyld to rescue her brother. Sleek and aerodynamic, these orichalcum and simhataleather boots gleam brighter when in motion, eventually flashing and throwing sparks when their wearer moves with preternatural haste. They cost three motes to attune. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the Golden Hounds

The Golden Hounds’ strength resides in speed. Each time the Exalt moves a range band, she gains +1 Celerity, up to a maximum of ([[Athletics]]). Her Celerity is added as non-Charm bonus dice on all combat movement rolls. At the start of her turn, her Celerity resets to zero if she hasn’t moved any range bands since the start of her last turn. Making a non-gambit attack resets Celerity to zero after the attack. [[The Golden Hounds]] still remember Joyous Lance’s hunt through the Wyld. If the wearer knows IntegrityProtecting Prana (Exalted, p. 303), she gains the Charm’s benefits at no cost as long as she is running and takes no other actions, except [[Perception]]- or [[Wits]]-based actions.
