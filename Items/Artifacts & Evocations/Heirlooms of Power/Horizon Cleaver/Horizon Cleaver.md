When the Dragon-Blooded and Sidereal Exalted threw down their Solar masters in the Usurpation, the fury of Creation’s Chosen stirred the heavens into world-spanning storms, a thunderous reflection of the struggle below. Inspired by strife and storm, the Sidereal mastermind Echo Gyre forged Horizon Cleaver, a titanic battle axe that honors the resplendence of those storms, for Ashen Tiger, her most trusted lieutenant. A six-foot rod of blue jade forms the grimcleaver’s haft, wrapped in braided steel and black rubber. Twin blades resemble reflections of a jagged moon, with inlays of red jade extolling the Usurpation in lyric poetry. Horizon Cleaver hums while resting, and in battle wreathes itself with blue, rapacious lightning. A wielder with sufficient discipline can direct the axe’s fury, but one who falters spills the storm and decimates without aim. Ashen Tiger carried Horizon Cleaver as she led legions against surviving Lunar mates of dead Solars. Her daughter, Song of Ivory, used it to raze an insubordinate city, beginning its long ancestral lineage. It was wielded by one of Tepet’s sisters in their ill-fated siege of the Imperial City, and she and the grimcleaver joined House Tepet. Its most recent wielder, the dragonlord Tepet Yasenar, fell during the house’s ruinous campaign in the North. Accounts conflict as to the grimcleaver’s fate. Some say it sank into the White Sea; others that it answers now to the Bull of the North; and others still that Yasenar’s daughter, Tepet Mareja, recovered the axe and gathers strength to reclaim her house’s glory. 

## Evocations of Horizon Cleaver

Horizon Cleaver crackles with lightning, adding one die of withering or decisive damage on chopping attacks. Unattuned characters who draw it from its ebony case become thunderstruck for the remainder of the scene, as per Brilliant Reproach.
