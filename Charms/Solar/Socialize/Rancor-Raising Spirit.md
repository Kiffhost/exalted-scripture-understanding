Sometimes the Lawgiver must tear down in order to build up. This Charm supplements an instill action to erode an [[Intimacy]]. If successful, the target also gains a new negative Minor [[Intimacy]] that reflects the one that has been eroded. Thus a Solar’s arguments could work to sow disfavor for the [[Guild]], while also instilling a negative view of slavery. This Charm fails if the target has Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that directly contradict the proposed Minor [[Intimacy]]. 

## Special activation rules

The player must declare what Minor [[Intimacy]] they plan to tack on before using this Charm. During the instill action, the declared [[Intimacy]] must be a part of the Solar’s pitch.

### On [[Rancor-Raising Spirit]]

I wrote this Charm to demonstrate a more powerful converse of the prerequisite. The Solar can use this to defeat the iniquities that plague her lands, by coupling negative viewpoints onto vehement or convincing obloquy. Some of you might think this Charm doesn’t work by its example, because someone with a positive view of the [[Guild]] would have to have a positive view of slavery. But that’s not actually true — the [[Guild]] deals in a number of vast enterprises, and this can work to conceal the effects of slave labor. Moreover, it is human nature to overlook or to refuse to see the moral or ethical contradictions in every day life. Evil flourishes thusly. Indeed, there is no other way that it flourishes.
