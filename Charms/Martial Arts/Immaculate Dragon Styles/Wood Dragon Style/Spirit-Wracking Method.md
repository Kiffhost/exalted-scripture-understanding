*The Immaculate chastises unruly spirits with strikes that carry the seeds of her vital [[Essence]], to blossom within the spirit’s anima.*
Her withering attack against a spirit doubles 8s on the damage roll, but doesn’t grant her any [[Initiative]]. She rolls a die of lethal decisive damage for every 10 on the withering damage roll, ignoring [[Hardness]]. A spirit crashed by her attack suffers agonizing pain, doubling its wound penalties and the crippling penalty from [[Soul-Marking Style]] until it recovers from crash.
