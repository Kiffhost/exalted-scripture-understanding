*In a breath of silver sand and delicate azure petals, the Infernal grants someone’s greatest desire — and few are careful what they wish for.*

When the Infernal hears someone express dissatisfaction or dislike for their current state, she temporarily grants him up to (Infernal’s Essence/2, rounded up) dots in an Attribute, (Essence) dots in an Ability, or (Essence) specialties. She must be there in person to hear him. If the target’s player is unwilling, she must make a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Presence) bargain roll against him. He can pay one Willpower to resist. Granted traits don’t count as bonuses from Charms. The target can gain them permanently by spending experience or incurring experience debt (p. XX), with no training time needed.

If the Infernal maintains this Charm for at least a full story, her target falls into her debt. The same is true if he purchases the granted trait permanently. She may demand that he perform a single inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216). He is not compelled to obey, but if he refuses, his wish curdles into a curse, causing him to suffer (Infernal’s Essence) botches at a dramatically appropriate moment. The consequences reflect the nature of his wish: if a merchant prince wished for great beauty, a botched influence roll might cause a potential business partner to become hopelessly enamoured with him, getting in the way of business.

If the Infernal ends this Charm, her target immediately loses the granted trait unless he’s purchased it with experience. She has until the end of the story to call in any favours owed by him.

The Infernal may use this Charm multiple times simultaneously in response to a single expression of discontent, waiving the Willpower cost of uses past the first. She can bless multiple characters, but can’t stack more than (Essence) uses per character. Multiple uses potentially allow her to accrue multiple debts.
## Reset
The Infernal can only use this on a given character once per story. This is reset if he learns the granted trait permanently with experience.
## [[Keys]]
#### Bestowal of Accursed Fortune (Essence 2)
The Infernal can grant a character a total of up to five dots of the Backing, Contacts, Followers, Mentor, Retainers, or Resources Merits, which are drawn into his life by the end of the current session or the next one. She can’t grant more than (higher of her Essence or 3) dots in the same Merit. Her target can lose these Merits based in story events even if he incurs experience debt, but this refunds any experience spent.
#### Scoured Perfection of Form (Essence 2)
The Infernal can grant a character up to five dots of mutations as a body-altering Shaping effect. These mutations are often monstrous or demonic, though sometimes they’re possessed of an alien beauty.
#### As You Wish (Essence 3) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge grant wishes even if she isn’t personally present, like when she hears a prayer with [[Penitents Like Scattered Grains]].
#### Miracle Gift Mastery (Essence 3, [[#Bestowal of Accursed Fortune (Essence 2)|Bestowal of Accursed Fortune]], [[#Scoured Perfection of Form (Essence 2)|Scoured Perfection of Form]]) (+5m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to instantly grant a character a Charm, spell, thaumaturgical ritual, or similar magical power whose prerequisites he meets. This applies even for magic the Infernal can’t learn, like Solar Charms, though it can’t teach Sidereal Martial Arts. The target must incur experience debt to gain it — the Infernal can’t sustain this Charm with a mote commitment.
