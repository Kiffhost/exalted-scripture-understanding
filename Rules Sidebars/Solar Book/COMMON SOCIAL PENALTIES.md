As mentioned near the beginning of this chapter (p. 188), penalties can and should frequently be used to reflect difficult or awkward social situations. While this list is by no means complete, here are some of the most common social penalties:
A -1 penalty might represent: Showing up at a formal affair in improper attire, addressing a character with improper honorifics or titles, committing a minor cultural faux pas.
A -3 penalty might represent: Showing up at a formal affair in offensive attire, addressing character with open rudeness, giving sketchy or shifting justifications for requests, committing a major cultural faux pas, giving a performance with a musical instrument you’re unfamiliar with, trying to convince someone to do something he doesn’t know how to do, trying to convince someone to believe something despite significant evidence it’s false.
A -5 penalty might represent: Showing up at a formal affair naked and covered in blood, trying to get favors from a character you are openly antagonizing, trying to convince someone to do something when he knows you’re lying, breaking a major law or cultural taboo through your social behavior, trying to convince someone to do something dangerous that he doesn’t know how to do, trying to convince someone to believe something blatantly and obviously false.
