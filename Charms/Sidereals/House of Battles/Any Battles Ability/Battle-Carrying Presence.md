So long as the Sidereal has the courage and strength to fight on, so too do her comrades in arms. [[Allies]] who can perceive the Sidereal gain +2 [[Resolve]] against fear-based influence, up to a maximum of the Sidereal’s total [[Resolve]] against the effect. Any wound penalties such allies suffer are reduced to the Sidereal’s own if it’s lower.
