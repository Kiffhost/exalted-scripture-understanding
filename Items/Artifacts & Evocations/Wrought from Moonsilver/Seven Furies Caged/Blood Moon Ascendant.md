Howling her pain to the sky, the Lunar taps the illimitable rage of every warrior to have ever borne Seven Furies Caged into battle. To use this Evocation, Relentless Lunar Fury must be active. She rolls (Stamina + Strength), ignoring her wound penalty and converting it into bonus dice, gaining Initiative equal to the successes. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with an attack that dealt 5+ levels of damage more than necessary to do so. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation can be flurried with a feat of strength, rush, or threaten roll. 

## Resonant

If the Lunar gains 10+ Initiative, her attack is reset (Exalted, p. 255).
