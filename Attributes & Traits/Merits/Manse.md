This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
The character owns a manse—a magnificent magical tower, fortress, palace, or estate raised atop a demesne and designed to capture and channel its power. Many manses are designed to express minor magical powers to enhance the beauty or comfort of the building, such as columns of free-standing water filled with colorful fish, or floors which stay warmed with channeled fire Essence even in the depths of winter.
In addition to ownership of the manse itself, possessing this Merit at three dots provides the benefits of both the [[Demesne]] Merit (p. 160) and the [[Hearthstone]] Merit (p.161), at two dots each, for no additional cost. With five dots, the character is the owner of a manse raised atop an exceptionally powerful demesne, with a concomitantly powerful hearthstone (replicating the benefits of the four-dot Demesne and Hearthstone Merits).

#### Sidereal
Many Sidereals have manses in Heaven. They’re typically Lunar, Sidereal, or Solar manses, though others exist in Yu-Shan.
