*The Dragon-Blood swears vengeance on a character that has harmed the subject of one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], instantly forming a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of hatred towards him, or strengthening such an existing [[Intimacy|Tie]] by one step.*
She gains +2 [[Resolve]] against any influence that would weaken this [[Intimacy|Tie]], or that would deter her from her chosen course of revenge. For the duration of her vendetta, she waives the cost of [[Uneating Earth Meditation]], [[Unsleeping Earth Meditation]], and [[Untiring Earth Meditation]] (pp. 247-248). In battle against the object of her vendetta or his allies or minions, she adds +([[Intimacy]]) natural soak and gains ([[Intimacy]]) [[Hardness]]. If the Dragon-Blood goes a day without pursuing her vendetta, she loses two [[Willpower]]. If she has no [[Willpower]] remaining, she suffers a level of unpreventable aggravated damage. Upon successfully concluding her vendetta to her satisfaction, she sheds the [[Intimacy]] formed by this Charm and gains two points of [[Willpower]]. This may bring her above her permanent [[Willpower]] rating. This Charm can only be used once per story. If the Dragon-Blood maintains it through multiple stories, she cannot use it again until sheâ€™s ended it and a new story begins.
