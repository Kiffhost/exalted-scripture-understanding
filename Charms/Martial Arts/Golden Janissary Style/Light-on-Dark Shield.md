*No shadow intrudes upon the light.*
Spinning her weapon to build momentum, the stylist clashes an attack with her own withering attack. Her attack cannot deal more damage than (her Overwhelming), which she doesn’t gain. 
Against creatures of darkness, a successful clash also rolls one die of aggravated damage, ignoring Hardness.
## Terrestrial
This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round, and can’t be used if she’s already attacked this round.
