The Distaff’s threads are quick to catch at enemy limbs and blades. This Evocation allows the wielder to make a disarm or grapple gambit as a counterattack, after the attack is rolled but before damage is rolled. This doesn’t count as her combat action for the round. 

## Dissonant

The wielder may only counterattack if she successfully parries. 

## Resonant

Every threshold success on the attack roll adds one bonus die on the Initiative roll for the gambit.
