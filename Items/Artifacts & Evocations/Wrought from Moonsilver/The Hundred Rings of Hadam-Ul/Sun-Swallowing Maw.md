The Hundred Rings twist, multiply, and expand until they can capture even the sun in the heavens. The wielder adds a free full Excellency on a grapple attack roll, and can grapple Legendary Size foes. Every 10 on the attack and Initiative rolls rerolls a failed die on the control roll. On a successful clinch, the wielder may expend three rounds of control to knock her foe prone beneath the chainsâ€™ weight.
## Resonant

Only wielders resonant with the Hundred Rings can awaken this Evocation.
