Sensingthepathofanenemyprojectile,theDragon-Blood strikes it aside with an arrow of her own. She may reflexively clash any ranged attack against her with a withering attack, without needing to aim. Winning the clash knocks the enemy’s attack away harmlessly, but doesn’t roll damage. She still gains Initiative from a successful attack, and her attacker suffers both an onslaught penalty and the −2 Defense penalty for losing a clash.
