*A master of artifice and a forger of souls, Death’s Lawgiver unveils dread wonders of her design.*
The Abyssal can use Barrow-Mound Stockpile to create a two-dot artifact without needing to roll. She receives five gold points as long as this satisfies a basic objective (Exalted, p. 240).
With Essence 5, the Abyssal can create three-dot artifacts with this Charm.
