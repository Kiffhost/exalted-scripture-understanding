As the Exalt kills an enemy, she cuts away all memory of him from the world. His body is unrecognizable even to those closest to him; he fades from the thoughts and memories of everyone who has ever encountered him, leaving onlyanameless,shadowygapintheirmutualhistory.Only the wielder herself is immune to this effect. A character who encounters the victim’s body or who seeks to remember his involvement in a past event fails outright unless he has an Intimacy connected to the deceased, or his Resolve exceeds the wielder’s Manipulation. Even then, he must spend one Willpower to ignore this effect for one scene. He may ignore it indefinitely if he’s spent more Willpower this way than the wielder’s Manipulation. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder slays an enemy that she has a negative Defining Tie towards, and waives the Willpower cost of using it to erase that foe from memory.
