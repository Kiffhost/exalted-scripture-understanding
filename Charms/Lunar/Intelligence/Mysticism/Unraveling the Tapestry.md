*The Lunar finds the thread of doubt in a perfect tapestry.*
When she learns of a prophecy or similar magic ensuring an event will come to pass, such as [[God-King’s Shrike (Dogstar Ruminations)|God-King's Shrike]] (Exalted, p. 340), she [[Introducing a Fact|introduces a fact]] with ([[Intelligence]] + {Lore or Occult}), opposing the successes rolled for that effect or (its creator’s [[Essence]] + 1) it if it was unrolled. Success reveals a loophole in the prophecy that can avert the worst of the foretold doom.
The Lunar’s player should work with the Storyteller to devise a task that’s dramatically appropriate to opposing the prophecy and sufficiently difficult to justify undermining it. If the task is achieved, the prophecy has only a partial effect. At minimum, this guarantees that the Lunar, her Solar mate, anyone she has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward, and any territories claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]] won’t be killed or destroyed as a direct result of the foretold doom. 
If a prophecy the Lunar is unaware of would harm anyone or anything this Charm could protect from certain destruction, she can use this Charm unconsciously, warned of the impinging weight of destiny by a creeping sense of dread. 
## Exampl
A Solar predicts a star will fall on [[Lunar Dominions#Thousand Fangs Total Control Zone#Mahalanka|Mahalanka]] with [[God-King’s Shrike (Dogstar Ruminations)|God-King's Shrike]]. [[Raksi]] uses this Charm, beating his successes. She declares that a spear fashioned from the bones of a certain constellation-god can turn aside the star. [[Raksi]] kills the god, creates the spear, and splits the star in half with it. Its fragments still cause destruction, but less than if the star had fallen unbroken, and they won’t kill [[Raksi]] or those she cares for.
