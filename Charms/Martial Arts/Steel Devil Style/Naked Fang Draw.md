The Exalt grasps a blade in each hand and makes a lightning speed drawâ€”a technique designed for ending a fight before it starts. This Charm supplements a Join Battle roll made with any Ability, adding (Essence or two, whichever is greater) successes to the result, and allowing the Exalt to shift successes from her Initiative pool directly into that of her Offhand Charge. In addition, if her result beats that of all of her opponents, she gains one automatic point of Charge.
