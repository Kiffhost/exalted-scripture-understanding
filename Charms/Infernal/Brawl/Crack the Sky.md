*One day, the monster will tear the sun from the sky. Until then, she flings screaming reminders of this doom into the heavens as her unwilling heralds.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must be grappling an enemy with World-Breaker Grip. She makes a decisive throw attack, which receives [[Foe-Flung Doom|Foe-Flung Doom's]] benefits for free. (This includes the [[Foe-Flung Doom#Fall to Ruin (Brawl 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)|Fall to Ruin]] key’s Willpower cost if she has it.) She can throw her enemy up to four range bands, dealing damage as a long-range fall, without needing to expend any rounds of control.

There’s no limit on how many rounds of control the Infernal can expend to increase the throw’s damage. Each round of control expended also lets her add one extra success on the attack roll as a die of decisive damage. She rerolls all dice on the damage roll that initially show failures.

If the Infernal has (5 + target’s remaining undamaged health levels) rounds of control, she can dispense with the need for an attack roll. She simply flings her victim up to (Essence x 5) miles away. When he falls into the ground — something that can take up to five minutes — he suffers uncountable damage (Exalted, p. 205). So do surrounding structures, natural features, and trivial characters, at the Storyteller’s discretion. Against Legendary Size enemies, the Infernal can do so with only 25+ rounds of control, regardless of how many undamaged levels they have remaining. This still resets the Infernal’s Initiative.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Unwitting Victim Bludgeon]] reflexively with this Charm to combine its effect with this Charm’s. If she uses [[Unwitting Victim Bludgeon#Splattered Foe Barrage (Brawl 5, Essence 3) (+4m)|Splattered Foe Barrage]], its shockwave extends out to medium range. If she deals uncountable damage to her foe, it doesn’t apply to others — she must make an attack roll against her other target and rolls damage as usual. Dealing uncountable damage increases [[Unwitting Victim Bludgeon#Splattered Foe Barrage (Brawl 5, Essence 3) (+4m)|Splattered Foe Barrage's]] range to long.
