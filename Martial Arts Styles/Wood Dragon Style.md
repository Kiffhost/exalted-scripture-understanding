# [[Wood Dragon Style]]
The most esoteric of the Immaculate Dragon styles, Wood Dragon oversees the cycles of life and death. Its students undergo grueling regimens that bring them to the edge of death, fasting to their bodies’ limits while consuming copious quantities of hallucinogenic and entheogenic drugs. When they return to the world of the living, they bring mysterious insight with them. In battle, these mystics draw on an extensive knowledge of pressure points and [[Essence]] flows to both subdue foes and heal allies. Masters of the style are rumored to possess a technique that can bring instant death, destroying the soul itself.
## Weapons
Wood Dragon unarmed attacks are precise finger jabs targeting pressure points and nerve clusters. The style also uses the staff. Wood Dragon stylists train in wielding the long bow as a close-range weapon, using the traits of a staff. Wood Dragon style can’t be used through ranged attacks made with a bow, but the Immaculate doesn’t need a ready weapon action to change between using a bow as a ranged weapon and wielding it as a staff. 
## Armour
This style is compatible with light armor.
