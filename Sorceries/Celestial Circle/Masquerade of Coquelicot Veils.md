*A crimson haze fills her surroundings as the sorcerer issues a mandatory invitation to the Court of Coquelicot Veils, a numinous presence that costumes all in its penumbra with masks and cloaks of every shade of red.*
Standing within a structure, the sorcerer shrouds it in illusion, rolling (Manipulation + Occult). This enchantment encompasses not just the structure’s interior, but also its outdoor premises and any outbuildings, which must be within a mile of the sorcerer when she casts this spell.
Anyone within the area is clothed in an illusory costume for as long as they remain there. Such guises are of random design; conceal the appearance, voice, and scent of those who wear them; and make it impossible to discern what kind of being they are. This includes distorting or altering the appearance of distinctive supernatural displays, like anima banners. This counts as a disguise, using the sorcerer’s successes. Rolls opposing the disguise automatically fail unless supplemented by magic, and even then suffer a (sorcerer’s Essence) penalty.
Characters can spend two Willpower to tear off their illusory costume, reasserting their identity.
## Control
The sorcerer can clothe herself in an illusory costume. Such guises aren’t as flawless as the true spell, but they let her complete a roll to disguise herself instantly and ignore penalties for lacking equipment. However, she still has no control over the costume’s disguise, potentially limiting its utility and making it useless for impersonation. If this significantly inconveniences her, it awards her experience as if it were a Flaw (Exalted, p. 167).
## Distortion
(15)
A sorcerer within the masquerade may warp the spell so that its disguises no longer conceal one of the following features: voice, scent, or type of being.****
