Curse-Defying Exuberance (Essence 2; Argent Revelry Festival, Herd Reinforcement Stance): Free an organization from hostile magic like Indolent Official’s Curse by leading its members in a custom, ritual, or celebration
that’s meaningful to them.
Questing Beast Mythos (Essence 2; Lightning-Calling Challenge): Mock or taunt someone into obsessing over
the Lunar as their rival or the object of a grudge or vendetta.
Captivating Devil-Saint Iconography (Essence 3; Beast-God Idolatry): Art created with Beast-God Idolatry
exerts a mesmerizing Psyche effect, drawing attention to itself and causing those affected to obsess over both
possessing the artwork and meeting the character depicted in it.
Primal Passion Intensity (Essence 3; Heart-Stirring Expression): Inspire emotions that endure beyond a
scene and are harder to resist.
Wilderness-Carved Visage (Essence 3; Beast-God Idolatry, Boundary-Marking Meditation): The Lunar can
use Beast-God Idolatry to imbue its influence in all artworks in a territory that depicts her or one of her shapes.
Wolf Unites the Flock (Essence 3; Herd Reinforcement Stance): By insulting, mocking, or deriding a particular culture or one of its customs, the Lunar rouses even outcasts and malcontents to its defense, weakening
members of that culture’s negative Ties toward it or similar [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], or persuading them to do something
that opposes such [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. With Ogre-King’s Challenge, this can be used to reinforce a leader’s standing if
he bests — or “bests” — the Lunar.
Untamed Revelry Enticement (Essence 4; Unceasing Hunger Affliction x2): Make a festivity, entertainment,
recreation, or worldly pleasure hypnotically captivating.
