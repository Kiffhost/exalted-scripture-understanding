*The martial artist understands the true nature of disease — not a malady of blood and flesh, but a disruption in the patterns and flows of [[Essence]].*
When the stylist uses Infectious [[Essence]] Discharge or other magic that transmits diseases, a victim who fails his opposed roll loses motes equal to his 1s and 2s. Characters without motes lose [[Willpower]] instead. Additionally, the stylist can infect automata, undead, and other beings who’re intrinsically immune to disease. This doesn’t overcome magic like [[Immunity to Everything Technique]] (Exalted, p. 379). 
## Enlightenment
Victims also lose [[Initiative]] for their 1s and 2s, which the stylist doesn’t gain. If this crashes an enemy, he contracts the disease at Major Intensity.
