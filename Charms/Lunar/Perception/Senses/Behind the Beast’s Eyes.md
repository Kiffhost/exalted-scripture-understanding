*Reaching into the depths of an animal’s mind, the Lunar subsumes it into her own will.*
The Lunar can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Sense-Borrowing Method]] on an animal to forge a more controlling mental bond. While sleeping or meditating, she can assume control of the animal. Use the rules for shapeshifting to determine her dice pools and static values while doing so (Lunars, p. 131). She can’t use [[Charms]] or other magic through it, but isn’t affected by any harm it suffers.
Even while the Lunar isn’t directly controlling the animal, it won’t harm her and is generally docile and compliant, unless it has strong reason not to be or would qualify as a three-dot [[Familiar]]. Even then, it won’t attack or otherwise harm her or her allies.
With Sense-Borrowing Method’s second purchase, the Lunar can use this Charm on trivial mortals. She need only pay one [[Willpower]] to use both effects. SenseBorrowing Method’s third purchase likewise lets it be used on trivial spirits or fae. (Spirits are rarely trivial, but the Wyld abounds with weak, minor fae).
This Charm is incompatible with [[Hundred-Eyed Watcher]].
