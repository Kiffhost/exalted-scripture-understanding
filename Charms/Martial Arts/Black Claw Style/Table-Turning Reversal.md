*Only a coward would use a weapon to strike down an unarmed man. All Creation rejoices to see a bully given a dose of his own medicine, and the Black Claw stylist is the one to do it.* 
[[Table-Turning Reversal]] can be used to respond to an attack with a disarm gambit, adding one automatic success to both the attack roll and [[Initiative]] roll. If the martial artist successfully disarms her enemy, she may reflexively ready his weapon instead of throwing it aside. Stealing an artifact weapon breaks its wielderâ€™s attunement and allows the martial artist to reflexively commit the motes needed to attune to it. As long as she wields it, it is considered a Black Claw style weapon. The first time she uses a stolen weapon to land a successful decisive attack against the enemy she stole it from, she also treats her attack roll as an instill roll against the [[Resolve]] of all witnesses, either creating a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards the martial artist or eroding positive Ties towards her victim (her choice).
