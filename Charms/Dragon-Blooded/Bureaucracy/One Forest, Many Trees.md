The Dragon-Blood cultivates interpersonal relationships and spreads her roots through society. This Charm depicts an Exalt whose mastery of networking ensures that she always knows just the person for a job. Once per story, she may make an (Essence + Bureaucracy) roll that cannot be enhanced by magic. She immediately gains a number of dots equal to the successes on the roll to divide among the following Merits. These Merits depict new Storyteller characters who have some past entanglement with the Dragon-Blood, perhaps impressed by her bureaucratic prowess or indebted to her for a past favor. Allies: The Dragon-Blood calls on the assistance of a noteworthy character. Contacts: The Dragon-Blood gets in touch with a character that can provide access to the intelligence gathered by a group of contacts. Followers: The Dragon-Blood recruits a large volunteer workforce. Mentor: The Dragon-Blood requests the guidance of a more experienced character. Retainers: The Dragon-Blood obtains the services of mortal experts. At the end of the story, the Merits are lost as the recruited characters return to their lives, unless the Storyteller deems that the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s treatment of them qualifies to retain them long-term as Story Merits (Exalted, p. 158).
