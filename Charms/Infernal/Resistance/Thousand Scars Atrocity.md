*How can one bear so many scars, so many old wounds, and still survive? The Infernal answers such questions with cruel laughter and smug assurance.*

The Infernal heals rapidly for one round for every two motes or two Initiative spent on this Charm. On the turn she uses this Charm, she can heal one level of bashing or lethal damage or convert a level of aggravated damage to lethal. However, she can’t heal damage to her −0 or −1 health levels. She repeats this at the start of each of her turns.

This Charm’s healing marks the Infernal with strange and sometimes grotesque signs of recovery: scars that shift and writhe like worms, wounds scabbed over with tarnished brass, or broken bones healing at disjointed angles. She may choose to have these fade away after (6 – Stamina) days.

This Charm is fuelled by the Infernal’s killing intent, and so can’t be used outside of combat.
## Special activation rules
If the Infernal has [[By Rage Recast]] (p. XX), she can manifest its mutations when she uses this Charm.
