Speaking with mesmerizing tone and cadence, the Lunar lulls her prey into a half-trance. She may use [[Manipulation]] instead of [[Appearance]] to determine the bonus dice added (Exalted, p. 218) on an instill or persuade roll. If she adds any dice this way, her victim’s trance is deep enough that his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] can’t modify his [[Resolve]], positively or negatively, against that influence. He can still invoke [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] in a Decision Point.
