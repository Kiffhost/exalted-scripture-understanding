*The Infernal in her infinitude knows many things she is not yet aware of, and acts on these instincts in service of her inevitable self.*

The Infernal makes a retroactive case scene roll to examine an area she could have plausibly been at this story, or a retroactive profile character roll against someone she’s interacted with this story. Whatever information this reveals, the Infernal has retroactively known all along — for instance, she might be aware she’s having a conversation with a killer if she retroactively turns up a murder weapon in his lodgings.

Success also lets the Infernal reveal preparations she’s made based on the information revealed. As she meets with a murderer, she might reach for a daiklave hidden in advance or stall for time until the allies she’s tipped off can surround the teahouse. The preparation must be something she could’ve feasibly accomplished in the last few minutes.

Once per scene.

#### Ten Thousand Steps Ahead (Investigation 5, Essence 3) (+8m)
Once per session, the Infernal can pay an eight-mote surcharge to make more dramatic preparations, something that she could have feasibly done in the past day. It can’t be something that resolves the problem outright.
