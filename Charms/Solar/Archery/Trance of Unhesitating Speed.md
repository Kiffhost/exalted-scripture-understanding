The Solar strums her bow and fills the air with sharp notes. This Charm allows the Exalt to attack multiple targets, or a single target multiple times, by spreading her total current Initiative between decisive attacks. Each attack must contain at least three Initiative, and extra Initiative must be spread as evenly as possible between shots. For example, an Exalt with 11 Initiative attacking three targets could make two decisive attacks with four raw damage, and a third with only three. In addition, each 10 she rolls on an attack increases the base damage of that attack by one. The Exaltâ€™s Initiative does not reset until she has completed every attack, and she may not make more attacks than she has ammunition or Dexterity. This attack can be made without an aim action.
