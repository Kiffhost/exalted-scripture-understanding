*The Abyssal’s mournful song laments the impending death of her foes.*
The Abyssal’s performance grants allies who can hear it the following benefits:
 - They gain one [[Initiative]] at the end of each of the deathknight’s turns.
 - They gain an additional point of [[Initiative]] for hitting with a withering attack.
 - Undead allies add ([[Essence]]) dice on attack rolls. This doesn’t benefit undead Exalted.
While performing, the Abyssal can’t take non-reflexive actions.
If the Abyssal uses [[Muse of Death’s Rapture]] (p. XX) to enhance this performance, it increases the [[Initiative]] gained by allies at the end of her turn to two, and converts the dice added on undead allies’ attacks to automatic successes.
