*Like a boulder rolling down a mountainside, the Exalt who gets one taste of victory cannot help but crave more.*
Dealing a blow to her enemy creates a positive feedback loop of adrenaline with her armor, pushing her onward through even the most overwhelming barrage unscathed. Whenever the wearer successfully hits an opponent with a withering attack made with [[Melee]], [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]], she may activate this Evocation to reduce her onslaught penalty by 2. This reduction is proactive: if she is struck after activating the Charm, her [[Defense]] remains unchanged. If her [[Defense]] is at maximum, she would have to take three attacks that round before she got a single point of onslaught penalty.
