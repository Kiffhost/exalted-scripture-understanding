Mihai the Fool has earned his moniker many times over, but his crowning achievement came when he hitched a ride upon the Black Boar himself to harvest the sky-twisting Essence that bled from the Yozi’s great bristles. Mihai survived (though none of his subordinates did) and claimed three bristles (though his original project design would have required six). Ever one to make the best of a situation, Mihai made a different artifact of each bristle. One he fashioned into a spear that could flash across great distances; one he made the core of a jade pillar that could not be moved by any force; and the last he carved into a needle sharp enough to pierce space.

The Sky-Stitch Needle resembles a sewing needle the length of a dagger’s blade. When attuned for five motes, it trails black thread that fades out of sight a yard or so out. It’s exceptional equipment for sewing. Its wielder awakens [[Knot Anchor]] for free upon attuning to it.
