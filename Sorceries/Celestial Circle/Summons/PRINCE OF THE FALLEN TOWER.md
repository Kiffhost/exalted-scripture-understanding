## COMBAT 

[[Attack]] ([[Unarmed]]): 14 dice (Damage 15B/3; see Maker’s Bane) [[Attack]] (Grapple): 8 dice (9 dice to control). Makes unopposed grapple rolls against smaller opponents, unless they use magic like [[Dragon Coil Technique]] (Exalted, p. 280). Combat [[Movement]]: 7 dice Evasion 2; Parry 6 Soak/Hardness: 10/4 

## SPECIAL ABILITIES

Corrupting Touch: The prince may destroy up to 10 cubic feet of mundane wood, stone, or metal as a miscellaneous action. Targeting a worn or wielded object requires a difficulty 3 gambit Maker’s Bane: The prince’s unarmed attack ignores four points of soak or [[Hardness]] from mundane armor and deals aggravated damage to earth and wood spirits. 

## CHARMS

Glory-Blighting Corruption (1m, 1wp; Reflexive; Instant; Decisive-only): Upon landing a decisive attack thatdeals3+levelsofdamage,theprincemaywaiveone level to corrupt an artifact attuned by its victim. The artifact’slightnessdiminishes,imposinga−2mobilitypenalty, and its [[Evocations]] incur a one-mote surcharge. Undoing this requires a major repair project (Exalted, p. 242). Red Rending Fury (5m; Supplemental; Instant): Double 7s on a feat of demolition. Sword-Shattering Sinew (3m, 2i; Reflexive; Instant; Decisive-only, Perilous): Add soak to [[Hardness]] against an attack. Mundane weapons that fail to overcome [[Hardness]] are destroyed. 

## MERITS

Entropic Urge: Any influence that would cause the Prince to cease engaging in destruction is unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220), even its summoner’s orders. Legendary [[Size]]: The prince doesn’t take onslaught penalties from smaller enemies’ attacks (magically inflicted onslaught penalties still apply). Smaller enemies’ withering attacks can’t drop it below 1 [[Initiative]] unless they have 10+ post-soak damage (although attackers still gain the full amount of [[Initiative]] damage dealt). Smaller enemies’ decisive attacks can’t deal more than (3 + attacker’s [[Strength]]) levels of damage with a single attack, not counting levels added by magic.
