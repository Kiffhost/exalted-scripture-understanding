*A Lunar who can’t escape her pursuers grows even deadlier in her desperation.*
To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 10+. She adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on a disengage roll. If she fails, she makes a reflexive decisive attack against an enemy who beat her disengage roll (losing [[Initiative]] for disengaging before she attacks). Each 10 on the disengage roll adds a non-Charm die to her attack roll. If she incapacitates the only enemy who beat her roll, she’s considered to have successfully disengaged. A reflexive attack made with this Charm bypasses [[Bounding Hare Evasion]]’s restriction on attacking in the same turn.
A Lunar with [[Thousand Claw Affliction]] (p. XX) may pay one [[Willpower]] after a failed disengage to instead roll a single decisive attack against each enemy who beat it, dividing her [[Initiative]] evenly among each enemy hit (rounded up) to determine the damage rolled.
