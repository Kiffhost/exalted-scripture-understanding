*Dawnfire Mantle This Evocation may only be used at 15+ [[Initiative]] or !!withinoneturnafteractivatingGoeticCondemnation.!! The Exalt expels her iconic anima through [[Zelator]], unleashing a blast of spiritual power that sends momentary ripples through the [[Essence]] of the world.*
This pulse reaches out to ([[Essence]]) miles, distorting all spells, dispersing all sorcerous motes, and banishing all summoned spirits. Any sorcerous workings caught in the pulse are disrupted for ([[Essence]]) days, suffering sorcerous complications as though theyâ€™d suffered ([[Essence]]) botches during their creation (Exalted, p. 484). This Evocation can be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134). The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
