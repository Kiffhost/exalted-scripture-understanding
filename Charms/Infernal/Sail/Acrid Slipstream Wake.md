*Acidic ichor trails behind the Infernal’s ship, speeding it like a secret current.*

The Infernal’s ship gains +1 Speed. The acid trailing behind it lets other characters add a non-Charm success on rolls to follow her ship’s path. However, the first time an enemy ship succeeds on a ram or boarding action stratagem in naval combat, it suffers one die of Hull damage.
## [[Keys]]
#### Ominous Current Invitation (Sail 4, Essence 2) (+6m, 1wp)
For a six-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, the Speed bonus increases to +2. Characters tracking the ship add two successes, but the Hull damage the acid inflicts increases to (Essence/2, rounded up) dice.
