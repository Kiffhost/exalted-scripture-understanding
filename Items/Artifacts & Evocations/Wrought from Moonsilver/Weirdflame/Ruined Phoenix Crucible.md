Emerging from the ashes like a broken-winged phoenix, a foe is reborn. Wyld-Flame Crucible’s transformations last (wielder’s [[Essence]] x2) days, or ([[Essence]]) months against mortals. The wielder may commit Wyld-Flame Crucible’s cost when transforming a foe with equal or lesser [[Essence]], making the transformation’s duration Indefinite. 

## Resonant

Mortals with [[Willpower]] lower than the wielder’s [[Essence]] can be permanently transformed without committing motes.
