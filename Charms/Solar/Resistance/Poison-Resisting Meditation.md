The Exalt’s metabolism is strengthened by Essence, allowinghertoeasilyenduretheeffectsoftoxins.TheSolargains one automatic success and three bonus dice when rolling (Stamina + Resistance) against a toxin’s duration (p. 232). The Solar can also use this Charm at the toxin’s interval, to reduce or change the anticipated symptoms of a poison or venom. For example, damaged health levels might be converted instead to a dice penalty until the venom runs its course, or poison-induced blindness might be bled out in viscous tears or a gout of sickly black Essence.
