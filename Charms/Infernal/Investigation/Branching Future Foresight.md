*The Infernal perfectly anticipates the villainy of lesser minds, imposing her order over their predictably futile efforts.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after a scene spent actively pursuing an investigation, poring over evidence, or the like. She rolls ({Intelligence or Perception}), banking contingency points equal to her successes. She can use them to advance that investigation, spending them reflexively on the following effects:
- **3 points**: Retroactively reveal the presence of useful informants within the area, equivalent to one-dot Contacts.
- **3 points**: Retroactively reveal that the Infernal is carrying exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for a relevant task.
- **5 points**: Waive the Willpower cost of a resisting influence that would deter the Infernal from pursuing her investigation or deceive her about key facts.
- **5 points**: When using a relevant Awareness, Investigation, Larceny, Stealth, or Survival Charm, reduce its Willpower cost by one. This can’t be used in combat.
- **5 points**: Waive [[Factual Determination Analysis]]’ cost for one scene. This doesn’t include costs or surcharges for its keys.
- **5 points**: After a successful roll with [[Mirror Sees All]], the Infernal can reveal preparations that would have taken a day or so to prepare. However, it can’t be something that would completely solve whatever problem she faces.
- **7 points**: Automatically succeed on a relevant case scene or profile character roll.
- **7 points**: Use [[Imagined Enemy Simulacrum]] to retroactively form a profile of a character involved in the investigation without needing to roll.

The Infernal must know any Charms enhanced with [[Branching Future Foresight]].

#### Smug Foreknowledge Smile (Investigation 5, Essence 3)
Once per story, the Infernal can use this Charm reflexively, retroactively revealing her past involvement in a case. She adds a free full Excellency on the roll and mutes all motes spent on it. This key resets if her investigation faces a significant setback or unexpected obstacle.
