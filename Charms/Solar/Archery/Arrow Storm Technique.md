Seething with remonstrative ire, the Solar palms a storm of Essence and fills the sky with demonstrative fire. With this attack, the Solar unleashes a barrage of arrows around a focus, striking up to (Essence * 3) targets up to medium range from her initial target. Roll a single attack against the defenses of every target, and then apply damage. These extra decisive attacks carry a base damage of her Perception—divvy up her current Initiative evenly among the remaining shots to determine the total raw damage of each attack. Arrows reaching out to medium range from her initial target are expressly allowed to ignore the range limitations of her weapon without penalty. The Exalt’s Initiative does not reset until every damage roll has been completed.
