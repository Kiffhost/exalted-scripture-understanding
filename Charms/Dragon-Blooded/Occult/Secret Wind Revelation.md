Attunedtosubtlecurrentsofspiritualwind,theDragon-Blood can hear a demon’s whispers or a ghost’s tread. When a dematerialized entity comes within long range or closer of the Exalt, the Storyteller informs her player that she may activate this Charm. She rolls (Perception + Awareness) with (Occult) bonus dice opposing its (Dexterity + Stealth) roll to pinpoint his location. A failed roll still reveals the presence of a dematerialized being nearby. However, that entity uses the result of his Stealth roll to establish concealment against the Dragon-Blood until the scene ends or he breaks concealment, escaping her notice even if she later uses Spirit-Detecting Mirror Technique. She cannot use this Charm against the same spirit for the rest of the scene.
