The Solar charges her body and weapon with [[Essence]], unifying the two to unleash a brutal strike that rends her opponent. This Charm can only be used on a crashed target. On a withering attack, extra successes are doubled after the attack roll for the purpose of determining raw damage. On a decisive attack, extra successes from the attack roll are added to the damage roll. If used in conjunction with [[Fire and Stones Strike]], the Exalt simply duplicates up to ([[Essence]] or three) extra successes when paying for damage dice.
