*Invoking baleful power and forbidden wisdoms, the deathknight unleashes countless curses against her foes.*
This Charm upgrades [[Crypt Bolt Attack]]. Upon purchasing [[Accursed Radiance Empowerment]], the Abyssal’s player chooses two of the upgrades below. She can purchase additional upgrades for three experience points or one bonus point each.
The Abyssal can’t combine multiple upgrades on the same attack unless otherwise specified. Some upgrades require a surcharge or can only be used with certain kinds of attacks.
Death’s Cold Caress (+2m; Dual): The deathknight’s crypt bolt takes the form of a freezing wind which can’t be blocked without magic. If it deals 5+ withering damage or any decisive damage, her enemy is rimed in ice, suffering a −2 penalty on physical actions and −1 [[Defense]] for the rest of the scene. He can break free as a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried, or if he takes decisive damage from a heat- or flame-based source.
Eternal Darkness Curse (+3m; Decisive-only): The Abyssal’s crypt bolt takes the form of swirling shadows. If she deals 3+ decisive damage, her enemy is blinded for the rest of the scene, suffering a −3 penalty on vision-based actions.
Eyes-Like-Daggers Glance (Uniform): Entropic radiance lances from the Abyssal’s eyes, letting her use crypt bolts without needing a free hand. This can be combined with other upgrades.
Immolating Pyreflame Blaze (+2m; Decisive-only): Loosing a bolt of pyreflame, the deathknight sets her enemy ablaze if she deals 3+ decisive damage. He suffers (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) dice of lethal damage at the start of each of his turns, ignoring [[Hardness]]. Putting out the flames requires a miscellaneous action that cannot be placed in a flurry.
Screaming Phantom Curse (+3m; Decisive-only): The Abyssal’s crypt bolt takes the form of ravening phantoms. If it deals decisive damage, her victim’s onslaught penalty can’t be reduced below (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) when it refreshes for the rest of the scene. A character with magic capable of striking dematerialized foes can disperse the phantoms with a difficulty 2 gambit.
Soul-Slaying Doom (+2m; Decisive-only): The Abyssal’s decisive crypt bolts deal aggravated damage to ghosts and the living and gain double 10s on the damage roll against them. The souls of mortals slain by them are destroyed, as are ghosts who’re incapacitated by them. This can be combined with other upgrades.
The Abyssal’s player may work with the [[Storyteller]] to create new upgrades.
