*The Infernal emanates an invisible aura of spiritual desolation, subtly poisoning the hearts of those around her.*

The Infernal and all characters within medium range of her add (her Essence) dice on influence rolls to weaken positive Intimacies or instil negative Intimacies. They suffer a −(Essence) penalty on rolls to weaken negative Intimacies or instil positive ones. First Circle demons count as having a Minor Tie of spite toward any character the Infernal has a negative Tie toward, unless they have an opposing Intimacy.
### Keys
#### Broken Prophet Benediction (Bureaucracy 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)
The Infernal can use this Charm on a touched character for a one-Willpower surcharge. This creates an aura that emanates from him, rather than the Infernal. If he’s unwilling, she must make a special ({Charisma or Manipulation}) + Bureaucracy) instil roll against him with double 9s. The Infernal can stack this Charm to affect multiple targets.
#### Withered Soul Wastes ([[#Broken Prophet Benediction (Bureaucracy 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)|Broken Prophet Benediction]]) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm to create an aura that fills a mundane structure or vehicle — a teahouse, caravan, palace, ship, or the like. She can’t enchant things capable of holding more than (Manipulation x20) people, but can affect a smaller portion of such a target.
