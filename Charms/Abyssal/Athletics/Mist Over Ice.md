*Lightening her body with [[Essence]], the Abyssal’s tread becomes as insubstantial as a ghost’s.*
While running, the Abyssal can move over unstable surfaces, even water. She never risks damaging or breaking thin or flimsy surfaces, and isn’t affected by [[environmental hazards]] whose surface she runs over.
This Charm remains active for as long as she continues to run.
With [[Athletics]] 5, [[Essence]] 2, the Abyssal can activate this Charm with instant duration, letting her safely pause on an unstable surface for long enough to complete a single action. However, this doesn’t grant any protection against [[environmental hazards]].
