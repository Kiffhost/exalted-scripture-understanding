*Even an honest man can lie, and the Dragon-Blood knows why.*
She makes a [[profile character]] roll with (Essence/2, rounded up) bonus successes, requiring only a few seconds. Success reveals one of that character’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that he’d be willing to lie to protect. If the character has multiple such [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], the Storyteller should choose the one most directly relevant to ongoing events. For example, if she profiles a character while investigating embezzlement from the Imperial Treasury, she might discover his Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of unscrupulous greed. Using it against the same character amidst a murder mystery might reveal a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to someone else who could be a potential suspect in the case.
