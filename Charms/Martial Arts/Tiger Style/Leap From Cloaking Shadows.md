*The Tiger stylist strikes with such speed that her hands seem little more than blurs of violence, no more substantial than a fleeting pattern of orange and black between the shadowed boughs of the jungle. What enemy can hope to defend against that?*
Leap From Cloaking Shadows doubles up to (half Strength, round up) 9s on an attack roll. Double the same number of 8s if the attack was unexpected or made against an enemy who disengaged or withdrew on her last turn; double that many 7s if both are true. For example, a Strength 5 Tiger stylist made an unexpected attack against an enemy who withdrew on her last turn; she could double up to three 9s, three 8s, and three 7s. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood cannot double 7s with this Charm. 
## Mastery
Every die doubled on the attack roll (including 10s) adds one to the raw damage of the attack.
