The Solar may cast her spirit from her body to save a target from corruption. The Solar steps forward and touches her target, enacting a ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) battle against the character’s [[Resolve]], in which [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] do apply. Upon success, both the Exalt and the target become completely entranced, as the Solar casts her spirit into the body of her target. The exact effect of this dramatic action is up to the Storyteller—the Lawgiver may use this to enter a raksha to retrieve the soul of an eaten loved one, or she might enter the body of her Lunar mate to do battle with a [[Derangement]] created by a past incarnation. More specifically, the Exalt may use this to cast a spirit into her target, forcing a possession of that character, or infecting him with a spiritual malaise if he fails a [[Resistance]] check against the virulence of the attack. This attack requires the Exalt to have previously captured such a spirit or disease using this Charm’s prerequisite.
