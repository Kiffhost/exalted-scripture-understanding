*The Dragon-Blooded mariner can smell trouble on the salty breeze or see a coming storm in red clouds, allowing her to steer safely through monsoons, thunderstorms, and roiling waves.*
She rolls ({Perception or Intelligence} + Sail) against a difficulty based on her familiarity with the seas she’s sailing — home waters might be difficulty 1; a trade route leading to an island she’s never been to before might be difficulty 3; and completely unmapped seas might be difficulty 5+.*
A successful roll lets her flawlessly predict any weather she’ll encounter at sea along the course of her ship’s travel for a single day, letting her foresee even the most freakish natural weather phenomena. She cannot predict the effects of weather-controlling magic. If the Exalt foresees dangerous weather, she gains a temporary [[Sail]] specialty in avoiding or navigating it, which lasts until the weather has passed. She may only have one specialty granted by this Charm at a time.
