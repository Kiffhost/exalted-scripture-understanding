*The Dragon-Blood creates a bond between herself and her Sworn Kin, as well as up to ([[Essence]]) additional characters, allowing them to communicate silently for the duration of this Charm.*
Hand gestures, body language, and other visual signals are as easily understood as spoken language, although only short, simple sentences can be conveyed. Most onlookers don’t perceive this signaling, but a character specifically on watch for such tactics or using superhuman or magically enhanced senses may roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against any participant’s [[Guile]] to notice, but not understand, his signalling.
