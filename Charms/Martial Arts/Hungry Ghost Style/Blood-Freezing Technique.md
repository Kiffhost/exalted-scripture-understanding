*The stylist inflicts the chill of the grave, sending it racing through her victim’s veins.*
The stylist can use this [[Charm]] when a withering attack deals enough damage to reduce an enemy’s [[Initiative]] from being higher than hers to lower, afflicting him with an eerie chill for the rest of the scene.
He suffers a −1 penalty on physical rolls, which increases to −3 on movement actions and other rolls where speed is vital. The chill grows strongest when her victim tries to move away from her, forcing him to [[disengage]] regardless of the distance between them.
## Terrestrial
The stylist can only use this Charm when she crashes an enemy.
