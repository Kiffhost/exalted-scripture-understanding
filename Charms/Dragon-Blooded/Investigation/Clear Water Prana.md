*As flowing water erodes dirt and stone to reveal what hides beneath, so too does the Dragon-Blood’s [[Essence]] wash away attempts at concealment.* 
The Dragon-Blood focuses her attention on a small area, out to close range from a single point. She rolls to case the scene with double 7s; this requires only one minute of concentration to complete. In addition to any clues she finds, she also detects any items that have been hidden in the area as long as she rolls a single success. This doesn’t reveal items that are concealed on a character’s person, or that have been lost rather than purposefully hidden. The Dragon-Blood’s [[Case Scene]] roll is capable of contesting magical concealment such as [[Eye-Deceiving Camouflage]] (Exalted, p. 412). 
[[Clear Water Prana]] can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) by successfully concluding an investigation or using the information gained from one.
