Major projects are significant endeavors within a craftsman’s trade. They include forging battle-ready arms and armor, preparing a banquet fit for a prince’s table or a god’s festival, or sculpting a statue. They place a significant burden on the character in terms of time, materials, or both. 
# Beginning 
In order to begin a major project, the character must have sufficient tools, parts, and the right Craft Ability. The material costs of a major project are often significant, as are the time and energy demands. As such, major projects require the use of a major [[Crafting Projects#Project Slots|crafting slot]]. 
# Slot 
Characters have **3** **major crafting slots** by default. If all three of the character’s major slots are currently in use and the character wishes to begin another major project, an additional major slot can be purchased at the beginning of the project for 5 [[Crafting Projects#Crafting Experience|silver points]]. Such an additional slot vanishes when its project ends. 
# Finishing 
The character must work for a period deemed appropriate by the Storyteller, usually ranging from several hours to several days—occasionally, a major project might even require weeks of labor! Once the character is ready to finish the project, she must spend 10 [[Crafting Projects#Crafting Experience|silver experience points]] in order to make an (Attribute + Appropriate Craft) roll against a difficulty set by the Storyteller. If this roll fails, the character can spend another 10 silver points to try again after a small amount of additional work to bring the project back on-track, if desired. 
# Reward
Successfully completing a major project grants the character **2 gold and 1 silver [[Crafting Projects#Crafting Experience|experience point]]** **per [[Crafting Projects#Objectives|basic objective]] triggered**. If the project was completed exceptionally well (the character’s successes were three or more higher than the project’s difficulty), then she instead gains **3 gold and 1 silver point per basic objective**.
