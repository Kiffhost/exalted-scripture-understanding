The Dragon-Blood’s labors are suffused with the passionate [[Essence]] of fire. She undertakes a basic or major project to craft a painting, sculpture, meal, or similar art object that’s primarily aesthetic or ornamental in function. Major projects benefit from ([[Essence]]) nonCharm dice. She chooses an emotion to be conveyed through her craftsmanship, and treats the [[Craft]] roll used to complete the project as an inspire roll (Exalted, p. 217) to spread that emotion to any character who engages with the object if his [[Resolve]] is beaten by her successes — a painting of a historic battle could inspire courage in those who gaze upon it, while a bowl of noodles flavored with sorrow could bring tears to the eyes of anyone who eats it. This effect lasts ([[Essence]] + [[Charisma]]) days from the project’s completion, after which its supernatural potency fades.
