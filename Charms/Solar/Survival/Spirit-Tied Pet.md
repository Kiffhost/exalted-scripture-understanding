*An Exalt with a familiar has experienced the gift of having been chosen twice.*
The Exalt reaches through her anima to touch the bond she shares with her companion animal, elevating its spiritual status and according herself the following powers:
**Unbreakable Loyalty**: The familiar gains a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to the Solar, if it does not already have one. No influence of any kind—other than that of the Solar—can make the familiar act against this [[Intimacy]]. 
**Essence-Drawing Method**: The familiar becomes a font of spiritual energy. The Solar may reflexively draw up to five motes from her pet once per day. The Exalt must be within short range of the familiar she wishes to tap. If the Exalt taps more than five motes from multiple pets in a scene, the motes she draws will only last until her next turn. 
**Power-Renewing Bond**: The Solar draws strength from her familiar bond. Once per day, through interaction with her familiar, the Exalt may draw a single point of [[Willpower]] as a simple action lasting at least a few seconds. This contact renews the Solar’s mental energies and can even negate a -1 crippling penalty to the Exalt’s social influence actions. The Solar may only use this power once per day, no matter how many familiars she has. 
**Sense-Riding Discipline**: The Exalt may borrow the senses of a familiar through a moment of intense concentration. This simple action requires the Solar to concentrate on pushing her consciousness into the mind of her familiar, rendering her incapable of taking any other actions until she has returned to her own mind. This power can be invoked when the character is asleep or otherwise inactive, and has no known range limitation.
At [[Survival]] 5, the Exalt further extends her influence into the familiar’s motor functions, merging seamlessly with her charge in order to control its actions.

## Sidebar
The first time a Solar uses this Charm, ignore the 1xp activation cost. A Solar with [[Beast-Mastering Behavior]] gains ([[Essence]]) automatic successes to this roll, and shortens the interval of the roll to one week. Using this Charm exempts her from the specialty requirements of normal training, while the Charm [[Friendship with Animals Approach]] may eliminate the penalty associated with wild or hostile animals.

At [[Survival]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, the Solar can teach a familiar she has enhanced with [[Spirit-Tied Pet]] to use magical abilities, such as the eagle’s special ability Iron Wings Carry. Doing so costs the Solar two experience points per ability trained.The player and the Storyteller can work together to develop new and appropriate abilities for the Solar to teach her familiar.

Also at [[Survival]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, the Exalt can use [[Beast-Mastering Behavior]] on a familiar she has enhanced with [[Bestial Traits Technique]], to teach it to use a special ability that it can only use during [[Deadly Predator Method]], for a cost of two experience points. Such abilities need not be wholly appropriate for the animal in question. A flying squirrel might gain the power to generate a charge like an electric eel, while a tyrant lizard might learn to spit a fireball from its mouth.
