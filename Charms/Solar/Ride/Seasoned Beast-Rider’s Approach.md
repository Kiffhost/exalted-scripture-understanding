Drawn steadily to the pulse of battle, the Lawgiver and her mount’s heart beat as one. Normally, if a rider wishes to let her mount attack, it uses up her attack action for the turn. With this Charm, activated when the player rolls Join Battle, the Exalt’s mount gains an Initiative track with a starting value equal to her own, and may make attacks on its own turn. In addition, when the Solar commands her mount to perform a Ride-based movement action, it no longer uses up the Exalt’s movement action for the turn.
