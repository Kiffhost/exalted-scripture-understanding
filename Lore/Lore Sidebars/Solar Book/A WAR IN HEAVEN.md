[[Rakan Thulio]] has been at war with Yu-Shan for centuries. He is far from alone. A handful of Sidereals have bolstered his ranks, each with their own reasons to betray Heaven. Collectively, the conspirators bring to bear intimate knowledge of the divine bureaucracies. They’ve turned the political landscape of Yu-Shan into a battleground, and the city itself into the site of a shadow war between those loyal to the Celestial Bureaucracy and those who wish to see it torn down. Dissident and outcast gods flock to his banner; in exchange for their service, Thulio and his allies promise them new roles in the order to come. 

Even more terrifying are Thulio’s newer allies. Known as the Getimian Exalted, these mysterious agents are walking paradoxes, men and women whom Fate says should not exist. Their magic is every bit as arcane as that of the Maidens’ Chosen, and their master claims that they outstrip the Sidereals in enlightenment and skill. The Getimians undermine the Maidens’ Chosen at every turn, dogging their attempts to shepherd Creation’s destiny. The Sidereals are uncertain where they end and where their foes begin; when they hunt for the Getimians in the patterns of the Loom, they see nothing but the ragged remains of destinies denied and fates rendered null.
