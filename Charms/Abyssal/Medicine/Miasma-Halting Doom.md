*Death’s Lawgiver brings plagues to heel, slaying disease with death-graced hands.*
When the Abyssal treats a disease, she adds (higher of Essence or 3) bonus dice. If she’s successfully diagnosed the disease, they’re non-Charm dice. Against mundane diseases, her victim immediately makes a (Stamina + Resistance) roll against the disease’s morbidity and can use the Abyssal’s successes in place of his own as usual.
If he succeeds and spends at least a day in convalescence, the disease’s intensity is immediately lowered by one step. This Charm can cure incurable diseases.
With a Medicine 3 repurchase, the Abyssal’s treatment roll adds bonus dice equal to her successes on her patient’s next roll against the disease, in addition to its usual effect. Her patients can make immediate (Stamina + Resistance) rolls against supernatural diseases.
