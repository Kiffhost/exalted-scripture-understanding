# [[Crane Style]]
Crane style is a defensive style, emulating the grace of the crane in avoiding the blows of an enemy. Its student learns not just to fight with physical blows, but to empathize with her enemy, speaking or debating with him in an attempt to bring the fight to an end without violence. However, those who mistake the Crane master’s restraint for weakness find themselves quickly meeting the ground. When she must, a student of this style can unleash devastating counterattacks, flowing with the force of an enemy’s blow so she can strike back in turn.
## Weapons
Crane style practitioners typically dual wield a war fan and hook sword, using the fan for defense while disarming enemies with the sword. [[Unarmed]] attacks usually consist of graceful kicks, but a Crane stylist lacking his usual weapons might use one hand to deliver rapid chops while holding back the other for powerful lunges and sweeping blows. 
## Armour
Crane style is incompatible with armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
Many Crane stylists use [[Presence]], [[Performance]], or [[Socialize]] in combat to sway their opponents into peaceful resolution or compromise, and later [[Charms]] of this style empower such efforts.
