The Dragon-Blood adapts to her foe’s attacks, turning his force to her advantage. Every 1 on a withering attack roll against her increases her soak by +1. In Water Aura, this Charm can be used against decisive attacks, granting two points of Hardness, plus an additional point for every 1 on the attack roll, maximum (Stamina) Hardness. This doesn’t stack with other sources of Hardness.
