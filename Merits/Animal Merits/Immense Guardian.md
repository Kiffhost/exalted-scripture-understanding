While a yeddim is generally too dumb and clumsy for its Defend Other actions to significantly increase the Defense of its wards, they have an additional benefit when used to protect its young, allowing the ward to substitute the yeddimâ€™s soak and hardness for its own when resisting the damage of the attack. The yeddim can be trained to receive the benefits of this Merit when protecting its master as a latent ability.
