*Essence and aggression temper the stylist’s body, making her skin as resilient as a bear’s hide.*
The stylist gains +2 soak. While grappling, this increases to (1 + rounds of control) soak. The stylist doesn’t lose rounds of control for being attacked or damaged if her soak reduces a withering attack to minimum damage, her Hardness negates a decisive attack, or an attack deals no damage.

## Mastery
This Charm can be used after the attack roll.
