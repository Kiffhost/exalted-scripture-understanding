Many among the Scarlet Dynasty have heard of Heavenly Typhoon, but few know its true story. The common tale in House Ledaal is that the magnificent chakram was forged in a bygone era by an ancient Dragon-Blood who used it to cut down Anathema through the ages. Inspired by a summer gale, the artisan made a weapon to strike down the unjust like a thunderbolt and cut down the wicked as a storm tears down trees and buildings. Heavenly Typhoon’s real origin is more complex. In truth, Heavenly Typhoon dates back to the First Age, when the Lawgiver Sees-in-Shadow forgd it for her spymaster (and sometimes lover), the Dragon-Blood Rising Storm. Together they uncovered plots, hunted the corrupt, and slew infernalists and blasphemers. Rising Storm passed her drive for retribution unto her lineage. In the Usurpation, Rising Storm’s granddaughter took up Heavenly Typhoon and struck down Sees-in-Shadow, grown wicked in the centuries since Rising Storm’s death, at the cost of her life. Over a thousand years later, it would be discovered by a distant descendant and scion of House Ledaal, drawn to the Anathema-slaying weapon by their shared lineage. Heavenly Typhoon is a blue jade infinite chakram. Orichalcum inlay on its cloudy, marbled surface resembles a jagged bolt of lightning. Viewed from another angle, the pattern looks like bared dragon fangs.
