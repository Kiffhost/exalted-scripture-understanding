*The sorcerer shapes a slender needle of prismatic light and looses it into the sky, where it explodes into a swarm of sparkling constellations. The false stars linger in the sky, tracing lazy orbits that entrance all who look upon them.* 
The sorcerer makes a (Manipulation + Occult) roll, doubling 9s, against the Resolve of everyone other than herself within a mile who can see the open sky. Those overcome by the spell stare contentedly at the lights unless provoked or endangered, taking only reflexive actions. Characters can enter a Decision Point and cite a Major or Defining Intimacy that compels them to resist, allowing them to spend one Willpower to shake off the enchantment. Actions that don’t directly serve or flow from the cited Intimacy suffer a −2 penalty, as their minds return time and again to how pleasant it would be to look back up at the display. At the end of the spell, anyone entranced loses all memory of the spell and what happened during it, as per arcane fate (p. 141); some savants suggest, in half-remembered accounts, that this wasn’t always the case.
## Control
The sorcerer can shape dazzling displays of light which count as exceptional equipment to entertain, distract, or inspire feelings or joy and wonder. When using this to enhance social influence, she may spend anima to add one non-Charm success for each level spent. 
## Distortion
(15)
The sorcerer may spend one [[Willpower]] to free up to ([[Essence]]) characters at short range from the spell’s entrancement. Characters freed this way must roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) against the original caster’s ([[Manipulation]]) at the end of the spell, or else forget the events as normal.
