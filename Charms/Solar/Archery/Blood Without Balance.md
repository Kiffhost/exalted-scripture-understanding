Drawing upon the perfect moment to shoot, the Solar sees nothing but her target. Upon becoming the beneficiary of a distract gambit (p. 200), if the Solarâ€™s new [[Initiative]] would allow her to act immediately, she may use this Charm to fire a ranged decisive attack from up to long range without an aim action. In addition, if the Lawgiver has under seven [[Initiative]], the base damage of this attack gains ([[Essence]]) bonus dice.
