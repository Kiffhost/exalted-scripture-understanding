*Death’s Lawgiver veils herself in darkness, vanishing into the night.*
While the Abyssal is in darkness or dim light, other characters whose visibility is impeded by it can’t notice her unless they specifically have reason to search for intruders in the dark or if she takes overt action, like Joining Battle or displaying superhuman prowess. Even then, the visibility penalty subtracts successes instead of dice from [[Perception]] rolls against her.
Magic that lets characters see unimpeded in darkness doesn’t negate this Charm’s concealment unless they have a relevant [[Intimacy]] toward the Abyssal, or a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that her presence threatens.
