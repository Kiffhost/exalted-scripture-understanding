*The Infernal need not check and recheck the perfection of her designs. Implementation is efficiency.*

The Infernal warps time around her to complete a [[Basic Project|basic]] or [[Major Project|major project]] with incredible speed. Most projects can be finished in seconds or minutes if she has all the necessary tools materials. The most arduous, work-intensive projects can be completed in an hour for basic projects or a day for major projects.

If the Infernal uses this Charm to create something that provides a significant advantage while pressed for time, she gains an additional silver point.
### Keys
#### Temporal Efficiency Optimization (Craft 5, Essence 2) (+4m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a four-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to complete most [[Superior Project|superior]] or [[Legendary Project|legendary projects]] in (6 – Essence) weeks. Creating a five-dot or N/A artifact or manse takes that many months instead. This doesn’t accelerate takes that aren’t directly related to using Craft, like gathering resources or recruiting laborers. Projects that are heavily dependent on such efforts, like manse construction, typically take at least a season to complete.
