The Solar may strike aside even the falling sky. When struck with a decisive attack, the Solar retroactively channels her Initiative to strike away harm—burning away successes on the damage roll at a rate of one success per one point of Initiative. Any successes she is unable or unwilling to strike away still register as injuries, removing an equal number of levels from her health track. An attack which is completely nullified by Heavenly Guardian Defense seems to strike the Solar at first, but then is turned aside by the blurring interposition of her blade. Heavenly Guardian Defense allows also the Solar to guard against damage deemed impossible to parry, such as unexpected attacks, hurled bolts of acid or lightning, the burning curses of Kimbery and so on, for just four motes. This Charm may also be invoked in or out of combat for four motes, one Willpower, to strike away uncountable recurring damage without using the Solar’s Initiative. As an island is disintegrated by the sky-shattering blast of a supervolcano, the Solar turns aside the heart of the explosion with the skill of her blade. Use of Heavenly Guardian Defense causes no harm to the Exalt’s weapon.
