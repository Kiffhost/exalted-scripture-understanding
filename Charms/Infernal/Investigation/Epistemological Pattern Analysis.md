*Reality quivers in pain as the Infernal’s mind bores a hole into the past, extracting truth at its source.*

The Infernal makes a special case scene roll to tap into echoes of the past, asking a question about a past event that occurred in the area. The difficulty is 3 by default, but may vary based on how long ago the event took place. If she succeeds, the answer to her question revealed to her through brief, fractured flashes of the past. Details from the distant past are almost often vague or ambiguous.
## [[Keys]]
#### World-Memory Echo
The Infernal may glimpse the past instead of asking a question. She experiences about a minute’s worth of past events that occurred at that location, choosing a specific point in time to view, though no more than (Essence x10) years ago. She can use multiple questions for this to extend how long this vision is, but must use them all consecutively to view the same course of events.
