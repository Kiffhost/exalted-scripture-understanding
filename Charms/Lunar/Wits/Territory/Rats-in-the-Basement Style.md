Even when cornered, the Lunar is always one step ahead of her pursuers, revealing a secret pathway to safety. She can use Magpie’s Nest Resourcefulness within (Essence) miles of a lair prepared with Secure Den Technique to reveal a hidden route to the den, rolling at difficulty 5. These routes are concealed in the same manner as the den itself. It takes at most an hour to travel from the route’s beginning into the den. The Lunar can’t have more than (Essence) hidden routes created using this Charm. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size, the Lunar can reveal routes traversable only by characters of similar size.
