*The Abyssal’s enemies are already prisoners to their own despair; all that is necessary is to demonstrate this truth.*
When the Abyssal uses Frozen Fears Blossom against an enemy with a Major or Defining Principle instilled by Gracious Gift of Despair or a similar Intimacy, she may pay a one-mote, one-Initiative surcharge to imprison him in ice. If the Abyssal uses Gracious Gift of Despair together with Frozen Fears Blossom to raise such a Principle to Major or Defining, the strengthened Intimacy can trigger this Charm.
If the counterattack deals damage, the Abyssal’s attacker is encased in rime, inflicting a −3 penalty on physical rolls and preventing him from taking movement actions. This penalty subtracts successes instead of dice on rolls to attack the Abyssal or to oppose her disengage rolls.
Breaking the enemy out of the ice requires a Strength 3 feat with difficulty (Intimacy + 2). Alternatively, he can be freed by magical fire or heat, but only if it deals 1+ decisive damage to him.
With Essence 3, the Abyssal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm against an enemy who only has a Minor Principle.
