*Emptying her mind of distraction, Death’s Lawgiver unleashes subconscious nightmares to guide her craft.*
When the Abyssal uses Perfection of Bleak Design on a major, superior, or legendary project, she adds a nonCharm success for each failed die that’s rerolled into a success.
If a rerolled die shows a 10, or a number that the Abyssal’s doubled with Void Demiurge’s Art, she adds an additional non-Charm success.
