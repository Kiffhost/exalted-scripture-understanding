Situated at the edge of the Scavenger Lands, the wealthy and ancient city of Thorns has been a lynchpin of trade and travel for centuries. Its beautiful architecture is widely held as a marvel of Second Age achievement. 

Thorns paid tribute to the Realm for better than twenty generations, and served as the Scarlet Empress’s largest military outpost abutting the Scavenger Lands. 

In RY 764, the year after the Empress vanished, Thorns fell to the dead. 

The Mask of Winters advanced on the city at the head of an army of zombies and mercenaries, riding atop the back of the terrible and forgotten abomination known as Juggernaut. Juggernaut was a fearsome behemoth slain in the forgotten epochs of the First Age—a terror with fists the size of hills, the bulk of its flesh like a city wrought in muscle and sinew. The Deathlord found the behemoth’s ancient corpse and enslaved it through unimaginably potent sorceries, raised his citadel upon its rotting back, then set it crawling toward the city. 

The Dragon-Blooded of the Thorns garrison rode forth to confront the Deathlord’s forces, only to be cut down in the space of an hour by the Abyssal Exalted who emerged from the corpse-fortress’s shadow. This was Creation’s first introduction to Death’s Lawgivers. 

The Mask of Winters could have conquered the city that same day: Juggernaut could have easily pulled down the walls, and the Abyssal Exalted gone reaving through the streets. Instead he settled in to siege. He sent rats to eat the city’s food, and sickness to taint its air. As the people starved, he released pigs into the streets; the skeletons of those who ate of their cursed flesh tore their way out from the screaming bodies encasing them. In the end, he made the people of Thorns open their own gates and invite him inside. He made them beg him to deliver them from the horrors he had brought. 

The Mask of Winters was glad to oblige. Thorns is now the center of a new, swiftly-growing shadowland, and the capital of the Deathlord’s nascent empire. His cold, hungry eyes now settle upon the River Province to the north.
