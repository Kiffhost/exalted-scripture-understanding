The Solar sinks into the colorless field of her Essence,  joining with the form of nothingness. This Charm allows the Exalt to make a Stealth attempt even if there is no cover available—so long as the Solar is standing still or moving slowly, she blends perfectly into her surroundings. While this Charm is in effect, her Stealth attempts garner (Essence) automatic successes. Extreme movement renders her temporarily visible. Any time she attacks or changes range bands, she can be seen and targeted by opponents until her next turn in which she doesn’t. If she is struck by a withering or decisive attack, the Charm ends.
