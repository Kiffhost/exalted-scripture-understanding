Mounts usually need saddles. Working at speed, it takes a master stabler five minutes to tack a horse—a process that involves affixing a blanket and saddle, bit and bridle, crown and boots. Barding, similarly, is applied after tacking, and even the fastest cataphract requires a minimum of five minutes to fully deck a destrier in armor. After that, if the animal is to carry any special weapons, they take a minute each to affix. Mounts of a similar size to horses—agata, claw striders—take about the same amount of time to equip. Larger mounts such as mammoths or tyrant lizards take twice as long. Page 591 has the rules for characters themselves equipping armor; rushing a mount’s equipment uses those rules.
