*The Immaculate forces the air from her enemy’s lungs, denying him Mela’s precious gift.*
To use this Charm, the Immaculate must have [[Initiative]] 12+. She makes a decisive attack against an enemy. Before rolling decisive damage, she rolls (her weapon’s Overwhelming) dice of unsoakable withering damage. She doesn’t gain [[Initiative]] from this damage roll; if she crashes her enemy, the [[Initiative]] Break is added before she rolls decisive damage and resets to base. 
**Beings that don’t need to breathe, such as zombies and automatons, are unaffected.** 
If an enemy that takes withering damage from this attack is holding his breath (Exalted, p. 232), the total number of rounds he may do so for is reduced by one. [[Essence]] is the breath of spirits, rendering them especially vulnerable to this technique. They lose motes equal to the withering damage they suffer.
