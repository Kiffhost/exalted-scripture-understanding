Upon awakening this Evocation, the wielder of Daring Venture gains the legendary wolf [[HUNDRED RIVERS, THE WANDERING WOLF|Hundred Rivers]] as her familiar. She may activate it to call the wolf to her current location. No matter how great the distance between them, he’ll travel towards her as fast as possible.
