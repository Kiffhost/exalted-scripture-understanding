*Eager for bloodshed, the Abyssal cuts down her prey before they can even draw their blades.*
When the Abyssal rolls Join Battle, she rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10. If she wins Join Battle, she may reflexively make a withering or decisive attack against each of up to (Dexterity) enemies.
Slaughter-Swift Acuity is incompatible with Charms from other combat Abilities that enhance Join Battle rolls.
With a Thrown 5, Essence 3 repurchase, when the Abyssal makes a decisive attack with this Charm, each 9 or 10 on the damage roll adds +1 to her base Initiative upon resetting.
