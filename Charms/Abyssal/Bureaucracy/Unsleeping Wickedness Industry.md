*Unmatched in her foreplanning, the Abyssal relies on her servants to fulfill her will at the moment when it matters most.*
As the Abyssal spends a scene engaging with the business or members of an organization she leads, her player retroactively reveals a project that the organization’s completed (Exalted, 226). The project must be feasible to the organization’s nature and resources. For example, a trade consortium could corner a market or organize a caravan with a mercenary escort but would struggle to enact laws or repair a city’s infrastructure.
