*The deathknight’s scything rebuke delivers far more than sevenfold vengeance.*
The Abyssal can use Charnel Emperor Rebuke and Coiled Shadow Strike against the same attack for a total cost of seven motes, one Willpower, waiving the restrictions of the Counterattack and Clash keywords.
If she wins the clash, she doesn’t roll damage until after Charnel Emperor Rebuke’s counterattack, which adds its decisive damage to the clash attack’s damage roll.
