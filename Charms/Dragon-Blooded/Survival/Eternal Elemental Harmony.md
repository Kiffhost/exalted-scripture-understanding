*The Dragon-Blood is one with the five elements, capable of dancing with lightning and walking through wildfires.*
This Charm can be used upon failing a roll against an environmental hazard. The Exalt rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Survival]]). Every success reduces the hazard’s damage by one die. If the hazard inflicts no damage on the Exalt, she gains a point of temporary [[Willpower]]. This Charm’s elemental aspect is that which most closely matches the nature of the hazard it’s used to protect against. If the Dragon-Blood is in the Elemental Aura that matches this Charm’s aspect, the duration of its protection lasts for as long as she remains in Aura, subtracting dice of damage based on her initial roll. She can only gain [[Willpower]] once, even if she withstands multiple hazards without taking damage.
