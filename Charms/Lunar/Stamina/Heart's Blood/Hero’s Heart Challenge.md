*Testing her fortitude against a worthy rival, the Lunar claims his face as a trophy of her triumph.*
She performs a sacred hunt to claim a human’s shape by challenging him to a physical contest — a footrace, wrestling match, duel, drinking contest, etc. If the Lunar wins, she may conclude the sacred hunt and claim her opponent’s form by accepting a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of respect toward the opponent — if she deems him unworthy, she can’t gain his form. This counts as the [[Intimacy]] needed to take a human shape (p. XX). Winning by cheating is valid if the Lunar isn’t caught, but her opponent must be genuinely trying to win. If the Lunar’s target wins or catches her cheating, the sacred hunt fails, and she can’t take his shape through this Charm for the rest of the story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means.
