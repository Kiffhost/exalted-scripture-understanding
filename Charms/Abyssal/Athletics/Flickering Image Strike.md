*The deathknight outpaces her enemy with impossible speed, surrounding him with ghostly afterimages that seem to strike from every angle.*
When the Abyssal attacks an enemy at close range whose Initiative is lower than hers (prior to paying this Charm’s cost), she rolls (Dexterity + Athletics) opposing his (Perception + Awareness). If successful, the attack becomes a surprise attack, imposing a −2 penalty on her victim’s Defense against the attack.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Abyssal’s Initiative and then rising to Initiative 6+.
