*All things belong to death; the Abyssal merely hastens its inevitable claim.*
After successfully stealing an object from someone, the Abyssal makes a special (Manipulation + Larceny) instill roll against him. If successful, the target believes that the object belongs to the Abyssal and always has.
He can resist for one Willpower but must wait at least (Abyssal’s Essence) minutes to do so, giving her time to flee the scene.
