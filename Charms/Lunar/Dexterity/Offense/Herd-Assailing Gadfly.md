*A wasp’s sting can be as deadly as any dagger; a cat’s claws, an executioner’s blade.*
When the Lunar makes an attack in an animal shape with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] (p. 185) against a larger enemy, she ignores those Merits’ drawbacks, dealing damage normally.
The first time the Lunar uses this Charm in a scene, her attack becomes a surprise attack (Exalted, p. 203).
