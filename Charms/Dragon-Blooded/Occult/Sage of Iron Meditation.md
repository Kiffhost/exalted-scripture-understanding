*Her will tempered by the blood of dragons, the Exalt imposes order onto chaos.*
She may spend up to ([[Stamina]]) days in meditation. As long as her focus remains unbroken, the Wyld abides by the natural laws of Creation out to short range from her, and cannot cause any mutation, addiction, or other warping to characters in that range. She gains [[Hardness]] 20 against attacks made by creatures of the Wyld, and such beings within short range of her lose two [[Initiative]] at the start of each turn as long as she continues meditating. Crashed creatures of the Wyld suffers a single die of aggravated damage instead. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] by defeating a creature of the Wyld.
