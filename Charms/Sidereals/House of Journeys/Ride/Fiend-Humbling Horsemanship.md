*The Sidereal binds devils to Heaven’s service, teaching them humility and repentance as they bear her on her journeys.*
The Sidereal creates a stardust bridle and makes a (Dexterity + Ride) gambit to place it on an un-Exalted enemy of fate within close range. The gambit’s difficulty is (higher of target’s Essence or base Resolve). Success turns her enemy into a horse, though it doesn’t diminish his intellect. His new form has a noticeably otherworldly appearance that reflects his true nature. This has the following effects
- When he takes a physical or Perception-based action, he uses the horse’s dice pools instead of his own if they’re lower (3 dice for actions without a listed pool).
- He must use a horse’s Parry, Evasion, soak, and Hardness instead of his own if they’re lower.
- He can use a horse’s natural weapons and gains its innate special abilities and Merits.
- He must allow the Sidereal to mount and ride him as long as it doesn’t rise above the level of an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216), as a Psyche effect. If his Essence is lower than the Sidereal’s, he’ll do so even if it’s a serious task. This doesn’t prevent him from harming or opposing her, as long as he does so in ways that won’t cause her to fall off.
- If his Essence is lower than the Sidereal’s, he can’t use Charms or any other magic. Characters with Essence 6+ are immune to this effect.
This transformation lasts (1 + Initiative roll extra successes) days. Against characters with Essence 1-3, the Sidereal may inflict a permanent transformation, though she may subsequently reverse it or set a condition by which he may do so. Permanently transformed characters will let the Sidereal ride them even if it’s a life-defining task.
The Sidereal can bind a permanently transformed character as her familiar for as long as he remains in that shape. She may choose to restore his access to Charms and other supernatural powers and let him use the better of his traits or the horse’s.
With Essence 4, the Sidereal can use this Charm reflexively when she defeats a valid target — whether in combat, debate, commerce, an exorcism, or the like. No gambit is required; the transformation lasts for a year and a day unless she can make it permanent.
