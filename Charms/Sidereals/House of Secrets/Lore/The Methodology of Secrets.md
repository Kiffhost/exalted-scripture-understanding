The Sidereal is possessed of unusual competences, employing methods and techniques only dreamt of. The Sidereal applies a Lore specialty to an action with another Ability. She might use a mathematics specialty on an engineering project, a specialty in Yu-Shan for bureaucratic dealings, or a metallurgy specialty to target a weak spot in an enemyâ€™s armor.
