The Solar is filled with rampant greed, no longer willing to let anything come between him and what he wants.
Whenever he is faced with the opportunity to indulge in a favorite pleasure or vice, he will do so. If someone would deny him a pleasure, he will take it by force, even if it would be trivial to obtain it otherwise. While he can restrain himself from committing acts of murder or rape, he will not hesitate to destroy property or physically harm others to get what he wants – but only after he’s done enjoying it.
Rampaging Avarice can be ended prematurely if the Solar harms an innocent in order to get what he wants—but only after he’s done enjoying it.
