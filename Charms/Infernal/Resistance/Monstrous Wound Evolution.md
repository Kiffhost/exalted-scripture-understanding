*Maimed and mutilated, the Infernal reveals the abomination hidden behind her façade of humanity.*

When the Infernal suffers a crippling effect, she can use [[By Rage Recast]] to manifest any of her chosen mutations that relate to the injury, instantly raising her anima to bonfire. If her arm is hacked off, two more monstrous limbs might burst outward from the stump as she manifests Extra Arms. If she doesn’t have any relevant mutations, she still undergoes a superficial transformation. This can only defend against effects that involve injury to the Infernal’s body — it doesn’t apply to penalties from being stunned or the like.

The Infernal’s transformation reduces any crippling penalty she suffers by (Essence/2, rounded up). If she has a relevant mutation, the penalty is reduced to one — or negated entirely, if it was already −1 after this Charm’s reduction. Once the Infernal’s anima falls to dim, the mutations recede as usual. If she waits until the end of the scene or later before reaching dim, her injuries are fully healed when the mutations fade.
