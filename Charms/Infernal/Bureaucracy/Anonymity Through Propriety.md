*It is not the place of inferiors to pry into the lives of the great and powerful.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Bureaucracy) persuade roll. Characters with Resolve lower than her successes will pay no attention to her or her affairs. While they remember the encounter, they steadfastly refuse to think about or even discuss his encounter with this obviously important and powerful personage for this Charm’s duration.

If a character is the Infernal’s inferior in an organizational, political, or social hierarchy, this counts as a Minor Intimacy supporting the Infernal’s influence. This category always includes First Circle demons. Conversely, her hierarchical superiors count as having a Minor Intimacy that opposes the influence. This does not automatically include Second and Third Circle demons.

A character can spend one Willpower to resist this influence if the Infernal directly and overtly interacts with him or if she threatens one of his Major or Defining Intimacies. He can also do so if another character succeeds on a persuade roll to convince him to pay attention to the Infernal or talk about the encounter, treating this as an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216).

This Charm ends if the Infernal makes an attack, rolls Join Battle, or takes a similar hostile action.
## [[Keys]]
#### Unquestioned Presence Fiat (Bureaucracy 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one day. The Intimacies imposed by the Charm count as Major, and its influence costs an additional Willpower to resist unless the target has an Intimacy that opposes it.
