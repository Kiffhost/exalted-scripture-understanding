# Jade
The currency of the Realm's Dynasts.

| Denomination     | Per Ledger Talent | Per Obol |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Bit (unofficial) | 4096              | 4        |
| Obol             | 1024              | 1        |
| Shekel           | 128               | 1/8      |
| Mina             | 64                | 1/16     |
| Bar              | 8                 | 1/128    |
| Talent           | 1                 | 1/1024   |
A physical talent of Jade weighs 68 pounds, and are traditionally used in the construction of [[Manse]]s. Values in the above table represent "ledger talents", as cutting down physical slabs of jade to pieces of the correct weight is difficult and wasteful, losing a significant mass of jade in powder (powdered jade is known as "Imperial bootblack" and is a valuable crafting material in its own right). For this reason, physical talents are actually equivalent in weight to 12 bars. Most of this loss occurs when cutting shekels to obols. 
Obols are the most circulated physical currency, though bits are also a widely used denomination, despite being illegal to own for commoners and "discouraged" for Dynasts.
# Cash
The official currency of the Realm's mortals.

| Denomination | Per Yen | Per Obol |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- |
| Koku         | 128     | 8        |
| Qian         | 16      | 64       |
| Siu          | 8       | 128      |
| Yen          | 1       | 1024     |
Koku and qians are paper notes, while siu and yen are copper coins. One qian is an approximate weeks wage for a skilled commoner, while one yen is a days wage for unskilled labour.  
# Silver
The currency of the threshold.

| Denomination | Per Dinar |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Dinar        | 1         |
| Dirham       | 400       |
| Talent       | 1600      |
Almost nobody goes to the trouble of forming a physical 64 pound talent of silver, and only rarely the 16 pound bar called a dirham. Most silver trade happens by weight or fraction of dinar coins. A dinar approximately covers the month income of a skilled commoner household, and is worth slightly more than a koku, often interchangeable at the scale of household finance.
# Other
In the West, the red cowrie shell is used as the standard unit of value. The shells must be very fine to have much worth, and are drilled and strung together in groups of 25, 50 or 100. They’re not much valued outside of the West, but in that region, they’re worth three silver dinars to the shell, or six shells per obol. The Empress didn’t accept the West’s tribute in cowrie shells, but allowed the West to retain a functional means of exchange even as she stripped them of silver coinage. It is for this reason that silver is given a favorable exchange rate, and jade penalize
