The Sidereal endures whatever ordeals her job might require, persisting through to the end of her shift. The Sidereal ignores up to (Stamina/2) points of penalty on a physical roll with any Ability, adding them as bonus dice. This doesn’t affect environmental penalties, penalties for poor lighting, and other penalties based on factors external to her. If the Sidereal’s performing menial labor for an employer, this Charm’s duration is extended for the entirety of her shift.
