Within three miles of this hearthstone, fires spread more slowly and become more difficult to ignite. Even with optimal tools and kindling, starting even the smallest fire is a difficulty 1 task, and accidental fires are extremely rare.
Marking a stove, hearth, kiln or forge with a special sigil and saying a short prayer once a month at noon allows fires to be kindled and to burn normally in these locations, but these fires are unlikely to spread beyond these locations.
Arson and attacks with flaming projectiles cause at most minimal damage in a region protected by this stone, while forest fires and prairie fires are exceptionally rare.
