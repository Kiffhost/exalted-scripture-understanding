Every movement of the Exalt’s body is suffused with emotional intensity. Her Appearance adds non-Charm bonus dice to an inspire roll made through dance based on her target’s Resolve (Exalted, p. 218). Any social influence that she or her allies subsequently use against that target in the same scene that’s supported by the inspired emotion gains an automatic success.
