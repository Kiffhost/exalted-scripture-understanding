*Like an ember that burns an unsuspecting hand, the Exalt strikes suddenly from ambush and vanishes as quickly as she came.*
When she rolls to establish concealment in combat, she doubles 9s. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when a Dragon-Blooded Sesus scion attunes to the [[Smiling Razors]]. 

## Resonant

If the wielder is resonant with jade, a surprise attack made with the [[Smiling Razors]] on the turn after entering concealment with this Evocation adds one automatic success on the damage roll.
