*The Abyssal unleashes a psychic howl, giving voice to the Neverborn’s mad wrath against the gods who betrayed them and the kin who abandoned them.*
The Abyssal rolls a single decisive attack with (Charisma + Occult) against all enemies within long range, adding (higher of Essence or Whispers) automatic successes. This attack is unblockable and undodgeable but is resisted by the targets’ Resolve.
This ignores all cover and can affect dematerialized enemies.
The attack has a base damage of (Essence + Whispers) against each hit enemy, and the Abyssal divides her Initiative evenly among them, rounded up. This deals aggravated damage and ignores Hardness. Damaged characters suffer the effects of Soul-Warping Whispers.
Trivial characters don’t count toward the Initiative division — they either die on the spot, collapse in writhing agony, or flee at the Abyssal’s choice.
This psychic onslaught can’t be perceived by those who aren’t targeted by it, as with Screaming in Silence.
