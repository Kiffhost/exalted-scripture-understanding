*The Abyssal is sustained by slaughter, reaping vitality from those dead by her hand.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she incapacitates a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack. She rolls dice equal to the levels of damage she dealt, maximum ([[Stamina]]), and heals one level of nonaggravated damage for each success. She can only feed on the living and ghosts — animated corpses, automatons, and their ilk offer no sustenance.
If the enemy was within close range of the Abyssal, she can reflexively drink the blood from his wounds, letting her reroll 1s until they cease to appear.
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack with 20+ [[Initiative]].
