The Lunar becomes the legion, the horde, the pack, the stampede. She splits off countless copies, becoming a virtual battle group with [[Size]] (Essence/2, rounded up) and base Magnitude 10 (regardless of her total health levels). She adds ([[Size]]) dice on attack rolls and withering damage rolls, +([[Size]]) soak and Magnitude, and can make area attacks and engage gambits (Exalted, pp. 208-209). Her area attacks are incompatible with Simple [[Charms]]. She must pay one [[Initiative]] each turn after activating this Charm to maintain it. Unlike most battle groups, she doesn’t have [[Drill]] or [[Might]], her [[Initiative]] isn’t inert, she can use [[Charms]], and she can make both withering and decisive attacks, using the same rules as [[Hungry All-Consuming Cloud]] to resolve attacks with multiple targets. She can’t benefit from command actions or [[Charms]] that specifically enhance battle groups. The Lunar’s Magnitude is separate from her health track, representing the destruction of her duplicates, not harm to herself. Each time she loses a dot of [[Size]], she doesn’t make a rout check, but instead rolls ([Dexterity or Wits] + [[Integrity]]) to maintain this Charm. On a failed roll, this Charm ends and she suffers a level of unpreventable lethal damage. This Charm can only be used once per scene. It can’t be used in shapes with Minuscule [[Size]] or Legendary [[Size]]. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Minuscule [[Size]] may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm.
