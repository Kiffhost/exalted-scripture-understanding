*When this gray-streaked blue gem is socketed into an attuned artifact, its bearer may call up short, choppy gusts of wind to obstruct enemy projectiles for one scene as a miscellaneous action, imposing a one-die penalty on ranged attacks against her.*
Unexpected attacks ignore this penalty. She can also use the winds to blow out candles, scatter papers, or cause equally minor disturbances within short range.
