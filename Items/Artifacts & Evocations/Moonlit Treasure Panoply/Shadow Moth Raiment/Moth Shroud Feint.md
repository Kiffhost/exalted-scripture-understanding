Fluttering moths emerge from the raiment, concealing its wearer behind a veil of black wings.
Successfully dodging an attack obscures the wearer from her attacker. He suffers a −3 penalty on vision-based rolls opposing her until the end of her next turn. The first attack she makes against him while he’s suffering this penalty is a surprise attack, inflicting −2 Defense.
The wearer loses this Evocation’s benefits if she attacks a different enemy.
With an Essence 2 repurchase, the wearer can pay a two-Initiative surcharge to swarm all enemies within short range with moths, inflicting this Evocation’s penalty on them as well as her attacker. The wearer can make a surprise attack against any of them, though this benefit is still limited to only her first attack.
## Resonant
The wearer can use this Evocation after the attack roll.
