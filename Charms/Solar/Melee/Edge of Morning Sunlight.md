The Lawgiver concentrates on manifesting her [[Essence]] through the medium of her weapon. Investing her attack with Solar power, she strikes a vicious blow against demons, undead, and other creatures of darkness. On an attack that accrues at least one success on the damage roll, she may activate this Charm. Her weapon glints at the point of impact, slicing her foe’s corpus with purifying [[Essence]]. Roll ([[Essence]]) damage dice against her target’s health track. This damage roll ignores hardness.
