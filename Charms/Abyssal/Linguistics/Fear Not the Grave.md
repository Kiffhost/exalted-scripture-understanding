*The Abyssal teaches that death is not a thing to be feared, only a step along the path to freedom in nonexistence.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [[Linguistics]]) instill roll to compose a missive to a single target:
morbid poetry, philosophical arguments, bleak evangelism. Success extinguishes her target’s fear of death, with the following effects:
 - He gains +2 [[Resolve]] against fear-based influence based on threats of death or physical violence to him.
 - His Intimacies related to fear of death or harm are weakened by one step.
 - His Intimacies related to acceptance or celebration of death count as one step higher.
 - Fear of death plays no part in his decisions — a revolutionary attacks a tyrant heedless of her guards, a monk protests an unjust law by fasting unto death, etc. Acting against this requires entering a Decision Point and citing a Defining [[Intimacy]], or a Major [[Intimacy]] if danger is imminent.
This influence can only be resisted when the target faces a significant risk of physical harm. He enters a Decision Point and may cite a Defining [[Intimacy]] and spend three [[Willpower]] to end this effect.
With an [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, affected characters become immune to applicable fear-based influence, and suppress Intimacies related to fears of death or harm completely. They can only resist if faced with a risk of death, not just injury.
## Reset
