*To look upon Death’s Lawgiver is to witness the inevitable end of all things.*
The Abyssal makes a (Appearance + Presence) instill roll against any number of characters who can perceive her to instill a Principle related to death or a Tie of awe, fear, or obedience towards the Abyssal. She converts dice added by her Appearance to non-Charm successes. This costs two Willpower to resist; doing so renders a character immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene.
For this Charm’s duration, instilled Intimacies count as one step stronger to determine what tasks they’ll support for the Abyssal’s persuade rolls (Exalted, p.
216) and increase the cost to resist persuade rolls that leverage them by one Willpower.
