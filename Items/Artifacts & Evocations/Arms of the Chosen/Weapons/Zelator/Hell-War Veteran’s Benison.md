Knowledge of ancient battles against warlocks and devils shines forth from the Exalt’s weapon and spreads across her soldiers, crowning each in a nimbus of righteous power. This Evocation supplements a command action directed at a friendly Might 0 battle group that’s engaged with at least one supernatural enemy, blessing it with Might 1 for the rest of the scene. 

## Resonant

The battle group gains Might 2 instead.
