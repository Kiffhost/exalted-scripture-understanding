*Wise in nature’s mysteries, the Lunar is a master of efficacious medicines and death-dealing venoms.*
The Lunar can use [[Night’s Mercy Panacea]] on [[Craft]] and [[Survival]] rolls that involve medicinal herbs. She can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to double 8s on a [[Medicine]] roll to make use of such herbs or a [[Craft]] or [[Survival]] roll involving them.
Alternatively, the Lunar can pay the one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use this Charm on an attack that can poison an enemy or when she otherwise doses someone with poison. His 1s on the roll against it subtract successes. If the Lunar uses [[Mamba-and-Cobra Mastery]] (Lunars, p.
258), his 1s count as her 10s for its effect.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape is venomous or poisonous may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm, with [[Adder Fang Method]] (Lunars, p. 258) as its prerequisite.
