Unison and its wearer act as one. When the wearer takes an action that upholds a Defining [[Intimacy]], she gains a non-Charm bonus success. The armor’s methods change depending on action — for a mental action, Unity supercharges the wearer’s [[Essence]] flows, making her mind work faster, while for physical tasks it infuses her muscles with its [[Essence]] or changes its density.
