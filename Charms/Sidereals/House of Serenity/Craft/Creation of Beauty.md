The Sidereal plies her raw materials with honeyed words and winsome grace, bringing forth their hidden beauty. The Sidereal adds ([Appearance or Charisma] / 2) non-Charm dice on a [[Craft]] roll. If she’s creating something as a gift for someone else, this increases to ([[Appearance]] or [[Charisma]]). Any penalties she suffers from lacking equipment If the Sidereal’s working with raw materials to which her [[Elemental Vision]] applies or has an applicable [[World-Shaping Artistic Vision]], this increases to ([[Appearance]] or [[Charisma]]).
