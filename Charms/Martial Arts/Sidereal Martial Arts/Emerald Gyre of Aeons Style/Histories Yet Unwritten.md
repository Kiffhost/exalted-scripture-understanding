*Contemplating who she is and who she may become, the stylist takes on the power and the pain of her future.*
Upon learning this Charm, the stylist’s player chooses five [[Martial Arts]] Charm or [[Charms]] compatible with [[Martial Arts]] attacks or parries. She must meet their prerequisites, but can use the [[Charms]] she picks to meet the prerequisites for others chosen with this Charm. Using this Charm causes the stylist to experience a flood of memories and emotions from a possible future self, gaining access to up to ([[Essence]]) of these [[Charms]] for five motes each. However, this communion with her future self changes who she is in the present — she must change one of her Major or Defining Intimacies in a way that reflects a profound change that might happen in her future. For instance, she might change a Tie of love to a Circlemate to one of heartbreak.
The stylist can go into experience debt (p. XX) to learn a Charm she’s chosen for [[Histories Yet Unwritten]]. The training time necessary is divided by her ([[Essence]] + [[Lore]]). If she learns one of the chosen — either by going into debt or paying experience normally — she chooses another Charm to replace it.
## Enlightenment
The stylist may choose her Exalt type’s native [[Charms]] for [[Histories Yet Unwritten]] even if they aren’t compatible with [[Martial Arts]]. Once per story, she can use this Charm during downtime to access a qualifying Charm that she hasn’t chosen for it.
