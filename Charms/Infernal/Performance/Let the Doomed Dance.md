*The Infernal entreats the ill and infirm to rise from their sickbeds — who knows if they will ever dance again?*

The Infernal’s performance grants allies the following benefits:
- They gain a temporary −4 health level. It’s the first to be filled when they take damage to her −4 levels. The temporary level and any damage in it vanish at the end of the scene. If the Infernal stops performing before then, the damage shifts into the ally’s normal health levels.
- They reduce penalties from wounds, crippling effects, and deprivation by (Infernal’s Essence) total, or negate them entirely for dance-based Performance rolls.
- Withering attacks against them suffer a penalty to raw damage equal to half their wound penalty, rounded up, maximum −3.

While performing, the Infernal can’t take non-reflexive actions.

If the Infernal has an Intimacy based on positive feelings for the doomed or dying, the temporary health level improves to −2 for Minor, −1 for Major, or −0 for Defining. She adds (Intimacy/2, rounded up) to the amount of penalties negated and the penalty to raw withering damage.
