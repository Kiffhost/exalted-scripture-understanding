The force of countless blows strikes not as they land, but all at once, sending enemies spiraling away from the stylist as they impact. The stylist makes a withering or decisive attack. If she crashes her target or 3+ decisive damage, the impact of the blow is held in abeyance, as is that of subsequent attacks against him. (They still deal damage normally). At the end of the round, the enemy experiences each impact simultaneously sending him one range band away from the stylist’s position when she used this Charm, plus an additional range band for each other attack that’s hit him since then, maximum long range. If the enemy collides with an object or surface, he suffers damage as per a fall of the same range (Exalted, p. 232) — or, if only sent back to close range, suffers (Strength) dice of decisive damage, ignoring Hardness This is normally bashing, although some objects may inflict lethal damage. The total damage successes also count as a feat of demolition to destroy the impacted object or surface, adding +1 to the stylist’s effective Strength to determine what feats she can accomplish for each range band the enemy was flung back. Alternatively, this Charm can be used purely for a feat of demolition, rolling (Strength + [Athletics or Martial Arts]) with a free full Excellency, adding +5 to her effective Strength to determine what feats she can accomplish. She can attempt feats of strength that would normally be impossible for her size and leverage, letting her target objects or portions of structures extending one range band beyond what she could normally accomplish. With Essence 5, this increases by one range band per five extra successes. Enlightenment: This can knock an enemy out to (Essence) range bands. Collision damage can’t exceed that for a long-range fall.
