*A fearsome witch-god come to take the measure of mortals, the Lunar uncovers a person’s truest self in that which he seeks most desperately to hide.*
She performs a sacred hunt to take a human’s shape by seeking out a secret of great importance to him — one that persuading him to reveal would count as a serious or life-defining task (Exalted, p. 210). Once the Lunar uncovers this secret, she may conclude the hunt, taking her target’s form. However, if she’s mistaken as to the secret’s significance or truth, the hunt fails, and she can’t take her target’s shape through this Charm again this story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means. Once the Lunar takes someone’s form with this Charm, she retains it permanently, even if the secret’s later revealed. A single secret can only be used to take one person’s shape, even if it applies to many.
