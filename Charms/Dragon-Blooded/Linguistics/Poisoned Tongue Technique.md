The Dragon-Blood insinuates her influence into another’s conversation, subtly manipulating his voice’s tone and cadence by controlling the air he speaks through. When a character within short range makes a spoken influence roll, the Dragon-Blood may use this Charm to roll (Manipulation + Linguistics) against his Resolve. Each threshold success on her roll subtracts one die from his influence roll. In Air Aura, if the Dragon-Blood succeeds, (Essence) 1s on the penalized roll subtract successes from it. With War 3, the Dragon-Blood can use this Charm to penalize an enemy’s command action, disrupting the communication between a commander and his troops.
