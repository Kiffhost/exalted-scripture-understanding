Embodying monstrosity and divinity, the Lunar shapes societies by her praise or punishment. When she uses Herd-Strengthening Invocation (p. XX), she may pay a nine-mote surcharge to make a (Charisma + [Performance, Presence, or Socialize]) instill roll with (Essence) automatic successes against all audience members with Defining Ties toward her. Affected characters are instilled with a Defining Principle embodying the designated custom. While Herd-Strengthening Invocation is active, they can’t voluntarily erode that Principle, and may treat any influence it opposes as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). Characters can’t immediately spend Willpower to resist — instead, they must pay three Willpower each day on (Lunar’s Essence) different days to break the influence. This doesn’t remove the Defining Intimacy, but lets them begin voluntarily weakening it.
