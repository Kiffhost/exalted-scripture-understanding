*The Sidereal may not escape unscathed from her enemies’ wrath, but accepts whatever sacrifices are necessary without flinching.*
When the Sidereal takes a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201), the damage roll retroactively suffers +1 target number. If this reduces the damage beneath the amount negated by the injury, the Sidereal suffers a commensurately less severe wound, or none if she takes no damage. If the battle supports a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of duty, the damage roll suffers +2 target number and the injury doesn’t count against the once-per-story limit.
