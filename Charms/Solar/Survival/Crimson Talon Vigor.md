The Lawgiver and her familiar fight as one. With this Charm, the familiar learns to read the Exalt’s momentum, flowing with her attacks as if it were part of the Solar’s [[Essence]]. For each successful withering attack the Solar lands against an opponent, the familiar gains bonus [[Initiative]] equal to half the [[Initiative]] drained by the attack, rounded up. This bonus may not exceed the Solar’s [[Essence]] score. This Charm must be repurchased for every familiar the Solar wishes to enhance with its effect.
