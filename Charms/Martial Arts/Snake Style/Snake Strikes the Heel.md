*Those who tread on serpents may not live to repeat their error.*
This Charm allows the martial artist to reflexively make a withering or decisive clash attack. A withering clash does not grant any [[Initiative]] to the martial artist, only serving to disrupt the momentum of her enemy with the blurring violence of her unexpected attack. A decisive clash can only be used to execute a gambit, potentially including a reflexive activation of [[Crippling Pressure-Point Strike]] to use one of its gambits. If the martial artist knows [[Uncoiling Serpent Prana]], she may activate it as though it were a Reflexive Charm to allow her to clash against a ranged enemy with [[Snake Strikes the Heel]]. 
## Terrestrial 
A Dragon-Blood treats the clash attack granted by this Charm as her action for the round, and cannot make another. If sheâ€™s already acted this round, then it counts as her action for her next turn.
