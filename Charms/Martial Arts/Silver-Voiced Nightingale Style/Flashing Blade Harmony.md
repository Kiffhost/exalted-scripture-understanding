*Humming deeply in her throat, the Nightingale causes an ally’s weapon to resonate with vibrations of [[Essence]], redoubling the force of his attacks.*
Whenever an ally within short range of the Nightingale makes a decisive attack, she may use [[Flashing Blade Harmony]] to apply the double 10s rule to the damage roll. Withering attacks benefit from double 9s. If the martial artist makes a kiai against an enemy who has already been hit by one or more of her allies’ attacks that benefitted from [[Flashing Blade Harmony]] in the same round, the resonance of the multiple attacks combines to create a devastating vibration. She adds one die to the post-soak damage of the kiai for each such attack, and applies double 10s or double 9s on her own damage roll, as appropriate to the attack type. She does not need to activate [[Flashing Blade Harmony]] to gain this benefit on her own attack. 
## Mastery
The martial artist may transfer up to ([[Essence]]) points of [[Initiative]] to an ally when she enhances his decisive attack with [[Flashing Blade Harmony]].
