Through use of this Charm, the Solar gains an intuitive feel for a marketplace at a given instant, allowing her to intuit roughly how much a given object will fetch in any one market. Though the Exalt need not be physically present in the market, this Charm must be used with a particular sales venue in mind. The Solar cannot discover previously unknown markets through use of this Charm. She can, however, review distant markets to determine which would be the best to sell a good. The more specific the venue contemplated, the more accurate the forecast. A Solar using this technique can make a perfectly accurate assessment at the moment of sale, but the longer she waits between using this Charm and the actual sale of the goods, the larger her margin for error, as economies shift with time.
