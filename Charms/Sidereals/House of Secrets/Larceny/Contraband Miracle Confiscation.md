*Pulling at the threads of an enemy’s fate, the Sidereal purloins a part of his divine might.*
The Sidereal makes a (Wits + Larceny) gambit against the Resolve of an enemy within short range to steal one of his supernatural powers. The gambit’s difficulty is (enemy’s Essence, maximum 5). Success lets her steal a non-Excellency Charm, Evocation, or spell for the scene. This can’t affect Permanent effects. If the gambit succeeds, the target can’t use the stolen power for the rest of the scene. If it’s currently active, it ends.
If the stolen power is a Sidereal Charm, Eclipse Charm, or Martial Arts Charm, the Sidereal can use it for the rest of the scene as long as she meets any Ability or Essence minimums. (She doesn’t need to satisfy prerequisite Charm requirements). This also applies to Evocations, as long as the Sidereal wields an artifact that Evocation can feasibly be used with. She can cast stolen spells if she’s initiated into the appropriate circle of sorcery or necromancy.
If the Sidereal meets all requirements to learn the stolen power (including prerequisite Charms), she can incur experience debt (p. 169) to learn it permanently. This can be used to learn Eclipse Charms. This Charm’s victim still regains the stolen power normally once the scene ends.
This Charm’s victim can reclaim the stolen power by crashing or incapacitating the Sidereal.
## Reset
Once per scene.
