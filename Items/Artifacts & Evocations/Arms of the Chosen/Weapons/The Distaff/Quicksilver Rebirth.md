How long must a sword wait to be reborn? The Exalt opens the silken chrysalis of the Distaff and sets Dragonfly free. This Evocation destroys the Distaff’s silk and unique magic, replacing them with something new. The sword reborn is an Artifact 3 moonsilver daiklave, its temperament, powers, and Evocations determined by how the Exalt wielded the Distaff. Used peacefully and compassionately, with little or no violence, the fledgling blade’s magic is beneficent. But if the Exalt turned the Distaff to brutal use as a bone-breaking cudgel or silken garrote, Dragonfly reborn is a vicious, bloody blade. All experience spent on the Distaff’s Evocations is refunded; any or all of that experience can be spent immediately on Dragonfly’s Evocations with no training time. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience. It requires the Exalt to have wielded the Distaff for an entire story; and she must confront an obstacle beyond the Distaff’s power, that only a daiklave’s keen edge can overcome. As Quicksilver Rebirth calls for the creation of a wholenewEvocationset,invokingitrequiresStoryteller permission. 

## Dissonant

If the Exalt is dissonant with moonsilver, she requires training time to unlock Dragonfly’s Evocations.
