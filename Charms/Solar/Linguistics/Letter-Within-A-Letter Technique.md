By carefully injecting allusions, subtle stresses and loaded word choices, the Exalt can imbed a secret message in a document of seemingly innocuous character—a shopping list, a bill of lading or even a quickly dashed note. The Solar must be familiar with the recipient in order for him to see the hidden missive. The hidden message can be no longer (in words) than half the length of the cover document. Magic that can break the Solar’s code automatically costs an additional Willpower and must beat a difficulty of the Solar’s Linguistics or the highest difficulty of any magical encryption inscribed into the text.
