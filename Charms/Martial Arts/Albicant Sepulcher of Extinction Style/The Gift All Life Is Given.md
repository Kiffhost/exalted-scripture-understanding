*Each thing is born with the seed of its death within it. With a gesture of benediction, the bleak saint bids them flower into oblivion.*
The stylist radiates entropic [[Essence]], rolling ([[Strength]] + [[Martial Arts]]) as a [[Attack#Gambit|gambit]] against all enemies within medium range, opposed by their ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) rolls. Instead of making separate [[Initiative]] rolls for each enemy, the stylist makes a single roll at difficulty 1 and pays the gambit’s cost once.
Affected characters suffer a −1 penalty on both withering and decisive damage rolls and −3 [[soak]] and [[Hardness]] for the rest of the scene from diminished vitality and corroded gear. The stylist can spend her Initiative roll extra successes to increase the damage penalty by one for two successes, maximum −3, and increase the soak and Hardness penalty by one point for one success, maximum −5.
If the stylist’s Initiative roll successes exceed an affected enemy’s own [[Initiative]], she can also spend extra successes to destroy his equipment. Destroying mundane objects costs one success each. Against artifacts, she can spend ([[Artifact]] rating − 1) successes to break their attunement, This entropic aura also damages unattended objects and portions of structures within the Charm’s range.
If the stylist’s successes equal the difficulty of a feat of demolition to destroy something, it decays or corrodes instantly as long as she meets the feat’s strength minimum. Things made of organic materials are most susceptible to this, reducing the effective difficulty and [[Strength]] minimum by ([[Essence]]/2) to determine this Charm’s effect on them. Even if she doesn’t meet a feat’s Strength minimum, beating the difficulty still weakens the targeting, reducing the difficulty and effective Strength minimum of further feats to destroy it by (Essence/2, rounded up).
## Enlightenment
When the stylist breaks an artifact’s attunement, she can pay three additional successes to damage it so badly that it’s rendered nonfunctional until repaired (Exalted, p. 242).
## Reset 
Once per scene.
