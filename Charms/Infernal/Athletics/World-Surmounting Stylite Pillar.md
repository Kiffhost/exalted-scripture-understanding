*The Infernal demonstrates her perfection, ascending to a pinnacle of enlightenment beyond her lessers’ reach.*

A pillar of basalt emerges from the ground beneath the Infernal, carrying her up to two range bands upward. This uses her movement action. Enemies within close range of her when she uses this Charm must make a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Athletics) roll, falling prone if they fail. There must be a solid surface capable of supporting a pillar — she couldn’t use it on a teahouse’s second floor or atop another pillar.

Characters can climb the pillar with a reflexive move action, but must succeed on (Strength + Athletics) roll at difficulty (Infernal’s Strength) to do so. Enemies whose permanent Willpower is lower than the Infernal’s suffer a penalty equal to the difference, maximum −5.

If the Infernal uses this Charm to reach close range with an airborne enemy and then uses [[Argument From the Peak]] to attack, she ignores flurry penalties and adds one die of decisive or post-soak withering damage. If her permanent Willpower is higher than her target’s, she instead adds dice equal to the difference, maximum five. She also gains this bonus if she leaps down from the pillar to attack at close range.

At the end of the scene, the pillars recede back into the earth.
