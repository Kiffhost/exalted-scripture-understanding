*Drawing her raging anima inward, the Solar’s offense is renewed in a sudden burst of flashing, streaking fire.*
When the Exalt’s anima is at bonfire, she may use this Charm to make an additional attack, even if she’s already attacked that turn. The Exalt moves like ice on hot metal, expelling her anima with her attack and returning her to the dim level.
