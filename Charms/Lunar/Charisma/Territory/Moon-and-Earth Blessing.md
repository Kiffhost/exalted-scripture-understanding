Pacing the boundaries of the land she wishes to bless, the Lunar blazes marks onto trees and stones or carves patterns into the earth, suffusing the landscape’s geomancy with fertile Essence. She labors from sunset to sunrise, blessing a region of up to (Essence) square miles, or the entirety of a territory claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation. The blessed region’s flora and fauna grow more abundant, and even the most barren climes become capable of sustaining life. Rolls to forage, find shelter, navigate wilderness, or endure mundane environmental hazards within the region gain two successes. The land is occasionally marked with uncanny strangeness: flowers blooming only at night, will-o’-the-wisps haunting the edges of gardens, owls flocking in greater number than other birds, etc. This blessing lasts a year and a day, or — if used within the Lunar’s territory — for as long as she holds dominion over it.
