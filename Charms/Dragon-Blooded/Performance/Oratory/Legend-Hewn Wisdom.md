Dragon-Blooded storytellers pass down lessons of history and tradition, ensuring that societyâ€™s foundation remains strong. She rolls (Charisma + Performance) to inspire an audience with emotion by telling a story. In addition to creating the chosen emotion, this influence also instills targets with an Intimacy based on the moral or allegory of her story, either creating it at Minor intensity or strengthening an already-existing Intimacy. A Performance 5, Essence 3 repurchase allows the Dragon-Blood to pay one Willpower to grant a temporary point of Willpower to any character that allows the influence to succeed without applying his Resolve. This Willpower may only be spent to resist influence that opposes the Intimacy instilled with this Charm. A character may only benefit from this effect once per day.
