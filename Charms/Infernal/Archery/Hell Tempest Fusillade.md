*The Infernal's bow looses an omen-storm to rival even the Typhoon of Nightmares, letting her fury rain down on a worthless world.*

The Infernal makes a special decisive attack, firing an arrow directly upward instead of targeting a specific enemy. As long as she rolls at least one success on the attack roll, her bolt bursts into a swirling storm cloud that rains down arrows across the battlefield as an environmental hazard. She still makes a damage roll and resets to base Initiative.

The environmental hazard forms above the Infernal, at up to a maximum of her weapon’s range, and extends out to medium range. Its difficulty equals the Infernal’s attack roll successes, and it deals lethal damage equal to (Infernal’s damage roll successes/3, rounded up) per round, or (Essence)L if that’s higher. It doesn’t affect the Infernal or her allies.

Most offensive Charms' effects don't apply to the environmental hazard, except to the extent they benefit the attack or damage roll. However, if the Infernal enhances the attack with [[Euphoric Cloudburst]], [[Passion-Immolating Lightning]], or [[Storm-Temper Excitation]], their effects apply to all of the hazard's damage rolls.

The storm of arrows lasts until the end of the scene. It can be dissipated prematurely with a ranged gambit. The storm's effective Defense against the attack is (Infernal's Essence + 3), and the gambit's difficulty is 7. The storm can also be disrupted by magic capable of dispelling supernatural weather.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset when an enemy dissipates the Infernal's storm.
## [[Keys]]
#### Skyline Annihilator Devastation (Essence 5) (+10m, 1wp)
Once per story, the Infernal can pay a ten-mote, one-Willpower surcharge while at Initiative 20+ to unleash a cataclysmic storm. The hazard’s damage increases to (Infernal’s damage roll successes/2, rounded up). At the start of each of the Infernal’s turns, the hazard expands one range band in all directions and moves one range band forward. She can use her movement action to reflexively change the direction it moves in or prevent it from moving that turn. Once the scene ends, the storm persists for at least (Essence) hours, but its difficulty and Damage both fall to (Infernal’s Essence + 5) if they were higher. The Storyteller determines how much damage it deals to mundane scenery and trivial opponents, up to uncountable damage. It continues growing as a Storyteller-determined rate, to a maximum of one mile in all directions. It becomes significantly faster, covering (Infernal’s Essence x 5) miles per hour, but the Infernal can no longer redirect or halt its movement. It can’t be disrupted except by magic capable of dispelling supernatural weather.
