*With every brushstroke, the artist shapes a dream of the world as it could be — until at last, there is no difference between dream and reality.*
## Resonant
Only characters resonant with the [[Resplendent Dream Brush]] can awaken this Evocation.
The painter invokes a Defining [[Intimacy]] to undertake a mundane superior [[Craft]] (Painting) project (Exalted, p. 243). She paints her surrounding environs, but with a notable change to their landscape that relates to the invoked [[Intimacy]]. She might change a river’s course, add a forest, or erase one mountain from a range to improve her manse’s view.
The end result must be one that could exist naturally — she couldn’t fill a barren tundra with fields of wheat or make a river run up a mountain. The change can’t destroy anything other than natural features or cause harm. If she creates a mountain on top of a city, its buildings are transplanted to the mountain in roughly the same configuration. If she creates a lake over a besieging army’s encampments, the enemy’s soldiers will be able to swim to safety rather than drowning.
When the artist uses this Evocation, her location becomes the seed of this transformation, and her painting must remain there for the entirety of the project. Her changes are limited to the area within ([[Essence]] x5) miles of the painting. If the change would impact a location that’s controlled by a supernatural being, formally or informally, his player may veto changes that affect his domain or propose alternatives. Players may also do this for changes that affect their attuned demesnes or manses, or similar holdings.
Once the artist completes her painting, all of existence seems to flicker, like when a sleeper nearly wakes but falls back into dream. When the world returns, the change in the painting now exists in reality. Everyone but the artist remembers the landscape as if it had always been that way. This is a Shaping effect, but magic that specifically protects against memory-altering Psyche effects can also be used against it.
Within the Wyld, the artist can reshape the landscape entirely rather than making only a single change. She may pay five white craft points to make the landscape real, forming an island of Creation amid the chaos. The changes aren’t integrated into others’ memories; such continuity is superfluous in the Wyld.
The artist must remain within the affected area for the project’s duration. As she works, a glamour falls over the area. Those within may have dream-like visions in which both landscapes paradoxically coexist or psychedelic experiences in which the world is artistically stylized.
Characters using magic like [[All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight]] (Exalted, p. 356) can roll ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) at difficulty 7 to sense the glamour. The difficulty falls to 5 within ten miles of the painting and to 3 within one mile. Characters who roll 3+ extra successes identify the rough distance and direction toward the painting, and can identify it as the magic’s source if it’s in view. Fae can make this roll without needing any magic and add ([[Essence]]) automatic successes.
Once a character has sensed the coming transformation, they can avert it by destroying the painting in progress.
However, it’s no mere thing of canvas and paint. A feat of demolition to destroy it requires [[Strength]] 5 and has difficulty 10, and other approaches to destroying it are similarly challenging. Mundane environmental conditions, like catching flame or being immersed in water, can’t harm the painting.
Even if they’re unsuccessful in averting the transformations, characters who’ve sensed it won’t have their memories revised when it occurs.
A Lunar with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]] (Lunars, p. 176) may claim the transformed region as a territory.
She can have up to ([[Essence]]) such territories beyond that Charm’s limit.
