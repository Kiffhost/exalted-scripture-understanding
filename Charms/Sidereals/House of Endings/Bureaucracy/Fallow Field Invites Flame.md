*The Sidereal breathes a chill miasma through the halls of power, winnowing away those whose indolence or corruption weakens an organization.*
The Sidereal infects an organization with a disease called fallow fields affliction, a supernatural blight that harms only those unfit for their posts. She can’t affect groups with more than 100 members, but she can limit the infection to a smaller subdivision of an organization.
Before she can use this Charm, she must spend a day interacting with the organization’s leadership or a substantial number of its members.
Once the Sidereal has done so, she rolls (Strength + Bureaucracy) to exhale a miasma of purple stardust.
The leader can oppose this with a (Manipulation + Bureaucracy) roll if his player is unwilling. However, he can’t roll to resist if the Sidereal has been officially authorized to audit or investigate the organization. If she succeeds or is unopposed, the leader and every mortal member of the organization is automatically infected with fallow fields affliction. Other members roll (Manipulation + Bureaucracy) opposing the Sidereal’s roll, in place of the disease’s virulence. New members who join the organization are likewise exposed to the disease.
The disease doesn’t harm the diligent. As long as an infected character performs his official duties scrupulously and refrains from any corruption, the disease manifests no symptoms, held in perpetual incubation.
The disease is specific to the organization the Sidereal used this Charm on: if an infected character neglects a job he has in a different organization, the disease won’t manifest.
Committing even a single act of corruption causes the disease to manifest at Minor intensity, as does consistently neglecting one’s duties or performing them inadequately. Once the disease manifests, it has morbidity (Sidereal’s Strength), and is resisted with (Manipulation + Bureaucracy). It an interval of one week and the following symptoms:
### Minor
The victim suffers a mild fever and cough, with occasional droplets of oil in his sputum. He suffers a −1 penalty on Bureaucracy rolls that are contrary to the organization’s interests. If he has a negative Tie to the organization or a Principle that supports corruption, deception, or indolence, the penalty increases to –(Intimacy).
### Major
The victim is wracked with coughs, spitting up black oil and moldering hay. The disease’s penalty now applies to any action he takes that threatens the organization’s wellbeing or prosperity as a whole. It doesn’t penalize actions in combat.
### Defining
The victim’s cough becomes so severe he struggles to breathe, and his fever reaches a dangerous peak. Once per day, when he engages in corruption or neglects his duties, he suffers one die of lethal damage from the fever, ignoring Hardness. If he has one of the Intimacies described above, he suffers (Intimacy) damage dice instead. If this incapacitates a character without Exalted Healing, he dies of the disease.
### Death
The victim bursts into flame, crumbling into ash over the course of a few seconds. This conflagration rarely causes more than superficial damage to anything else that’s not on the victim’s person, leaving his surroundings largely unscathed.
Medical treatment is useless against fallow fields affliction unless enhanced by magic. As long as an infected character belongs to the organization, he can’t be cured of the disease — at best, treatment can only keep it from progressing beyond Minor intensity. This can be overcome by Charms and other magic that specifically aid in treating disease, like Terminate Illness (p. 313). If a character is cured, he doesn’t risk reinfection.
If a character quits the organization while his infection is still latent, he’s cured. If he’s already infected, the disease remains, but loses its supernatural power, changing to consumption (Exalted, pp. 234-235). This doesn’t render it contagious. The same occurs to all infected characters when the Sidereal ends this Charm.
