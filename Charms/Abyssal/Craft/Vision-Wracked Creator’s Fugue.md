*Descending into her soulâ€™s dark depths, the Abyssal harnesses wild genius and unfettered imagination with iron will.*
After five minutes in meditation or sleep, the Abyssal may exchange craft points of one type for another.
She may exchange silver points for gold points or gold points for white points at a rate of two to one, or white points to gold points or gold points to silver points at a rate of one to two. Each activation only allows her to convert one type of craft points.
