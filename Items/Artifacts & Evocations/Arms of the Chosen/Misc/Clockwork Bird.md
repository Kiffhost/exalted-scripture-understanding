§ = [[FIRST AGE ARTIFICE]]

These blue jade automata resemble songbirds small enough to fit in the palm of one’s hand. Attuned for one mote, a clockwork bird moves as though alive. Though it can sing and flit to entertain its owner, it’s most commonly deployed as messenger or courier. Given the name and location of a person in the same realm of existence, it flies unerringly to him at a speed of 100 miles per hour to deliver a message no more than one minute long, and/ or a small, light object such as a parchment or necklace. Perching near the recipient, it conveys its message in its owner’s voice — along with social influence, though not social [[Charms]] — repeating twice as needed, and listening for a return message to give its owner.

Much rarer versions of the clockwork bird, their feathers banded with orichalcum, trace back to the First Age and the inaccessible montane workshop of the god Vanileth, Shogun of Artificial Flight. Only the [[Solar Exalted]] were known to make more; even the Realm’s finest artisans cannot replicate them. Ordinary clockwork birds, for all their prodigious memory, are scarcely smarter than actual songbirds. **Vanileth’s birds** possess human intellect, great eloquence, and personal initiative, making them excellent — albeit unusual — envoys and secretaries. Their delicate clockworks are sorcerously hardened ice, kept frozen only by rarefied essence of air filling their innards to provide buoyancy
