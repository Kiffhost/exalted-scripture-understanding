*The Dragon-Blood can banish artifact armor into one of the five elements, dissolving her [[hauberk]] into water or letting the whirling wind divest her of armor piece by piece.*
She may send attuned jade armor Elsewhere through a significant and dramatic manifestation of the chosen element: it might vanish as she walks through fire, dissolve as she meditates beneath a waterfall, or be drawn beneath a tree’s bark or into the rocky surface of a boulder or stone pillar. She may use this Charm to retrieve the armor from a similar elemental manifestation, donning it as though donning it normally (Exalted, p. 591). If the Exalt doesn’t have access to an appropriate elemental manifestation, she may expend a level of anima to banish or recall her armor. Once banished this way, it may be recalled through a manifestation of her Aspect element.
