*Shrouded in the terrifying darkness of her anima, the Abyssal’s spiritual pressure scatters heroes and armies alike.*
To use this Charm, the Abyssal must be at bonfire [[The Anima Banner|anima]]. She makes a reflexive [[threaten]] roll against all characters within long range who can see her, ignoring multiple target penalties and the [[Resolve]] bonus for using body language (Exalted, p. 221). Affected characters must flee from her, and affected [[battle group|battle groups]] also suffer a −3 penalty on rout checks. Trivial opponents and mundane animals normally can’t assert their [[Resolve]] against this influence or spend [[Willpower]] to resist it, although the [[Storyteller]] may allow certain such characters to do so under extraordinary circumstances. This costs one [[Willpower]] to resist, plus an additional five [[Initiative]] in combat.
In combat, the Abyssal repeats this roll on each of her turns.
