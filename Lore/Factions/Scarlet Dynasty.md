The [[Hierarchy of the Realm#Perfected Hierarchy|subjects]] and dominion ([[Realm Geography|the Realm]]) of the [[Scarlet Empress]], including the entire [[Realm Geography#Blessed Isle|Blessed Isle]] (split into many *prefectures* and larger *dominions*), and the many *satrapies* that funnel wealth from [[Creation]]'s [[Threshold]] back to the centre of the Realm's power.
Composed of a complex [[Hierarchy of the Realm|Hierarchy]] devised by the [[Scarlet Empress|Empress]], in practice much of the power is wielded by the Dragon-Blooded [[Hierarchy of the Realm#Perfected Hierarchy#Dynasts|Dynasts]] who make up the [[#Great Houses]].
