*Secrets weigh heavy on the heart, drawing the Sidereal’s investigation to unwilling witnesses.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm after a successful case scene roll, letting her learn about someone familiar with the events she investigated. This only reveals those who have something to hide about the event. It can’t detect people who are already willing to volunteer what they know.
The Sidereal receives only partial information about the witness, which may or may not include his name, general appearance, or usual whereabouts. However, she’ll always receive enough information to find the witness if she follows up on it. The Storyteller can skip directly to this interview if the group isn’t interested in playing out this process.
If the Sidereal succeeds on a profile character roll against the witness, she confirms his identity in addition to that roll’s usual effects.
