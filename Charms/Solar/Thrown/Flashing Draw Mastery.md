The breathtaking speed with which a Lawgiver calls a weapon to hand is often the last miracle her opponent sees. This Charm adds a single automatic success to the Solar’s Join Battle roll, and treats her roll as if she scored (Essence + 1) additional successes for the purpose of determining attack order in the first round of combat. These successes are not “real”—they neither increase her Initiative, nor do they count as dice added by Charm. Flashing Draw Mastery is expressly permitted to be used in combination with Charms that boost Join Battle results, so long as they are not based in Archery, Melee, or Brawl.
