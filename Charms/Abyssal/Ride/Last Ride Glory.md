*So merciless is the deathknight that she will willingly ride her steed to death in pursuit of victory.*
The Abyssal doubles her mount’s Speed Bonus. Mundane animals almost always perish from such exertion at the end of the scene unless the deathknight uses [[Ridden to the Bone]] with this Charm, in which case the steed is merely exhausted instead, requiring immediate rest.
This Charm ends if the Abyssal is crashed. However, ending it prematurely doesn’t spare her mount.
