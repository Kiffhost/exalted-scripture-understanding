Once per scene, the Lunar may pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Quicksilver Second Face to reflexively activate Towering Beast Form (p. XX) or Emerald Grasshopper Form (p. XX). Additionally, while Constant Quicksilver Rearrangement is active, reduce both Charms’ costs by four motes. Waive this Charm’s Willpower surcharge and once-per-scene limitation if the Lunar uses Towering Beast Form while already in a Legendary Size shape, or Emerald Grasshopper Form while in a Minuscule Size shape.
