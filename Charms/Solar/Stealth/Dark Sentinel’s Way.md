While using a defend other action on a subject, a hidden Solar may use this Charm to conceal her defense of that subject. Upon parrying an incoming attack, the Solar flickers briefly into view, then vanishes, returning her to concealment as if she had never left it. The Solar must be within close range of her subject or otherwise using Charms which allow her to apply defend other benefits from beyond close range.
