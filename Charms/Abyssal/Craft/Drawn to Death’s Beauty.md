*Who can look away from death? The Abyssal’s works draw in those who gaze on them like moths to folly’s candle.*
The Abyssal can pay a four-mote surcharge when she uses [[Magnificent Cenotaph Allure]] to imbue her art with death’s mesmerizing allure. Characters affected by Magnificent Cenotaph Allure’s influence are also compelled to approach and claim her work. This fascination can be exploited as though it were a Defining [[Intimacy]]. They suffer a −3 penalty on [[Perception]] and [[Awareness]] rolls to notice anything else.
Affected characters will face risks equivalent to a serious task (Exalted, p. 216) to approach or claim the Abyssal’s creation, but won’t take actions that would obviously physically harm them. If no safe path exists, they’ll stop and observe from where they are. In combat, they must use their movement action each turn to approach it.
This costs three [[Willpower]] to resist, separate from resisting Magnificent Cenotaph Allure’s influence.
This effect fades immediately when [[Magnificent Cenotaph Allure]] ends. The Abyssal can only enhance a single use of that Charm with [[Drawn to Death’s Beauty]] at a time.
