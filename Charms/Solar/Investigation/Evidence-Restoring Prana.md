*The Lawgiver is preternaturally aware of the connections between objects.*
She is so keenly aware of these connections that she can sense when the flow has been disturbed. This sensation comes across as a momentary visualization of [[Essence]] flows, fixating on the remains of evidence that’s been destroyed, which the Lawgiver perceives as a well of negative energies, a disruption in the flow of [[Essence]]. She may then pay six motes to touch this well, momentarily restoring the flow of [[Essence]] to glimpse the evidence in its complete state. This Charm can momentarily restore evidence no larger than that which the Exalt can normally lift and carry, but it allows her a full examination of the destroyed object. Once her examination of the restored object has concluded, her commitment is dropped and the [[Essence]] of the object disperses.
