The Sidereal whispers a question into the earth as she buries a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of That Old Thing, knowing that the world will provide her answer once this strange seed is fully grown. The Sidereal’s buried prayer strip grows into a tall mulberry tree over the course of the next five days. Upon returning to it, she rolls (Charisma + Investigation). She need not wait for the tree to complete its growth to return, but she subtracts one successes for each day early she returns. For each success, she discovers some useful gift left by local spirits drawn to the tree. By default, these are clues relevant to the Sidereal’s question or a larger investigation; if she rolls more successes than there are relevant clues for the Storyteller to share, these gifts might instead be valuable treasures, items she’s misplaced, clues unrelated to her investigation that have some other relevance to her, or other useful offerings. These are accompanied by worthless gifts of twigs, leaves, and interesting stones left by minor spirits.
