Their spirits conjoined, mount and rider streak toward their target with a powerful Essence-infused leap. This Charm allows a Solar using the prerequisite to attempt a rush action on an aerial opponent or target (such as a Haslanti skyship) at any range. If successful, the result is identical to a successful rush; if the target is moving away, the Exalt follows an additional range band. If the Solar pursues a target for more than two turns using the prerequisite, drop the Willpower cost from this Charm.
