*Hinting at grim possibilities, the Guise’s master sows delusions of infection as insidious as any disease.*
The wearer convinces her victim that he suffers from a mundane disease, making a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Medicine]]) instill roll against a single character as she describes the disease’s.
If successful, the victim believes he’s infected with the disease. He gains a Minor Obsession (Exalted, p.
168) embodying this belief, experiencing psychosomatic or hallucinatory symptoms, and must immediately make a [[Willpower]] roll against it.
Because this isn’t a real disease, the victim doesn’t receive ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) rolls against this “disease.” [[Medicine]] rolls and magic that heals disease are likewise inapplicable. However, he appears infected to diagnosis rolls unless they succeed with three extra successes. Additionally, the wearer may treat is as a disease for any magic she uses against him if it’s advantageous to her, other than healing.
If the wearer prescribes a treatment with [[Snakeskin Wine Scheme]], the victim’s Obsession also extends to following her instructions. The wearer may choose to make these treatments efficacious, removing the Obsession if her victim follows her instructions. Doing so causes him to gain a Tie of trust to her with an intensity one step higher than usual.
## Resonant
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, subsequent uses of this Evocation can be used to strengthen the Obsession. The wearer must leverage one of her victim’s other Intimacies to support this, as usual (Exalted, 215).
## Reset 
This Evocation can’t be used against the same character more than once per session.
