*The Lunar fosters perfect understanding among comrades, wordlessly communicating with sign language, expressive dance-like motions, or pheromones.*
She and any number of willing characters within long range can communicate amongst themselves as per [[Glance-Oration Technique]]. This transcends language barriers, but characters unfamiliar with each other may suffer penalties on initial communication until they’ve grown accustomed. The Lunar may reflexively add or remove characters from this group. Outsiders can only detect the communication if they’re specifically watching for it or have superhuman or magically enhanced senses, rolling ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against the [[Guile]] of a character communicating in this way. Success lets them notice the communication, but not understand it. If the Lunar includes her Solar mate in the communication, they have the option of speaking directly to each other’s souls, enabling the communication of complex ideas and extending the range of communication to ([[Essence]] x10 miles), which other characters can’t detect. 
## Totemic
Lunars with hive-dwelling spirit shapes may learn this as a [[Charisma]] Charm, with [[Guiding the Flock]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
