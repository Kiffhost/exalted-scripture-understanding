The Solar represents a new dawn on the last day of Creation. Her coming foretells the battle’s end, a day of blood for the wicked and light to vanquish darkness from the world once more. When her army is routed, the Lawgiver may call upon glories past—in this life and those that came before—to create a rallying tactic that miraculously reforms her army. This Charm is an automatically successful rally action (p. 210). It can be used once per scene, but it can be reset if the Solar succeeds at vanquishing a terrible foe or conquering a powerful enemy through the might of her army.
