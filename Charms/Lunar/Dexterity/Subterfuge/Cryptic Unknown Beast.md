*Others glimpse the Lunar for only a heartbeat before she vanishes, leaving them doubting their own eyes.*
After other characters have made [[Awareness]] rolls opposing her [[Stealth]], she forces them to reroll all dice that show successes. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with an unexpected attack and then establishing concealment against all enemies. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with [[Ambush]] Hunter, if the Lunar establishes concealment against all enemies while in combat, she rolls [[Join Battle]].
