The Hungering Fangs are stained with the blood and power of countless beasts, letting their wielder draw on the puissance of her slain prey.
When the wielder uses Lessons of the Hunt, she may gain up to (Essence) of that character’s Eclipse Charms, or any other Charms or spells he knows whose prerequisites she meets. (She can’t learn other types of Exalted Charms.) She can still gain specialties and mutations from Lessons of the Hunt as usual. These powers can only be used while wielding the blades.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, if the defeated enemy knew an Evocation that could be used with short daiklaves, the wielder can gain that Evocation this way if she meets its prerequisites, though she can only use it with the blades.
The wielder may permanently learn Charms, Evocations, or spells accessed this way for their normal cost, paying eight experience for Eclipse Charms. She waives the experience point cost of the first such power she purchases this way.
A Lunar who uses Stolen Power Bezoar (p. 64) together with this Evocation may choose to manifest its hearthstone within the Hungering Fangs instead of herself.
This doesn’t use one of their hearthstone sockets — the hearthstone rises out of the moonsilver surface of one of the blades.
## Resonant
The wielder can also gain native Charms of her Exalt type that relate to how she bested her quarry or that resemble her prowess. She must still meet their prerequisites, as above.
