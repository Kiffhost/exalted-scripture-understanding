Embodying the perfect predator, the Lunar’s scent awakens deep-seated prey instincts and panic responses. Anyone that can see or smell her suffers −1 Resolve against her threaten rolls, and against fear-based Charms that compare her Appearance to his Resolve. Affected characters also suffer a −(Lunar’s Appearance – his Resolve) penalty, minimum −1, on rolls to attack or speak against the Lunar. A character may resist this Charm for a scene for one Willpower and (Lunar’s Appearance – his Resolve) Initiative, minimum one. Protean: In predatory animal shapes, this Charm can be used reflexively upon winning Join Battle.
