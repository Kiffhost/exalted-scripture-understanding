The [[Solar Exalted]] are paragons of mythic heroism, with reputations earned by completing impossible feats. Through [[Divine Mantle]], the Lawgiver can further embody the Principles most central to her character by temporarily learning the [[Charms]] of spirits that represent the Principles the Solar has embodied. However, the Exalt may only take [[Charms]] from spirits whose nature match one of her Defining Principles, and may only take one spirit Charm for every six Solar Ability [[Charms]] she knows which match both the spirit’s nature and the Defining Principle in question. Thus, the more strongly she embodies a certain Principle, the more [[Charms]] she can take from the god in question. The Storyteller can pick from published spirits or can make up appropriate [[Charms]] on the spot for the purposes of this Charm. The Exalt may take up the [[Charms]] of multiple different spirits simultaneously, but she may have no more than ten spirit [[Charms]] through [[Divine Mantle]]. However, if the grounding Principle is lowered in intensity or destroyed, or if any being successfully impugns her embodiment of said Principle by usurping her authority, defeating her, or destroying or harming the subject of her Principle, then she loses her ability to perform the greater miracles of the spirit’s office until she has taken actions to undo the harm or restore her damaged Principle. If the Solar wishes to change which spirit [[Charms]] she is using, she must spend one hour per Charm meditating on the target Principle. This allows her to move up or down the spirit’s Charm trees as needed. She can also swap ([[Essence]] or three, whichever is greater) [[Charms]] through one use of [[Mind-Cleansing Prana]]. Adding the [[Charms]] of a new spirit to her repertoire requires a new activation of the Charm.
