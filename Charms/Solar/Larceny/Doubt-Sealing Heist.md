Upon successfully robbing a person of something they own, the Exalt may attempt to unwind the owner’s memory of attachment to the item. The player rolls a (Manipulation + Larceny) instill action against the target’s Resolve. On a success, the Lawgiver convinces the target that the object belongs to her (and always has). The target may not pay Willpower to shake off this belief until (Solar’s Essence) minutes have passed.
