*The Infernal knows her nemesis’ every fault and flaw as intimately as her own, the perfect inversion of his imperfections.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must be using [[Nemesis Self Imagined Anew]]. She makes an influence roll with any Ability that targets only her nemesis, adding a free full Excellency. If one of the antagonistic Intimacies that the Infernal’s formed with [[Nemesis Self Imagined Anew]] supports her influence, her nemesis counts as having that Intimacy for her influence — and his own corresponding Intimacy is suppressed for that influence. The Willpower cost to resist increases to (Infernal’s Intimacy).
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by causing the Infernal’s nemesis to suffer a significant setback — defeat in battle, the collapse of a major project, divorce, etc. She doesn’t need to have [[Nemesis Self Imagined Anew]] active when she does so.
