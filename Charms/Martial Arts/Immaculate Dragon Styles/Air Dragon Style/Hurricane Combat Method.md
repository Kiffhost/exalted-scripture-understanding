*Honing her speed and reflexes beyond their utmost, the Immaculate unleashes the hurricane.*
Upon entering [[Air Dragon Form]], she may pay six motes and one [[Willpower]] to enhance it. Its [[Defense|Evasion]] bonus increases to +2, and she doubles 9s on [[Stealth]] and movement rolls. Once per round, she may pay five [[Initiative]] to reflexively make a withering or decisive attack that doesn’t count as her attack for the round, and can be used to clash attacks against her.
