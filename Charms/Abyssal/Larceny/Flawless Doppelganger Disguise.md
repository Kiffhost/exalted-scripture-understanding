*The Abyssal is a thief of faces, concealing her dark nature behind another’s visage.*
The Abyssal can use [[False Heart Mien]] for five motes, one [[Willpower]] to add an additional ([[Essence]]) nonCharm successes on the disguise roll and waive the penalty for impersonating specific characters or altering her body type beyond that Charm’s normal limits.
Even characters using magic can’t roll to contest the deathknight’s disguise unless she acts grossly out of character, and they suffer an additional −4 penalty. This increases to −5 if they have previously failed a roll against that disguise.
Additionally, the Abyssal’s disguise can alter the appearance of her anima banner and Caste Mark to imitate other types of Exalt and manifest supernatural sensory displays, such as the lightning that crackles around a storm god or the eerie chill that attends the presence of a dread specter.
