*Flesh twists and roils under the Abyssal physician’s ministrations, postponing the promise of inevitable decay.*
The Abyssal rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) with double 9s to treat a patient’s wounds. This requires at least fifteen minutes of treatment. As long as a patient remains in convalescence for the rest of the day, he heals levels of non-aggravated damage equal to the Abyssal’s successes. No convalescence is necessary for the undead.
The Abyssal can also use this Charm to repair reanimated corpses. She waives its [[Willpower]] cost when she does, and no convalescence is necessary.
