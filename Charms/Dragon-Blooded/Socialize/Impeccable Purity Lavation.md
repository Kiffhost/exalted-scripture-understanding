Submersing herself in cleansing waters, the Dragon-Blood washes away all imperfections. After spending at least an hour bathing, she emerges resplendent and pure. Her cleanliness transcends the world; she cannot be stained or dirtied by any mundane material. Any character that interacts with her is treated as having a positive Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her, with an emotional context chosen by that character’s player. A fellow Dynast might respect her faultless grooming and manners; a peasant might be awestruck by her impossible purity; an assassin sent to kill her might fall in love as he smells the perfume she bathed in. Characters who already have a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] for the Dragon-Blood instead suffer –1 [[Resolve]] against her. A character can spend one [[Willpower]] to become immune for this Charm’s duration; if the Dragon-Blood treats someone offensively or demandingly, no [[Willpower]] is necessary to resist.
With [[Essence]] 3, the Dragon-Blood reduces the costs of [[Auspicious First Meeting Attitude]], [[Enticing Paramour Passion]], [[Heart-Conquering Prowess]], [[Hot-Blooded Ardor]], [[Vivacious Dragon Beauty]], and [[Warm-Faced Seduction Style]] by one mote each.
