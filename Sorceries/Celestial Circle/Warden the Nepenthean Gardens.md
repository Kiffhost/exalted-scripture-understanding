*In the waning days of the Divine Revolution, war-weary ancients took to wrecking a Creation they thought they might soon lose, and thus were the wardens of the nepenthean gardens exiled beyond reality to a realm of smoke and loneliness. Through will and work, a sorcerer may loosen this exile, drawing a warden back into Creation to resume its benevolent work.*
These gentle beings speak no language but understand all, even the calls of animals. While they gain a Major Tie of loyalty and gratitude toward their summoner, they offer their healing gifts freely whenever safe to do so, even to the sorcerer’s foes.
## Control
The spell’s duration extends to one day. Once per story, the sorcerer may permanently release one of the wardens from their exile; while forever grateful, they never remain in her retinue for more than a story, instead venturing into the world to continue their healing work.
## Distortion
(20)
The sorcerer wracks a warden within medium range with visions of the prison-realm to which they will soon return, inflicting a (sorcerer’s Essence) penalty on their actions and removing the effects of Inviolate Purpose.
WARDEN OF THE NEPENTHEAN GARDENS A warden of the nepenthean gardens is a pearlescent, many-armed being standing roughly 10 feet tall; their wrinkled flesh overflows with bountiful patches of healing fungi. Essence: 5; Willpower: 7; Join Battle: 5 dice Personal: 100 Health Levels: −0×4/−1×6/−2×6/−4×6/Incap. Actions: Comforting Influence: 12 dice; Feats of Strength: 9 dice (can attempt Strength 5 feats); Medicine: 14 dice; Read Intentions: 12 dice Appearance 1, Resolve 5, Guile 1 COMBAT Attack (Unarmed): 7 dice (Damage 10B) Attack (Grapple): 10 dice (10 dice to control) Combat Movement: 4 dice Evasion: 1; Parry: 3 Soak/Hardness: 12/5 INTIMACIES Defining Principle: All living beings deserve my gifts. Defining Tie: The wounded and ill (Devotion) Major Tie: The sorcerer (Gratitude) MERITS Inviolate Purpose: The warden treats any influence that would prevent them from attending to those in need of healing as unacceptable. DEFENSIVE CHARMS Who Strikes the Innocent? (5m; Reflexive; Instant): An attack against the warden removes one success for each 1 or 2 rolled. SOCIAL CHARMS A Plea for All Life (15m, 1wp; Supplemental; Instant): The warden releases a wordless, bone-vibrating plea, doubling 8s on a persuade roll to halt hostilities. This waives penalties for targeting multiple characters and can be understood without a shared language. Characters must spend an extra point of Willpower to resist in a Decision Point. Once per scene. MISCELLANEOUS CHARMS Pain Finds No Purchase (7m; Reflexive; One scene): Characters within short range reduce their total penalties from wounds, illness, and disease by 5. The warden may reflexively spend one Willpower to extend this to medium range until the start of their next turn. Merciful Resurgence (10m, 1wp; Simple; Instant): Allies within short range roll (their current wound penalty) dice, healing one level of non-aggravated damage for each success. The warden can reactivate this Charm on their next turn, paying a cumulative 10-mote surcharge — 20 motes for the second use, 30 for the third, etc. Characters who have intentionally maimed or killed in the scene cannot benefit from this Charm. Once per scene continued use on consecutive turns doesn’t count. Gentle Ministration (15m; Simple; One day): One resting character under the warden’s care doesn’t suffer damage or ill effects from ongoing poison or disease. Bountiful Pharmacy Flesh (4m; Simple; Instant): The warden metabolizes a remedy from their body’s fungi, removing the need for equipment when treating mundane afflictions.
