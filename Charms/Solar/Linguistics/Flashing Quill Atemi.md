The Lawgiver strikes a body of text with her fingers, reshaping the language to serve her purposes. With this Charm, the Solar may edit a manuscript, letter, or tome with untraceable precision. Where she draws her fingertips through lines, words lift from pages as if they were never written. Where she draws her fingertips through runes, ink chases itself into the shapes of new words. Through use of this Charm, the Solar can change the targets of written social influence, and can redefine what is intended by any social influence she encounters. Modifying a work encrypted with magic allows her to redirect the targets of that magic. If she wishes to alter magic she is incapable of producing, she must possess Essence 5+ and must use Power-Snaring Image in combination with this Charm. This combination explicitly allows her to alter magic for which she does not meet minimums.
