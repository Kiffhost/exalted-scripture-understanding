*As the Lunar directs the flow of battle, her arrayed forces create an opening for her allies to seize victory.*
When a battle group that benefits from her order action crashes an enemy or reduces an enemy battle group’s [[Size]], she may transfer the [[Initiative]] Break to an ally within medium range of her. If the [[Initiative]] Break came from attacking a battle group, she may pay a three-[[Initiative]] surcharge to grant that ally (damaged group’s previous [[Size]] x2) additional [[Initiative]]. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm.
