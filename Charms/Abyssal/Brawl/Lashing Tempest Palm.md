*The Abyssalâ€™s blow unleashes a maelstrom of spiritual pressure, sending her victim flying.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after making a decisive damage roll. As long as she rolls at least one success, her enemy is knocked prone and loses one [[Initiative]], which she gains after resetting to base. With more successes, she can strike with even greater force:
 - With 3+ success, she can knock her victim into an object or surface within close range to inflict damage per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232), destroying flimsy objects like thin wooden walls.
 - With 4+ successes, she can strike him into an object or surface at close range with enough force to inflict damage per a medium-range fall and leave cracks in thick stone walls, or knock him to short range, inflicting damage per a short-range fall.
 - With 5+ successes, she can knock an enemy to short range and inflict damage per a mediumrange fall.
With [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal doubles her successes on the damage roll for the purpose of determining how far she can fling her enemies. With 7+ successes, she can knock an enemy out to medium range and inflict damage per a medium-range fall.
