The Exalt conquers her foe’s senses, leaving only his eyes to settle the contest. The Solar enacts a technique allowing her to defeat one sense, rendering her undetectable to it. She can defeat the senses of hearing, smell, touch, and taste. However, she cannot use this Charm to overcome a target’s sight. If she uses her sound-banishing technique, she is completely silent; not even the heightened sensory acuity of a guard dog’s ears can detect her. Likewise, if she banishes touch, then someone who bumps into her in a pitch black room will be completely unaware. If she banishes taste, then the probing taste organs of an octopus or the flicking of a great serpent’s tongue will not find her. This Charm may be stacked twice, allowing the Solar to banish up to two senses. If the player stunts the Charm description in such a way that it explains the nature of sensory muting as an extension of her skills, the cost of the Charm is reduced by two motes.
