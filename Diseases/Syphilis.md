Syphilis is a venereal disease, spread through sexual contact with the infected. Symptoms begin with a painless genital lesion, but progress over weeks into rash, fever, malaise, weight loss, or any other of a host of possible symptoms. Chronic patients may develop dementia or seizures as the syphilis spreads to their brain after years of infection.
