Who can gainsay a prince to whom even the lion bows? When the Lunar makes an instill roll to give others a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward someone with whom she has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]], she adds ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm successes. Affected characters treat any negative Ties toward the designated character as one step lower in intensity for the scene. If the Lunar uses this Charm to benefit her Solar mate, affected characters must enter a Decision Point and invoke an [[Intimacy]] equal to or greater in intensity than her [[Intimacy|Tie]] to him in order to resist.
