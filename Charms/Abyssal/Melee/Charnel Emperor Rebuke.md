*Those with the temerity to strike the deathknight are quickly relieved of their foolish hopes of survival.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm to make a withering counterattack after an attack roll beats her Parry, but before the damage roll. She doesn’t gain any [[Initiative]] from the counterattack’s damage roll, but instead rolls that many dice of decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]].
