The Sidereal enters a stance she was never taught, adapting to her enemiesâ€™ numbers, her tactical disadvantages, and the soil of the battlefield beneath her feet. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  An enemy hit by her attack subtracts his onslaught penalty from his effective Initiative to determine when he acts until his onslaught refreshes. 
-  She can flurry aiming with a full defense, ignoring the Defense penalty for doing so. 
-  A successful disarm or distract gambit also rolls dice of decisive damage equal to the 10s on the Initiative roll, ignoring Hardness. 
-  She can make gambits against enemies at medium range or further without needing to aim. 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal can enter this Form reflexively when she hits with a decisive attack that benefits from aiming.
