*The Exalt remembers past lives and past failures, and knows that her death is the death of the world.* 
Once per scene, the Exalt may pay two [[Initiative]] when struck with a decisive attack, instantly regaining a point of temporary [[Willpower]].
This Charm is reset by surviving a decisive attack of 10+ raw damage without taking a single health level of damage.
