*The Lunar becomes a rippling dark mirror that reflects the deepest fears of those who gaze into it.*
She makes an ([[Appearance]] + [[Presence]]) threaten roll against one character, instinctively shifting through many frightening forms that ensure her influence aligns with the target’s strongest fear-based [[Intimacy|Tie]]. She needn’t be aware of this [[Intimacy]], nor does she learn what it is. This Charm can target fears other than a person or animal — e.g., a Dynast whose greatest fear is poverty might see the Lunar as a Ragara banker come to collect. If the Lunar’s target lacks !!fear-basedTies,sherecoupsthisCharm’sWillpowercost.!! If the Lunar is using [[Shifting Penumbra Stance]] (p. XX), she may target multiple characters with this Charm. Each sees his greatest fear in her unknowable semblance. Protean: If the Lunar is already in a shape that is her victim’s greatest fear, the cost of resisting increases by one [[Willpower]].
