*The deathknight’s calm and restraint conceal a roiling core of rage, ceaselessly gnawing at its fetters as it strains to break free.*
The Abyssal abandons all restraint, entering a berserk fury:
 - She adds dice equal to her wound penalty to the post-soak damage of withering attacks and the damage of decisive attacks, maximum ([[Strength]]).
 - She treats any Intimacies relevant to her motivation for fighting as one step stronger. Those that are already Defining instead provide a +5 [[Resolve]] bonus or −4 [[Resolve]] penalty.
 - She suffers −1 [[Defense]], which can’t be negated.
 - She can’t withdraw, use social influence for purposes unrelated to combat, or cease fighting until all enemies are incapacitated or have fled. She’s still capable of tactical thinking and intelligent decision.
Ending this Charm prematurely crashes the Abyssal, setting her to [[Initiative]] –3 (if not already lower).
