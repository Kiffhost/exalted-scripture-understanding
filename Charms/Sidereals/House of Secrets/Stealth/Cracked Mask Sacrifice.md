The Sidereal is struck by a fatal blow, but it is not her who dies — only someone who never was. When the Sidereal takes a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201), she may sacrifice a resplendent destiny instead of suffering maiming. If she has one active, she must sacrifice it; otherwise, she can expend any of her resplendent destinies. This negates ([[Essence]], maximum 5) levels of damage. The sundered resplendent destiny is cast off as a corpse of appropriate appearance, though it unravels into gossamer threads under physical examination. Observer’s memories of the corpse and its strange nature are subject to arcane fate.
