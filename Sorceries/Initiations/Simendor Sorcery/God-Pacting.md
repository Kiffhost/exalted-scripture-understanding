*The sorcerer may bargain with spirits for portions of their power.*
Once per day, the sorcerer may strike a pact with a willing spirit. Its player proposes an [[Intimacy]] for the sorcerer to gain. If the sorcerer's player accepts, the sorcerer gains that [[Intimacy]] at Minor intensity and (spirit's [[Essence]] + 3) sorcerous motes, which last for the rest of the day. The contracting spirit loses that many motes.
