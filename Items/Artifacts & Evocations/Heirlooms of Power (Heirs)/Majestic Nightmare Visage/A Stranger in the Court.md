The courts of chaos are blind to what lies behind [[Majestic Nightmare Visage]]. While the wearer is disguised as the Childe, fae automatically fail any rolls opposing her disguise or rolls against her [[Guile]] that would contradict the disguise unless their efforts are enhanced by magic.
Even if it’s enhanced by magic, 1s and 2s subtract successes.
If a Dragon-Blood uses [[Terrifying Forest-Devil Mask]] to disguise herself as the Childe, she’s immune to exposure to the Wyld for that Charm’s duration.

## Special activation rules
A Dragon-Blooded scion of the [[Cult]] of the Violet Fang awakens this Evocation at no cost upon disguising herself as the Childe.
