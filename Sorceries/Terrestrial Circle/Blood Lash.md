The sorcerer scourges her spirit with a masochistic invocation, forcing blood from her open wounds to coalesce into a scarlet whip tipped with black barbs. The whip has [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Generic Artifact Weapons/Direlash]] traits (ACC +5, DMG +10, DEF +0, OVW 3; Tags: Lethal, Melee, Natural, Disarming, Grappling, Flexible, Reaching). She halves wound penalties, rounded down, when attacking, grappling, or parrying with it. This spell’s health-level cost is waived if the sorcerer has any non-bashing damage in her health track. The lash gains additional powers as the sorcerer’s wound penalty rises: 
-  −1: Whipped Dog Infliction (3m; Reflexive; Instant): After damaging an enemy, the sorcerer reflexively rolls a threaten action against him. Wound penalties don’t apply to it; they’re instead converted to bonus dice. 
-  −2: Endless Crimson Coils (5m; Supplemental; Instant; Uniform): The lash extends to attack out to short range. If the sorcerer grapples an enemy at range, she may pull him to close range or leave him where she is. If she chooses the latter, an ally can free the grappled character from the clinch with a difficulty 3 gambit. 
-  −4: Bloodthirsty Scarlet Serpent (5m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; Decisive-only): The sorcerer makes a decisive attack as the blood lash grows a terrible fanged maw, draining her victim’s vitality. She heals a level of non-aggravated damage for every 3 levels of damage dealt to a living nontrivial enemy, minimum 1. Waive Endless Crimson Coils’ and Whipped Dog Infliction’s costs. This power can only be used once per scene, unless reset by taking 7+ levels of decisive damage. 
A sorcerer with this as her control spell is covered with dark, prominent veins. She can control any blood she sheds until it dries, causing it to move as she wills. Using the blood to assist in actions provides exceptional equipment bonuses (Exalted, p. 580). The blood can rarely attempt rolls by itself, but if the Storyteller deems it possible, the sorcerer rolls normally. This power has no range limit, but the sorcerer’s senses aren’t extended through her blood.

(Goal Number: 10)
The blood lash congeals, inflicting bashing damage instead of lethal, and losing the Flexible tag. The sorcerer’s wound penalty is treated as one lower for purposes of the lash’s powers.
