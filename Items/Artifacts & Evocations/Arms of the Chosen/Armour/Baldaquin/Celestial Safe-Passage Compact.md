*Baldaquin recalls how the Eight Directions Embassy forged pacts between the Crowned Suns and the spirit courts, allowing its wearer to forge similar pacts between any two of Creation’s rulers or governments.*
Once both rulers or their rightful representatives agree to the pact, envoys and their entourages traveling on official business from one ruler’s court to the other’s gain the benefits of diplomatic immunity provided by the [[Eclipse]] Caste anima power (Exalted, p. 177). The pact persists through succession, usurpation, or even civil war so long as continuity of government remains. Once either ruler or ruling body officially forswears the pact, or either government ceases to exist in its current form, future envoys lose the pact’s protection, but envoys currently on official business retain its protection for the duration of their embassy. This Evocation can be used once per story. If the wearer is an [[Eclipse]] Caste Solar, she can reset it by completing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) in her role as intermediary.
