*The Infernal’s bloodlust and rage consumes her, quickening her movements into blurs of ultraviolence.*

The Infernal makes (Strength/2, rounded up) decisive attacks against a single enemy. She divides her Initiative evenly among them to determine their damage, rounded up. She adds an additional die of damage against enemies who are prone, grappled by the Infernal, or mortals.

Once these attacks are completed, if the Infernal’s target is prone, she makes two additional attacks, which are undodgeable. Their damage equals the number of attacks in the initial barrage that hit, ignoring Hardness.
## [[Keys]]
#### Excessive Slaughter Overkill (Essence 3)
The Infernal makes an additional attack both in the initial barrage and in the flurry of undodgeable attacks against a prone enemy.
