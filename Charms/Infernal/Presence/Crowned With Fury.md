*A crown of green flame lights the Infernal’s brow as she proclaims the rightful order of the cosmos.*

The Infernal’s emerald corona grants the following benefits when she makes a spoken persuade or threaten roll using any Ability to issue an order or make a demand, or any other influence the Storyteller deems suitable:
- She adds (Presence/2, rounded up) dice.
- Characters with Ties toward the Infernal based on fear, terrified awe, obedience, loyalty, or similar contexts apply those Intimacies’ penalties to their Resolve when determining the bonus dice added by the Infernal’s Appearance.
- Characters who have such Ties at Defining intensity must pay an additional Willpower to resist. This doesn’t apply to characters with Essence higher than the Infernal’s own.

The Infernal can’t conceal her emerald crown, which shines like a glowing anima (p XX).
## [[Keys]]
#### Fury-Forged Submission (Presence 4)
The Infernal gains this Charm’s benefits on rolls to instill Ties to herself that are based on fear, terrified awe, obedience, loyalty, or similar contexts. It also benefits rolls to weaken Ties to the Infernal that would oppose her commands.
#### Eternal Terror Reign (Presence 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal gains this Charm’s benefits permanently. Her crown blazes whenever she makes an influence roll it can enhance. This isn’t optional.
#### Cosmic Tyrant Decree (Presence 5, Essence 3) (1wp)
The influence roll’s Willpower cost is increased for characters with Major Ties as well as Defining ones. The Infernal can pay one Willpower after a successful influence roll to increase the cost to resist by one for all characters, in addition to any cost increase from Ties. If her influence has multiple targets, she must pay this key’s cost separately for each of them.
