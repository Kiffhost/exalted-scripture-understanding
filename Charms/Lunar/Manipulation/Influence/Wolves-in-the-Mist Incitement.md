*The Lunar’s predatory [[Essence]] suffuses her voice and mannerisms, awakening primal fears that sleep in the caverns of the soul.*
She makes a ([[Manipulation]] + {Presence or Socialize}) inspire roll to create fear. This doesn’t require her to directly address her targets, though she must speak in a language they understand or employ body language. This Charm’s victims won’t perceive the Lunar as the source of their fear. Affected characters believe they’re in imminent danger from an unknown threat. In addition to an inspire action’s normal effects, for the rest of the scene they suffer −1 [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]], and a −2 penalty on actions that don’t help safeguard against the danger. This increases to −3 on [[Join Battle]] rolls and [[Awareness]] rolls to detect enemies — the victims are too preoccupied with the nonexistent threat to see the real danger. Once a character has Joined Battle, these penalties no longer apply to him (although the inspired fear remains).
