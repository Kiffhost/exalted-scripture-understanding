*The Immaculate’s fluid posture and footwork defies all restraint.*
She doubles 9s on a (Strength+Martial Arts) roll to resist a grapple, a disengage roll, a roll opposing an enemy’s rush, or any roll to escape from restraints such as manacles. 
In Water Aura, success on the roll grants one [[Initiative]].
