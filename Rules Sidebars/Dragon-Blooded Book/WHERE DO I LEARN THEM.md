The vast majority of Dragon-Blooded Immaculates train in the Cloister of Wisdom (p. 86), but it’s not the only source of tutelage. Immaculate monks occasionally mentor lay Dragon-Blooded who hold the Order’s favor. Beyond the Realm, Lookshy’s Immaculate Faith and Prasad’s Pure Way provide instruction in the styles, as do the [[Sidereal Exalted]]. Renegade ex-Immaculates teach in heretical dojos, while lost scrolls and training manuals of the Shogunate offer instruction to whoever finds them.
