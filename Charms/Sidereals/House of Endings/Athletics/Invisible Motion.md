*With a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and the Dust wrapped around her forehead or neck, smelling faintly of lilacs and decay, the Sidereal skips past unnecessary seconds, reducing her actions to instantaneousness.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits
- She waives the cost of Inexorable Advance, Distance-Severing Stride, and Step-Silencing Exercise.
- She waives Shattered Stepping-Stone Advance’s Willpower cost.
- She can cross even the harshest terrain with incredible speed. A journey that would normally take her a week traveling on foot can be completed in a day, a day’s journey in a few hours, and an hour’s journey in 10 minutes. She’s never impeded by terrain in determining how long a journey will take, flickering from point to point as she traverses the harshest of landscapes.
- When she flurries, she can take three actions instead of two, as long as at least two of the flurried actions use physical Attributes. This is compatible with Abilities other than Athletics. The Sidereal ignores the Defense penalty for flurrying and can flurry Stealth rolls to establish concealment.
- Freed from unnecessary motion, physical exertion doesn’t tire her. She can complete a night’s sleep in a single hour and can run while asleep.
