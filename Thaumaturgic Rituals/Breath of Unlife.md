# Breath of Unlife
With an eight hour ritual requiring a minor [[sacrifice]] (p. XX), animate an undead servant bound with a Major Tie of loyalty. Each ritual creates a specific kind of servitor â€” zombies (Exalted, p. 502) are the most common; variations grant between two and four dots of Innate Merits or Mutations. Rituals are highly specific, often requiring either a certain time, place, or rare material.
