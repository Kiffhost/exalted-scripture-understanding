A few choice words are all it takes to turn any soiree or party into a firestorm of argument and recriminations. The Dragon-Blood rolls to inspire one or more characters with anger, ignoring the penalty for targeting multiple characters. Affected characters must express their outrage towards the Dragon-Blood using social influence in a way chosen by their player â€”engaging the Dragon-Blood in an argument, bad-mouthing her to his associates, or some similar social expression of outrage. If that character already intended to commit violence against her, he may do so, but must express his rage through word and deed simultaneously.
