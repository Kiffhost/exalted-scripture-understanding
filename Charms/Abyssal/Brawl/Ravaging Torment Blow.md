*The Abyssal preys on her maimed foe’s weakness, striking at already-broken bones and digging her fingers into open wounds.*
The Abyssal adds dice equal to her target’s wound penalty on the raw damage of a withering or decisive attack.
If his wound penalty has been increased above its base value, only (Essence) extra points count toward this.
While using Dark Messiah’s Wrath, (higher of Essence or Strength), points of extra wound penalties count toward the Abyssal’s damage.
