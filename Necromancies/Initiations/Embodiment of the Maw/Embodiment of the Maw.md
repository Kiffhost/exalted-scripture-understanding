*In the nightmares of the ever-dying [[Neverborn]], something hungers.*
Known to specters by many names — the Hunger of the Void, the All-Devourer, the Grand Maw — it exists within the periphery of their minds, a parasitic existence that offers power to those who nurture it within themselves. Once embodied, this nameless voracity will become the perfect principle of consumption, able to devour even the Neverborn and grant them their final ending. Devotees channel this nascent principle, cultivating it internally through ritual consumption of specters, austerities performed in the [[Labyrinth]], and lucid night terrors. Its influence grows among nephwrack adherents who evangelize the coming of the All-Devourer in holy wars with their specter brethren. The esoteric shadowlands cult of Saturn-in-Starvation worships the Maw as an avatar of the Maiden of Endings, praying for an end to the raids orchestrated by their [[Labyrinth]]-twisted ancestors from the catacombs beneath their land.
