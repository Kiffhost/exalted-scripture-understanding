*The Abyssal has fettered her soul and found eternal life, rising again and again from certain death so long as there is hatred still left in her heart.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she’s incapacitated or would suffer death for any reason, surviving it by calling on a Defining [[Intimacy]] protected by [[Eternal Enmity Approach]]. She seems to die, yet endures in a torpor that’s indistinguishable from death by anything less than [[Eye of the Unconquered Sun]].
Come the next sunset, the Abyssal rises, with all damage and crippling injuries healed no matter how severe they were. She may drag herself out of a grave, well, or the ashes of a pyre where hopefuls burned her corpse. The only way her foes can kill her is to wait for her to rise, then try again. She can invoke [[World-Ending Void Apostle]] when she rises, and can use it with [[Charms]] to aid in escaping imprisonment.
In exchange for the Abyssal’s survival, the chosen [[Intimacy]] loses Eternal Enmity Approach’s protection for the rest of the story.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses Sworn to Endless Vengeance together with this Charm to swear vengeance on the enemy responsible for her “death,” she waives its [[Willpower]] cost. If she successfully takes her revenge, she restores Eternal Enmity Approach’s protection to the chosen [[Intimacy]].
