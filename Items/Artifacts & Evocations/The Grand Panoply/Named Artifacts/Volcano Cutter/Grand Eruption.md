*Its red blade livid with burning power, the Solar drives the !!pointofVolcanoCutterintothegroundandforcesamassive!! pulse of elemental [[Essence]] through the earth, provoking a !!fieryeruptionbeneathheropponent’sfeet.GrandEruption!! is an unblockable withering or decisive attack which can strike a single target at out to medium range.*
Any opponent !!struckbyGrandEruptionisknockedprone.GrandEruption!! can only be used if the Solar and her target both stand upon the earth or at least a building’s first floor—it can’t be used !!onthesecondstoryofapalace,thedeckofaHaslantiairboat,!! or the back of a rampaging Behemoth. Where [[Grand Eruption]] strikes, it leaves behind a field of steaming, burning, volatile ground encompassing one whole range band—an eruption point, which lasts for the rest of the scene. Eruption points build [[Initiative]] as the Solar continues to fight. Each time the Solar makes a successful withering attack with [[Volcano Cutter]], roll (the Solar’s [[Essence]] + 5) dice and add the resulting successes to all eruption points’ [[Initiative]] value. An eruption point can hold no more than 25 [[Initiative]] at once. Anyone who enters an eruption point that holds 5 or more [[Initiative]] immediately takes the full current [[Initiative]] value of the eruption point as decisive lethal damage, as the roiling geomantic [[Essence]] detonates in a massive pillar of flame, resetting the eruption point to a base of 3 [[Initiative]]. Eruption points burn incidental scenery above them (furniture, saplings, and the like) without detonating, and may detonate to damage tactically important scenery like walls and cover-providing trees if placed under them with [[Evocations]] such as [[Caldera Reconfiguration Stance]]. 

## Special activation rules

Each time the Solar makes an attack with [[Volcano Cutter]], she gains one mote for each 10 in her roll, and 2 motes for each set of 7, 8, 9, and 10. These motes are stored outside of her [[Essence]] pool, in [[Volcano Cutter]] itself. No more than 10 such motes can be held at once. They can be used only to trigger [[Grand Eruption]], and [[Grand Eruption]] can only be paid for with these special motes.
