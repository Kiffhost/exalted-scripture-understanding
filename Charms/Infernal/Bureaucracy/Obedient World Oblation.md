*All things heed the Green Sun Prince’s authority, though some delude themselves otherwise. They need only be reminded of what they already know.*

When the Infernal makes an influence roll that leverages a Tie of reverence toward her or a Principle based on belief in the laws of Hell, she treats its intensity as one step higher for determining what she can convince him to do (Exalted, p. 216). If it’s a Defining Intimacy, the Willpower cost to resist her influence is increased by one.
