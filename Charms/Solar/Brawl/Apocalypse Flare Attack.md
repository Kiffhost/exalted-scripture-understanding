The Lawgiver reaches deep into her [[Essence]], drawing forth a mountain-crushing surge of spirit pressure that burns like a small sun between her hands. The Solar then hurls this flare of burning [[Essence]] like a comet to strike a foe she can perceive at any range. The base damage for this attack is any damage the Solar has gathered with [[Fire-Eating Fist]]. In addition, the Exalt may choose to pour three levels of anima banner into the attack, shedding them to give the attack three automatic successes and ([[Essence]]) additional damage. This attack does not include the Exaltâ€™s [[Initiative]] and does not return her to base value.
