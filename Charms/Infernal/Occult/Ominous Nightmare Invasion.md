*The Infernal dances through dreams with a grace that delights Hegra and Oramus both. How wonderful their Green Sun Princes are!*

The Infernal touches a sleeping character and rolls ({Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation} + Occult]) against his Guile. He suffers the −2 Guile penalty for being unaware of her. If successful, the Infernal enters into his dreams, watching them as a formless frisson of subtle dread. Spying on a character’s dreams reveals a piece of useful information: one of his Intimacies, a glimpse into a memory, a clue relevant to an ongoing investigation, etc.

If the Infernal’s roll also beats her target’s Resolve, she can twist his dreams into nightmares, preventing him from recovering Willpower from sleep. His Intimacies don’t modify his Resolve against this. If this leaves him with (Infernal’s Essence) or less temporary Willpower, he forms a Minor Tie of fear toward the Infernal, though he recognizes her only as a vague nightmarish presence until he encounters her in person.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used on a character once per day.
## [[Keys]]
#### Beguiling Demon Dream (Occult 4) (+3m)
For a three-mote surcharge, the Infernal can take on whatever form she pleases within the dream. She can convey an instill, inspire, or persuade roll through the dream instead of (or in addition to) inflicting nightmares. Her interactions with the dreamer aren’t limited solely to the influence’s topic, but the Infernal can’t use other influence rolls or social actions against him.
#### Oneiric Eye Voyeur (Occult 4)
The Infernal learns an additional piece of information from her target’s dreams.
#### Glimpse of Distant Nightmares (Occult 5) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to send a dream to a character within (Essence x10) miles. If he isn’t currently sleeping, he experiences it the next time he sleeps. She must have interacted with him or something meaningful to him in the current story. With Occult 5, Essence 3, this Charm’s range becomes unlimited.
#### All-Seeing Incubus (Occult 4, Essence 2, [[#Oneiric Eye Voyeur (Occult 4)|Oneiric Eye Voyeur]]) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, the Infernal gains an additional piece of information for each extra success she rolls over her target’s Guile.
#### Baleful Parasite Phantasm ([[#All-Seeing Incubus (Occult 4, Essence 2, Oneiric Eye Voyeur (Occult 4) Oneiric Eye Voyeur ) (+1wp)|All-Seeing Incubus]], [[#Beguiling Demon Dream (Occult 4) (+3m)|Beguiling Demon Dream]])
The Infernal steals any Willpower her target recovers from his sleep and can use her influence to inflict a Minor Derangement or strengthen an existing Derangement by one step (Exalted, p. 168). Any of the target’s Intimacies that oppose the inflicted Derangement are weakened by one step, though the victim can spend one Willpower to preserve Defining Intimacies. This replaces this Charm’s usual influence.
