*The Devil-Prince cuts her foes’ spirit as easily as their flesh, revealing weakness where there was once strength.*

If the stylist hits with an attack, she also treats her attack roll’s successes as an instill roll against her target to create or strengthen a [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven Intimacy]]. He loses one Initiative if she beats his Resolve, which the stylist gains unless her foe spends Willpower to resist this influence.
### Mastery
If the stylist rolls 3+ extra successes over her target’s Resolve, the instilled Intimacy counts as one step stronger for the rest of the scene.
