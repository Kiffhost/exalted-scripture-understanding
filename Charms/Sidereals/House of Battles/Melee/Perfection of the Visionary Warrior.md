*As the Sidereal places a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden on the Shelf across her eyes, it adheres and begins to drip with dark blood, an omen of violence to come.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits
- She ignores vision-based penalties, even blindness.
- Once per round, she may reflexively clash an attack against her with a decisive attack. If she knows Instructive Riposte, she can clash attacks that aren’t made against her.
- She may raise her Parry with the Melee Excellency for one mote per +1 bonus.
- She ignores Parry penalties from surprise attacks.
For five motes, she can defend against an ambush with her full Parry and can also use other Charms against it.
- She waives the cost of using Excellencies to reduce the target number of Perception-based rolls with any Ability in combat.
