*The Lunar sees the secret dooms hanging over her prey.*
After successfully using [[Soul-Piercing Predator Gaze]], she rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Lore]]) to [[Introducing a Fact|introduce a fact]] about her target’s weakness, adding her extra successes from the original roll as a non-Charm bonus. This roll can be enhanced by applicable [[Intelligence]] [[Charms]]. She might reveal that a Dynast’s poor social standing stems from his weak bloodline, that a warrior’s illness was caused by a disease-god’s curse, or that a merchant’s financial ruin is the result of machinations by rivals in a nearby city. The Storyteller can still veto facts that contradict established details of the setting or interfere with the story. 
If the Lunar knows [[Scent of Midnight Dweomers]], she can [[Introducing a Fact|introduce facts]] explaining how her target’s weakness is caused by spirits, [[Templates/sorcery]], or other supernatural forces without needing an appropriate [[Lore]] background.
