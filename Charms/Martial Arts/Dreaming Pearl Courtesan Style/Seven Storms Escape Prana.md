Catching hold of the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan is like trying to remember last night’s dream—at first, one might be able to grasp it hazily, but as time passes, it slips away into nothingness. The Seven Storms Escape Prana subtracts dice equal to the martial artist’s Appearance from a roll made to oppose one of her disengage attempts, to rush her, or from the control roll of a clinch against her. If the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan’s successes on the opposed action exceed the Resolve of the opponent, then he must pay a point of Willpower to maintain his focus or else automatically fail the roll. 

## Mastery

The duration of this Charm is extended to one round, imposing the penalty on all applicable opposed actions.
