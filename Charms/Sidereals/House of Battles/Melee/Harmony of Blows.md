The patterns and flows of the battlefield hold no mysteries for the Sidereal; she perceives every opening and chooses her movements with precision. The Sidereal can use this Charm after crashing an enemy, succeeding on a gambit, or winning a clash to reflexively make a withering or decisive attack against that enemy.
