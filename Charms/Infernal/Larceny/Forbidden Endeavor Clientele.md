*The Infernal offers underhanded solutions to her criminal clientele, if only they will call upon her.*

The Infernal’s presence permeates a community roughly the size of a village or a city neighbourhood. As long as she remains there, those in the community who have trouble with the law or problems that can only be solved through criminal means will be drawn to her. They don’t need to actively seek out help, nor do they need to know the Infernal. Subtle cues will direct them to her — flickering shadows, half-glimpsed reflections, and strange omens.

Potential clients don’t understand why or how they’ve been drawn to the Infernal it’s up to her to convince them to share their problem and accept her help. She can use [[Cracked Cell Circumvention]] to enhance read intentions rolls to uncover such problems, instill rolls to convince clients to trust her, and persuade rolls to convince them to accept her help.

Once the Infernal agrees to help another character, she no longer draws new clients. Instead, she gains the following benefits:
- She can use [[Cracked Cell Circumvention]] on Larceny rolls, Stealth rolls, and Manipulation-based influence rolls that will help solve her client’s problem, even if they don’t involve escaping confinement.
- She gains +2 Resolve against any influence that would deter her from completing the job or weaken a positive Tie to her client.

Upon successfully resolving a client’s problems, the Infernal gains one Willpower and (Essence + 5) motes if the job required meaningful effort. If she ends this Charm before completing the job, she loses one Willpower.

The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to affect a larger community: a group of nearby villages, a small city, or a major district of a large city. She can use [[Cracked Cell Circumvention]] on rolls with any Ability that assist her client, except for attack rolls.
