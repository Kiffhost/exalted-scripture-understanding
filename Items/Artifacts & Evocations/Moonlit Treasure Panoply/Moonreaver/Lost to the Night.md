Moonreaver’s master banishes obstructions with a contemptuous stroke.
Bringing [[Moonreaver]] down on a mundane object, the wielder banishes it to the othermoon. This Evocation can’t be used on objects that are too large for the wielder to lift or wear, or on objects being used, worn, or carried by someone. The wielder can choose to banish objects temporarily, in which case they return at the end of the scene, or send them permanently to the othermoon.
Objects are exposed to the othermoon’s freezing cold while banished, and may return the worse for wear.
The Storyteller may require an ([[Intelligence]] + [[Melee]]) roll to banish objects that are especially durable or narratively significant, like a locked door in the way of an important goal. The difficulty is half that of a feat of demolition to destroy the object, rounded up (Exalted, p. 231). Such objects can’t be banished permanently.
The wielder can use this Evocation reflexively when she kills an enemy to banish his corpse. No roll is necessary, though especially powerful or narratively significant characters’ corpses can only be banished temporarily.
## Resonant
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the wielder can permanently banish objects significant enough to require a roll. Alternatively, she can temporarily banish artifacts and other magical objects, rolling against difficulty ([[Artifact]] + 2), or a similar difficulty for non-artifacts.
