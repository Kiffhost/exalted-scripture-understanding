# [[Citrine Poxes of Contagion Style]]
This style is a contemplation on decay, both causing and reversing it. It was created long ago by the Joybringer and physician Perdurance of Blossoms, who sought aid from the Three Supreme Plagues, Heaven’s foremost gods of disease. She seduced languid Kel-Aina, ruler of drunken moth sickness. Sylvi, the Crone of Fire, god of white sun fever, was won over by appeals to her storied pride. The nameless god of the uttermost West who presides over jigsaw organ condition forbade Perdurance of Blossoms from ever speaking of the favor they demanded, and so it remains unknown.
Understanding disease, injury, and similar ailments as stemming from imbalances in one’s [[Essence]], this style’s students inflict strange, terrible diseases by imbalancing enemies’ [[Essence]] and curing maladies by resolving the underlying imbalance from which they arise. Students study anatomy and memorize catalogs of diseases and their cures. This foundation undergirds esoteric regimens that hone a stylist’s awareness and control of the flow of [[Essence]] through their body until they can exert its full force through a fingertip or a [[needle]]’s point.
