*The guilty cannot hide their secrets from the deathknight’s gaze.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses one of its two techniques: Cunning Scrutiny Style, which enhances [[Case Scene]] rolls, or Guilt-Sensing Eye, which enhances [[Profile Character]] rolls.
Each technique lets the Abyssal add ([[Essence]]) successes and doubling 9s on its respective action’s roll, and complete the action in a handful of seconds.
The Abyssal can repurchase this Charm to learn the second technique.
