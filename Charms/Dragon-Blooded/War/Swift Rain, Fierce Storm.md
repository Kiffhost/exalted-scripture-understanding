The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s archers sweep across the battlefield like gathering storm clouds, unleashing volleys that darken the sky and fall like rain. She enhances allied battle groups for three motes each, granting them an automatic success on movement rolls and ranged attack rolls made from medium range or further, and +1 Evasion. If an enhanced battle group has elite Drill, the dice bonus it provides on command actions to rally it or order ranged attacks or movement actions increases to three non-Charm dice.
If the Dragon-Blood is fighting under a stratagem she successfully enacted, she can use this Charm reflexively.
