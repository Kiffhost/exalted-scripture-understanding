*Many incorporeal spirits such as gods, demons, and ghosts are capable of assuming a material form, allowing them to interact with the mortal world.*
Doing so is equivalent to a Simple Charm activation and costs half their total mote pool and one point of Willpower, but this cost is not committed. Reverting back costs half as many motes as materializing, requires another Simple activation, and causes the spirit to fade back to its natural state over the course of a round, becoming fully immaterial on its next turn. 
[[Solar|Solars]] may learn Charms such as [[Spirit-Manifesting Word]] (see p. 355) to let allied spirits materialize without having to pay this steep cost.
