Strife’s Crucible severs the threads of battle, ending it on the Exalt’s terms. To use this Evocation, the wielder must choose the most powerful foe in the fight as her chosen opponent, and Crash him. (If multiple foes appear roughly tied for most powerful, she may choose any one.) She rolls ([[Initiative]]) as an influence roll against the [[Resolve]] of all enemies present in the scene, ignoring the penalty for [[Social Influence#One Target vs. Many Targets|group influence]]. Her chosen opponent succumbs to the influence with no chance to apply [[Resolve]]. If this roll beats all enemies’ [[Resolve]], combat ends. All characters drop out of [[Initiative]] order as everyone on the battlefield becomes apathetic to the outcome, no longer certain why they were fighting in the first place. Any character — friend or foe — other than her chosen opponent that wishes to reinitiate hostilities may enter a Decision Point, invoking a Major or stronger [[Intimacy]] to spend one [[Willpower]]. Once any character does so, all other characters may join the renewed hostilities without needing to resist. The wielder doesn’t roll [[Join Battle]], instead returning to her [[Initiative]] at the time she used this Evocation. Her chosen opponent enters battle in crash at [[Initiative]] −10. [[Final Blood Sanction]] can only be used once per story, unless reset by defeating a chosen opponent of considerable strength who threatens or opposes one of the wielder’s Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience points. It awakens at no cost when the wielder forms or strengthens a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards her chosen opponent in battle. 

## Resonant

An enemy that wishes to reinitiate hostilities must have an [[Essence]] equal to or higher than the wielder’s, and must call upon a Defining [[Intimacy]] in the Decision Point.
