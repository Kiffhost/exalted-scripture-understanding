The Solar draws the legend of Creation from deep within her consciousness. This Charm supplements an attempt to introduce or challenge a fact (p. 237), awarding one automatic success and rerolling 6s until 6s no longer appear. If the Exalt has learned Immanent Solar Glory (p. 334), the Solar may always roll to establish her knowledge, even if the Storyteller determines she succeeds without a roll.
