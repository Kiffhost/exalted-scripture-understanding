Cunning and full of tricks, the Lunar eludes even the greatest hunters.
The Lunar doubles 8s on a withdraw roll or a Stealth roll to go to ground. Alternatively, she can disengage from enemies at short range, as long as she has at least a −1 wound penalty.
Wounded Beast Flight waives this Charm’s Initiative cost if the Lunar has at least a −2 wound penalty.
Wounded Beast Flight can enhance rolls to go to ground when used with this Charm.
