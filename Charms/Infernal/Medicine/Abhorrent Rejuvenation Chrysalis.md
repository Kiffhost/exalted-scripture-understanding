*The Infernal cocoons her patient in a Chrysalis Grotesque to hasten his healing.*

The Infernal rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) as she touches a willing or helpless character, causing a Chrysalis Grotesque to manifest around him. She rerolls 6s until they cease to appear, and adds two non-Charm successes if she rerolls at least three 6s, she adds two non-Charm successes on the roll.

After (3 + target’s damaged health levels) hours, the patient emerges from the chrysalis, healing levels of non-aggravated damage equal to the Infernal’s successes. His wounds seem strange and unsettling — they suppurate foul-smelling pus as they heal, scab over with living brass, or pulsate unnervingly as something moves under his skin. These side effects lasts only a few days.
## [[Keys]] 
#### Baleful Wounds Unwoven
Instead of healing non-aggravated damage, the Infernal can use this Charm to convert all aggravated damage a character suffers to lethal damage. If her total successes exceed the levels of aggravated damage her patient has, each additional success heals a level of non-aggravated damage (including those converted to lethal by her roll).
#### Chrysalis-Crucible Understanding (Medicine 4, Essence 2)
If the Infernal enhances the roll with a full Excellency, she always receives the automatic successes. This also reduces the time needed for her patient to convalesce by (her Essence) hours, to a minimum of one hour.
#### Grotesque Rebirth Emergence (Medicine 5, Essence 3, [[#Baleful Wounds Unwoven]], [[#Chrysalis-Crucible Understanding (Medicine 4, Essence 2)|Chrysalis-Crucible Understanding]])
Once per scene, the Infernal can use this Charm to create a Chrysalis Grotesque that only takes until the beginning of her target’s next turn to heal him. However, the Infernal’s effective successes on the roll are capped at (Essence). She can reset this succeeding on a difficulty 5+ Medicine roll, other than the roll for this Charm.
