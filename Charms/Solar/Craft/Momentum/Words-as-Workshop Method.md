The Solar speaks the implements of her trade into existence. Upon using this Charm, the Exalt describes [[Artifact]] tools she needs to complete the present task, be it one of [[Craft]], [[Lore]], [[Medicine]], [[Occult]], or [[Investigation]]. The [[Essence]] of the world shapes itself into an artifact matching her description, with powers and active [[Evocations]] commensurate to the Exalt’s description and the Storyteller’s whims. The Exalt may use said Artifacts without paying an attunement cost, but if she wishes to lend them out, the borrower must pay an attunement cost in order to use them. Such Artifacts can be as simple or complex as needed, and may even have personalities. With each use of this Charm, the Solar may describe up to ([[Essence]]) tools, but the Storyteller should be aware of diminishing returns; the overall effectiveness should be based on the player’s stunts and descriptions. In any case, these [[Artifact]] assistants allow for unspecified bonuses ranging from non-Charm dice, to the ability to listen for a daiklave’s heartbeat, to holding a patient’s soul in place while the Solar performs continual, complex surgery to fix horrific injury. Using [[Craftsman Needs No Tools]] with appropriate created Artifacts may allow the Exalt to work on superior or legendary [[Artifact]] projects at inopportune moments, with a stunt. Artifacts created by this Charm vanish in a blaze of [[Essence]] as soon as the Exalt is finished using them, or at the end of the scene, whichever comes first. Repairing and Reforging
