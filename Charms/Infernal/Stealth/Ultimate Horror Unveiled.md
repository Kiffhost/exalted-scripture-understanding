*There is no safety from the Infernal, merely the vain hope that she will never reveal herself.*

The Infernal’s player can use this Charm during a scene in which she isn’t present, revealing that she’s already there. Her player must explain how she was able to accomplish this. She rolls (Dexterity + Stealth) to establish concealment, opposed by the Awareness rolls of any characters with magical senses. If she fails, it turns out she isn’t there.

Depending on the circumstances, the Storyteller can set a difficulty that the Infernal’s roll must meet for her to accomplish this infiltration at all, in addition to her enemy’s opposed rolls: for example, difficulty 2-4 for a well-guarded military camp, difficulty 5-7 for a magically warded manse, or difficulty 10 for a Third Circle demon’s impenetrable fortress.

If the Infernal uses this Charm to appear in combat, she uses her Stealth roll as her Join Battle roll. She may reflexively make a withering or decisive surprise attack against an enemy.
## Special activation rules
On a successful roll, the Infernal can reflexively use a Simple Stealth or Larceny Charm that has a duration of one scene or longer. She waives its Willpower cost if it has one.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through infiltration, disguise, or assassination. Even then, it can’t be used more than once per scene.
