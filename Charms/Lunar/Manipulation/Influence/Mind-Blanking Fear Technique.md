If the Lunar was in that scene, she adds (Essence) successes on the roll. She might tell him he saw nothing when he broke into the prince’s chambers last night, cryptically remark on a conversation he had with a local merchant in a threatening tone, or similar. If successful, he’s convinced that his memories of that scene never happened — it was only a nightmare, trick of his imagination, hallucination, or similar figment. This can’t be resisted by spending Willpower. Thetargetgains+(Lunar’sextrasuccesses/2,roundedup) Resolve against influence that contradicts his disbelief in the targeted memory. A character may break this Psyche effect by presenting the victim with direct evidence that the scene occurred and overcoming his boosted Resolve.
