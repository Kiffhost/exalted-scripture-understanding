*The Solar champion Vaznia took up dozens of artifacts across the ages, but few held her interest for long. Among those arms were [[Sirrush]] and Anshar, a pair of artifact [[Flame Piece|flame pieces]] she commissioned to match a favored concubine’s eyes. She gifted them to her lieutenant Rylo Stormsong without ever wielding them in battle. A thrill-seeker, Rylo went looking for trouble in every teahouse and dark alley of Old Wu-Jian. Thus she entangled herself in all manner of violent altercations, from battling armies of thugs sent by double-crossed crime lords to stealing relics from hidden shrines to forbidden undersea gods. In extricating herself from such situations she employed her twin devil casters to deadly effect. Eventually she found herself outmatched, hunted by an affronted sorcerer’s sea demons. Leaping from the pinnacle of the Crescent Temple into the sea-spray to escape pursuit, she never surfaced. 
[[Sirrush]] was found a thousand years later by Wu-Jian mudlarks. It worked its way up through the city’s teeming layers in cutthroat deals and throat-cut thefts, until one of the now-defunct Lords Criminal traded it to the outcaste pirate Storm Mother’s Son for a cargo of firedust. Sirrush’s counterpart Anshar remains lost.*
