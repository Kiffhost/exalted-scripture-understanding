The Dragon-Blooded general lures her enemies into battle within the depths of an eerie fogbank, trapping them within a prison of water. This Charm creates a unique magical stratagem with threshold 3 that shrouds the battlefield with a heavy mist, forcing enemies to fight against the confusion and disarray amid their own ranks before they can even contend with her forces. When the Dragon-Blood rolls [[Join Battle]] after successfully enacting this stratagem, she designates a point on the battlefield to be the center of the fog. The cloud extends out to long range from this point. The fog imposes a −2 penalty on all affected vision-based rolls and on any attacks made from medium range or beyond. Enemy battle groups caught in the fog take a −1 penalty on rolls to resist rout. A character that wishes to target them with a command action must pay one [[Initiative]] to do so, and takes a −2 penalty on the roll. If a battle group suffers dissolution after being routed in the mist, the Dragon-Blood gains [[Initiative]] equal to (its Size/2, rounded up). The Dragon-Blood cannot gain more than ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] in a single round this way. Normal winds and weather conditions won’t disperse the mist, but magically created wind or weather-manipulating magic, including the intervention of elementals, can do so. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless the Dragon-Blooded resets it by roleplaying a scene in which she gains a concrete advantage over an enemy that adds dice to a Strategic Maneuver roll (Exalted, p. 212) through deception, subterfuge, or treachery.
