*With a wretched cooing noise, the necromancer calls forth a clutch of creeping, writhing pyreworms — centipedes of congealed pyreflame who feed on passion.*
The necromancer touches her target, requiring a difficulty 3 gambit in combat. On success, pyreworms mass and burrow harmlessly into his skin and wrap themselves around his heart. When he invokes an [[Intimacy]] based on passionate feelings to resist influence or is affected by an [[inspire]] roll to create these feelings, he must either pay one [[Willpower]] or roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) at a difficulty of (necromancer’s [[Manipulation]]). If he fails, he suffers (necromancer’s Essence/2, rounded up) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]].
The spell ends when the necromancer releases the target or once he’s spent (higher of necromancer’s [[Essence]] or 3) total [[Willpower]]. The victim may dramatically embody their lack of passion as if it was a [[Flaws|Flaw]] (Exalted, p. 167) to earn an Expression Bonus for the session.
## Control
The hot glow of a symbiotic pyreworm is visible beneath the necromancer’s unclothed chest.
She may spend three motes or one [[Willpower]] to reduce the intensity of one of her own emotion-based Intimacies or feelings created by an inspire action for one scene.
## Distortion (9)
A rival necromancer may loosen the pyreworms from their host’s heart, granting him a non-Charm bonus on his next roll to resist the hazard and reducing the total [[Willpower]] to break the spell by one.
