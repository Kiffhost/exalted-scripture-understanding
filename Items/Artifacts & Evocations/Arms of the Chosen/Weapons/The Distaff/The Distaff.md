*Storytellers say that Prince Aridara of Cynosure was born with a silver knife in her hand.*
With it she cut her way free from a breech birth, and as she grew, the blade grew with her. At first she used the sword, named Dragonfly, for things of grace and beauty. Flowers she cut from the garden glowed bright for weeks in palace vases; goose feathers she trimmed into quills drew calligraphy as pure as a swan’s wing. Then war came to Cynosure. She turned the blade to bloodletting; it learned darker lessons, becoming as cruel as those it slew. At war’s end, Aridara vowed never to take another mortal life. She swathed her sword in silk so it could draw no more blood, then set out on pilgrimage across desert and mountain until she reached the Dreaming Sea. There she eschewed the works of the mighty for the life of a traveling peddler, aiding the ordinary folk of the Dreaming Sea with small kindnesses and subtle sorceries. Dragonfly slumbered in its swaddling-silks, learning gentleness anew as it became a distaff from which its mistress wove many a wonder. Only when the Prince of Fallen Fire personally petitioned her did Aridara deign to return to distant Cynosure — but that is another story. [[The Distaff]] has the shape of a sword, but it is completely tangled in raw silk from point to pommel. A shimmering moon-gray outer layer — shot with silver, as though it had leached away some of the sword’s metal — conceals twining veins of the most brilliant colors. Beneath its wielder’s fingertips, the silk moves like a living thing, whether to weave itself into lovely cloth or to tangle enemy limbs and blades. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the Distaff

The Distaff’s silk is spun from the weapon’s [[Essence]]. Its threads move almost as an extension of the Exalt’s will, coming together in intricate patterns and assuming any imaginable color without needle or loom. It is an exceptional tool for [[Craft]] actions involving weaving and related areas of specialty (Exalted, p. 580). The Distaff’s threads cling to its wielder’s wrist so that the blade may not be wrested away. The wielder gains +1 [[Defense|Parry]] against Disarm gambits, and their difficulty increases by 1.
