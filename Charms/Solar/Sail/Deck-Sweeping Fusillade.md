*The Solar’s commands ignite a desire for victory in her crew, steeling their senses and honing their training into an awesome ballistic onslaught.*
This Charm supplements a broadside maneuver (p. 245), adding bonus dice to the naval maneuver roll, and treating the result as if it were ([[Essence]]) successes higher than it really is. The bonus dice on this Charm are equal to the Solar’s [[Essence]], but the price changes based on her permanent [[Essence]]. From [[Essence]] 1-4, the cost of this Charm is two motes. At [[Essence]] 5+, it costs three motes, and at [[Essence]] 8+ it costs four.
