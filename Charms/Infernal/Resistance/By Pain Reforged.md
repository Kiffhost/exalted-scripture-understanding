*Pain puts life in perspective, pushing aside all other distractions.*

The Infernal’s wound penalty is reduced by one. If she doesn’t have any lethal or aggravated damage in her health track, this increases to (Stamina/2, rounded down).

If the Infernal’s Incapacitated health level is filled with bashing damage, she can continue to act normally, though she no longer negates her wound penalty. Once she takes any lethal or aggravated damage, she’s incapacitated as usual.
