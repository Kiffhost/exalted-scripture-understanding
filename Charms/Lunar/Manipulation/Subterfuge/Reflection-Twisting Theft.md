Reaching into a mirror or similar surface, the Lunar draws forth a mundane object’s reflection. This is a perfect copy of the original, except that it’s reflected left-to-right. Noticing this inversion is impossible without magic; even then, it requires a (Perception + [Awareness, Bureaucracy, or Investigation]) roll at difficulty (Lunar’s Essence + Manipulation). This is true even if the inversion would normally impede the object’s function — readers notice nothing amiss about a book whose contents are written backwards, and can still read it. As long as the duplicate remains in existence, the original object casts no reflection.
