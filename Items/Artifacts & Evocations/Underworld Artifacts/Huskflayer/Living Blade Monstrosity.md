*A rippling mass of rotting flesh engulfs Huskflayer’s killing edge, making its monstrous blade seem many times larger.*
Huskflayer’s wielder can spend gore points to add that many dice of decisive damage to an attack, up to a maximum of her [[Initiative]]. If she spends 3+ gore points this way, she also adds an automatic success on the damage roll.
## Dissonant
The wielder can’t add more than (higher than [[Essence]] or 3) damage dice.
## Resonant
If the wielder spends 6+ gore points, she adds two successes on the damage roll, not one.
