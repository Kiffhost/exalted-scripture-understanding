The Dragon-Blood rises from the depths of the earth to drag her victims down into the endless dark. To use this Charm, she must be using Sleeping Dragon’s Lair. She makes an unexpected grapple gambit against an enemy who’s unaware of her, without leaving concealment. If she successfully establishes control of the grapple, she drags her victim back into the earth with her, as per Sleeping Dragon’s Lair. This disappearance goes unwitnessed, and the entombed character can’t be detected or perceived for the grapple’s duration unless a character successfully detects the Dragon-Blood.
The Dragon-Blood can make savaging attacks, slams, or throws against a grappled victim without breaking concealment, instead rolling (Dexterity + Stealth) reflexively with an additional –1 penalty after the attack.
Enemies whose (Perception + Awareness) rolls beat the Dragon-Blood’s successes can detect her presence underground, even if they lack the magic normally required to contest Sleeping Dragon’s Lair.
If the grapple ends, the Dragon-Blood’s victim may reflexively emerge from his burial. If the Dragon-Blood incapacitates him before that, his body will rise from the earth after (Dragon-Blood’s Essence) rounds, although this is insufficient for onlookers to pinpoint the Dragon-Blood’s exact current location.
