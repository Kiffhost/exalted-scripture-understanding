*The Infernal crowns her bestial companion with the same emerald flames that burn within her soul, proclaiming him a beast of Hell.*

The Infernal confers the following benefits on one of her animal familiars. The familiar often changes in appearance, taking on a more demonic aspect.
### Infernal Will Emanation
When the Infernal shares her familiar’s senses (Exalted, p. 161), she ignores the range limit, and she can do so even while asleep. With Survival 5, she can control her familiar’s actions while sharing senses.
### Terrifying Devil-Beast
If the familiar acts in a hostile or threatening way, animals and First Circle demons count as having a Minor Tie of fear toward it.
### Transcendent Desert Companion
The familiar gains the benefits of [[Transcendent Desert Creature]].
### Undying Loyalty
The familiar gains a Defining Tie of loyalty to the Infernal. Any influence that would make it act against this tie is unacceptable, unless it’s the Infernal’s own influence.

This Charm’s experience point cost is waived the first time the Infernal uses it.
