A world-walker experienced in the ways of countless peoples, the Lunar fits into strange societies as though she’d lived among them her entire life. She makes a special read intentions roll to understand a cultural custom, at a difficulty based on the custom’s obscurity and secrecy. Identifying an everyday greeting might be difficulty 1-2; a yearly harvest rite might be difficulty 3-4; a coming-of-age ritual practiced only by societal elites might be difficulty 5+. If she has an applicable [[Lore]] background, she may roll with [[Lore]] instead of [[Socialize]]. Success reveals the observed custom’s nature and purpose, letting the Lunar perform it faultlessly. If she does engage in the custom that scene, she gains one [[Willpower]]. In addition, this roll counts as a successful read intentions roll against each participant in the custom whose [[Guile]] is beaten, revealing an [[Intimacy]] that’s relevant to the custom or to a fellow participant. The Lunar learns nothing on failure, or if the observed behavior isn’t part of a cultural or societal custom. This Charm may only be used once per scene.
