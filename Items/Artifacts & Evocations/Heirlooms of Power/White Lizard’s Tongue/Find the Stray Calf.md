*Herds branded by [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/Heirlooms of Power/White Lizard’s Tongue/White Lizard’s Tongue]] aren’t easily stolen from its master, nor do her foes easily escape her.*
The wielder adds (higher of [[Ride]] or [[Survival]]) dice on a roll to track a branded character, or half that many dice, rounded up, on an [[Awareness]] or [[Investigation]] roll to detect a branded character or evidence left by one.
## Resonant
The dice added on [[Tracking]] rolls are nonCharm, and the bonus on [[Awareness]] and [[Investigation]] rolls isn’t halved.
