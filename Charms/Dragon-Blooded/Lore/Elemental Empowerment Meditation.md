Trance The Dragon-Blood replenishes her spirit with elemental power drawn from her understanding of Creation. Once per day, when she uses Elemental Concentration Trance to roll (Intelligence + Lore) at difficulty 3+, she may pay one Willpower or one lethal health level before rolling to gain motes equal to twice her threshold successes on the roll. These motes can only be spent on Charms of the same element as the one she meditated on, and last one day. If the Exalt knows Dragon-Kin Empowerment, she may pay this Charm’s cost to provide its benefits to a Hearthmate when she leads him through meditation. A character—either the Dragon-Blood or a Hearthmate — may only receive this benefit once per day.
