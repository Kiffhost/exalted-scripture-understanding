The Sidereal may not work an honest day in her life, but she knows how to look like she does. When the Sidereal lies about where she’s been, what she’s doing, or why she hasn’t done something, she seems to be telling the truth, halving penalties for implausible claims. Effects opposing her Guile can’t reveal any information to the contrary for the scene. The Sidereal can even contest lie-detecting magic like Judge’s Ear Technique, rolling (Manipulation + Journeys Ability) at −1 target number. Such is the intricacy of the Sidereal’s schemes that even when not using this Charm directly, it’s still difficulty to catch her out. Uncovering evidence of her slacking off, performing subpar work, not showing up, or otherwise neglecting her duties always requires a roll at a minimum difficulty of 3, no matter how obvious the evidence may be. Trivial characters can’t roll at all.
