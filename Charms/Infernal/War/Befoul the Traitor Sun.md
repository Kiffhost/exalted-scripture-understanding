*The Infernal’s wrath tears apart the skein of Creation, bidding the mad green sun bear witness to her victory.*

The Infernal makes Strategic Maneuver roll to enact a unique stratagem at difficulty 3. If she succeeds, the green sun dawns over the battlefield as combat begins, replacing the light of lesser suns or moons, while omen-weather spells eerie prophecies in the sky. This has the following effects:
- Enemies who roll fewer Join Battle successes than the Infernal are blinded until the end of their next turn.
- Enemies battle groups are exposed to [[Green Sun Wasting]] (p. XX) upon Joining Battle and again each time they lose a dot of Size.
- When the Infernal orders a battle group to make an attack against a crashed enemy, that foe is exposed to [[Green Sun Wasting]] if he suffers 3+ decisive damage from the attack.
- Enemy battle groups infected with green sun wasting lose the benefits of Might and suffer a −2 penalty on all rolls.
- The battle is obscured from divination and prophecy as if all combatants were enemies of fate.
