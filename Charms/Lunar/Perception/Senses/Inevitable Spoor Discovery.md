Scenting even the most imperceptible traces of her quarry, the Lunar is implacable in pursuit. She makes a tracking roll with (Essence) bonus dice, ignoring penalties from terrain and the tracks’ age. She can track a character from (Essence/2, rounded up) miles away, even if doing so would normally be impossible. If successful, the Lunar may commit this Charm’s mote cost to bank a pool of non-Charm successes equal to the 9s and 10s on her roll. She may add banked successes to Awareness or Survival rolls to detect the tracked character, Investigation rolls to profile him or examine his doings, or Socialize rolls to read his intentions. Banked successes remain available until they’re all spent or the Lunar ends her commitment.
