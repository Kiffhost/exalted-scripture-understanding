*All things belong to death; the Abyssal merely hastens its inevitable claim.*
After successfully stealing an object from someone, the Abyssal makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Larceny]]) instill roll against him. If successful, the target believes that the object belongs to the Abyssal, and always has. He can resist for one [[Willpower]], but must wait at least (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) minutes to do so, giving her time to flee the scene.
