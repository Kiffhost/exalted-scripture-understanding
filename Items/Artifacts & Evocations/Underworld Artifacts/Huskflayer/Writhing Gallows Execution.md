*As [[Huskflayer]] deals a telling blow, its scythe-blade splits into countless fleshy tendrils and talons, each hungry for more.*
Huskflayer’s wielder can use this Evocation when she crashes an enemy with a withering attack, forgoing the [[Initiative]] awarded by the damage roll and the [[Initiative]] Break and rolling that many dice of decisive damage against her victim.
If the wielder used [[Flensing Edge Torment]] on the withering attack, that Evocation’s [[Hardness]] reduction and gore bonus apply to the decisive damage roll.
## Special activation rules
The wielder can use [[Living Blade Monstrosity]] reflexively to enhance the decisive damage roll.
## Dissonant
This Evocation can only be used once per scene.
