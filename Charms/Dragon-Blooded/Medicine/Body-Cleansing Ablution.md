The Dragon-Blood calls upon water as a healing tool, washing away pain and purifying the body. She must spend at least an hour overseeing her patient as he bathes or washing his wounds with pure water. This treatment alleviatespain,allowingherpatienttoignore(hisStamina − 1) points of wound penalties for one day. In addition, if the Dragon-Blood has diagnosed any diseases or poisons he suffers from, he makes a single (Stamina + Resistance) roll. This is treated as a roll against the morbidity of each diagnosed disease, except that failure doesn’t intensify his symptoms. In addition, each success reduces the duration of any diagnosed poisons in by one interval. A character can only benefit from this Charm once per story.
