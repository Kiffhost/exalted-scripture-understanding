*The Abyssal is one with her arsenal, each weapon an extension of her killing intent.*
While the Abyssal has one full-cost attunement to an artifact weapon, she reduces the attunement cost of further artifact weapons by three motes each. This doesn’t stack with other discounts. It doesn’t matter what Ability the weapons use.
If the deathknight ends her full-cost attunement, she must commit enough motes to bring another attunement to its full cost, or else all discounted attunements end.
Special: This Charm may alternatively be learned as a [[Brawl]], [[Melee]], or [[Thrown]] Charm.
