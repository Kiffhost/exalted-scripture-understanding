A sorcerer with summoning spells such as [[Demon of the First Circle]] or [[Summon Elemental]] can easily amass large forces of spirits bound to her will. In combat, keep in mind that these should usually be represented as [[Battle Group|battle groups]] (p. 205) rather than giving each spirit its own turn, unless it is a distinct and powerful being such as a Second Circle demon.
