The martial artistâ€™s terrifying presence radiates across the battlefield, leaving her foes wary and unsure. Do they dare turn their backs on her, when at any moment she could suddenly be right behind them? Enemies who are at short or medium range to the martial artist must disengage to move away from her as though they were at close range, intimidated by her deadly elusive presence. They also take a -1 penalty to their Defense against surprise attacks made by her. 

## Mastery

The martial artist may rush enemies while in stealth.
