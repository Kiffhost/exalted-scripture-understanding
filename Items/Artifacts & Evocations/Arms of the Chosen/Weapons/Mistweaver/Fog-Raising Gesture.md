With elegant gestures, the Exalt knits the tendrils of mist that fall from her blade into a thick, opaque blanket of fog that encompasses everything within short range. It is thick, damp, quiet, and almost impossible to see through, imposing a −3 penalty on visual Awareness checks and a −1 penalty on other relevant Awareness checks. Gale winds or noonday desert heat can disperse this supernatural fog in as little as (Essence) turns. Even more powerful effects, such as hurricanes and volcanic heat, can disperse the fog instantly, while stunted area-effect Charms and spells can carve gaps and paths through it. Otherwise it stays in place until end of scene. The Exalt may continue to weave the mist, activating this Evocation on successive turns to expand its area. She waives its Willpower cost. Each additional turn spent mistweaving costs only four motes and either extends the blanket of fog out an additional range band — up to a maximum of (higher of Essence or 3) range bands — or fills in all carved-away sections (wielder’s choice). 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with jade, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she attunes Mistweaver.
