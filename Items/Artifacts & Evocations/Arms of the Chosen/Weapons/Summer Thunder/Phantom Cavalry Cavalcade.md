## Resonant

In order to awaken this Evocation, a character must resonate with orichalcum. One arrow falls as a hundred shining sparks; a hundred shining riders emerge from the earth. This Evocation summons a battle group of phantom horse-archers as per [[Evoke the Equestrian Echo]]. They have [[Size]] ([[Essence]] âˆ’ 2), elite [[Drill]], and [[Might]] 2. This Evocation can be used once per story. It resets when the Exalt experiences a major military victory or loss that ties into one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], such as surrendering to an enemy toward whom she has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loathing, or accepting the surrender of a demon army in accord with a [[Intimacy|Principle]] of magnanimity in victory.
