*Clothed in finery befitting a prince of the dead, the deathknight wields her wealth as a weapon.*
When the Abyssal openly flaunts her wealth as part of an influence roll with any Ability, she adds (her [[Resources]] – target’s [[Resources]]) non-Charm dice. She can always leverage her evident wealth as part of the action as though it were a Minor [[Intimacy]]. She also gains these benefits on threaten rolls that involve threats of financial repercussions.
If the Abyssal makes a significant financial expenditure in relation to a social event, like throwing a lavish masquerade or spending extravagantly on her wardrobe for a gala, this Charm’s duration is extended for the entirety of the event, and she doesn’t subtract her target’s [[Resources]] from her own do determine how many dice she adds. The [[Resources]] expended should equal the highest [[Resources]] rating possessed by any of her guests, minimum [[Resources]] 3.
