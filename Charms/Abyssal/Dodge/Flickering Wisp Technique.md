*The Abyssal dissolves into mist and shadow, crossing the killing field in a blink.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Shadow Fades at Dawn]] or [[Hanging Shrike Focus]], she can vanish and reappear at her destination without crossing the space between. She must be able to see the destination.
The deathknight can also pay two motes to gain this benefit when she uses the reflexive movement from a successful disengage.
