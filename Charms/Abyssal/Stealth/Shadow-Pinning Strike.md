*Stepping on her prey’s shadow or piercing it with her weapon, the Abyssal assassin pieces him as surely as if she’d struck flesh and bone.*
The Abyssal makes a special grapple gambit with any combat Ability to pin a foe’s shadow, rolling ([[Wits]] + [[Stealth]]) opposing her target’s ([[Dexterity]] + [Athletics or Dodge]) for the control roll. If the attack is unexpected, she adds her attack roll extra successes to the control roll, and it doesn’t break concealment.
She can extend her weapon’s range for this gambit by one band with stunts that make clever use of light and shadow.
If successful, the Abyssal can either remain directly atop her victim’s shadow, or leave her weapon embedded in it to maintain the clinch. [[Unarmed]] attacks and natural weapons can’t be embedded, while ranged attacks can only be embedded.
If the Abyssal pins her victim’s shadow directly, the grapple proceeds as usual, but the only grapple action she can take is to restrain or release her enemy. She doesn’t lose rounds of grapple control when she’s attacked, although she still loses control when damaged. Additionally, the grapple can be broken if she’s forcibly moved from her target’s shadow.
If the Abyssal embeds her weapon, she can’t take restrain actions, but doesn’t suffer any penalties for grappling. She doesn’t lose rounds of control when attacked or grappled. However, removing the embedded weapon frees the victim entirely. Pulling it free all at once is a difficulty 5 feat that requires [[Strength]] 5. A character can also spend his entire turn trying to dislodge the embedded weapon as an unrolled action to subtract two rounds of control.
