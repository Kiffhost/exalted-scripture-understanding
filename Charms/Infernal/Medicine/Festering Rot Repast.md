*The Infernal’s gluttony is at times mistaken for magnanimity.*

The Infernal feeds on a disease afflicting her target, rolling (Stamina + Medicine) against its morbidity. Success purges the sickness from her patient, even if the disease is incurable, but exposes the Infernal to the it. Instead of making a separate roll against the disease’s virulence to resist it, she uses half her successes on the initial roll, rounded down, to determine if she’s infected. She may choose not to resist.

If the Infernal diagnosed the disease with [[Plague-Savoring Palate]] and still has the Intimacy of hunger, she adds (Intimacy) non-Charm dice on the roll. Success strengthens the Intimacy by one step.
