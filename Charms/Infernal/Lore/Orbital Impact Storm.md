*The Infernal draws the fragments and debris of a broken world into a constellation of perfect motion, setting them in orbit around her.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have [[Mind-Hand Manipulation]] active. She telekinetically seizes any loose objects or debris within that Charm’s range, which float in an ever-accelerating orbit around her. If she wishes, she may reflexively make a telekinetic feat of demolition against any number of unattended objects within range, letting her rip cobblestones from streets or bricks from walls. However, even pebbles or clumps of dirt can be deadly at the speed with which they orbit the Infernal.

This constellation of debris pulverizes those who approach the Infernal, an environmental hazard extending out to [[Mind-Hand Manipulation]]’s full range. It has difficulty (Intelligence) and Damage (Essence, maximum 5)L/round. It doesn’t affect the Infernal or her allies.

The orbiting objects also impose a −1 penalty on attack rolls against the Infernal. This doesn’t apply against unblockable attacks or attacks that ignore cover.

The Infernal must pay one Initiative at the start of each of her turns to sustain this Charm, or else the suspended objects fall to the ground.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she activates [[Mind-Hand Manipulation]].
## [[Keys]]
#### Hostile Vector Realignment (Essence 3)
Once per round, when the Infernal telekinetically parries an attack at close range, she can counterattack with a telekinetic disarm gambit. If she succeeds, the disarmed weapon is caught in the orbiting debris, requiring a difficulty 5 feat of strength to retrieve.
#### Manifold Mind-Storm Onslaught (Essence 3)
The Infernal can use her turn to hurl the orbiting debris outward in all directions, extending one range band beyond [[Mind-Hand Manipulation]]’s usual range. This is a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 7, Damage (Essence + 3)L. This ends [[Orbital Impact Storm]].
