*Across scorching sands and numbing tundra, the Abyssal traveler walks without fear.*
The Abyssal ignores environmental penalties on Survival rolls, and doubles 9s on rolls to resist mundane environmental hazards. She also gains this benefit against supernatural hazards that are similar to perils found in nature, like a wall of sorcerous flame.
With a Survival 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Abyssal also subtracts (Stamina) dice from the damage of such mist banks. She can’t create fair weather — though she can dissipate it — nor can she improve foul weather.
She also can’t create extreme natural disasters like hurricanes. She doubles 9s if she uses this Charm in a shadowland or the Underworld, or if she has a Survival specialty relevant to either the weather or the terrain.
If both are true, she doubles 8s.
The roll’s difficulty depends on how drastic a change she wishes to make and how seasonally appropriate it is: creating a gloomy drizzle or turning a sunny day overcast would be difficulty 1; intensifying a heavy rain to a thunderstorm would be difficulty 2–3; calling a storm out of the blue would be difficulty 5+.
If the Abyssal succeeds, her desired changes take place over a matter of minutes or hours, depending on how extensive they are.
The weather can extend up to (Survival + extra successes) miles from where she used this Charm. It lasts until at least the end of this Charm’s duration. The Abyssal adds (Survival) dice on inspire rolls that benefit from the ambiance provided by the weather. With a suitable stunt, she can apply this bonus on other rolls.
If other magic would alter the Abyssal’s weather, the character responsible must make an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll opposed by the Abyssal’s ({Charisma or Wits} + Survival). If he fails, his magic is negated, and he can’t change the weather again for the rest of this Charm’s duration.
