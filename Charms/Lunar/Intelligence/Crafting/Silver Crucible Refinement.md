Dreams of success and nightmares of failure stoke the Lunar’s brilliance, burning away the dross of imperfection. She adds up to ([[Essence]], maximum 5) non-Charm dice on a [[Craft]] roll with any Attribute. Enhancing basic or major projects costs silver points; superior projects cost gold points; legendary projects cost white points. With [[Intelligence]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, craft points spent on this Charm also count toward the cost of a major, superior, or legendary project’s finishing roll (Exalted, pp. 240-242).
