*Time seems to slow as the Lunar acts on well-honed instinct.*
This Charm must be used at the start of the round. The Lunar adds (higher of [[Dexterity]] or [[Wits]]) to her [[Initiative]] to determine when she acts. If she uses her turn to attack an enemy who hasnâ€™t acted that round, she adds a non-Charm die.
