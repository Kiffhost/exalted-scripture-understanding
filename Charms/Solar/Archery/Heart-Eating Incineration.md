The Solar’s judgment scourges her target with devouring flames. She may only pay to use this attack when unleashing Solar Spike, and when her anima is at bonfire. Instead of conjuring Solar Spike, the Solar draws her anima as if she were pulling an arrow from a quiver, her iconic manifestation taking the form of a living, screaming missile. This attack follows the rules of Solar Spike, but adds the Solar’s Initiative to the raw damage of the attack. This does cause the Lawgiver’s Initiative to reset on a hit, but if Heart-Eating Incineration kills her target, the target’s body and soul are engulfed in a torrent of flames and burned away completely, restoring a number of motes to the Solar equal to her Intimacy rating for the target plus his permanent Essence score. Using Heart-Eating Incineration resets the Solar’s anima to the dim level. Spirits destroyed with this attack may still reform as they normally might.
