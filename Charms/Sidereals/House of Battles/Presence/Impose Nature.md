*The Sidereal blesses another with the experience of being her, leaving a ghostly imprint of her Caste Mark on his left hand.*
The Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Presence) to instill one of her Major or Defining Intimacies in a single target.
His Intimacies don’t modify his Resolve against this roll.
Success instills the Intimacy at Major intensity in a rush of emotions. It subsides to Minor once the scene ends.
Affected characters gain Willpower from upholding the Intimacy as if it were Defining. Once per session, they may treat it as Defining for one of their own Charms or other beneficial effects.
The mark left by this influence can’t be seen after the instant in which this Charm is used except by characters capable of seeing the dematerialized. It vanishes if the target ever erodes that Intimacy.
