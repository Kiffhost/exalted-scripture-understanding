*The Sidereal postpones the hour of her patient’s death, making his wounds seem to vanish.*
After a few minutes spent treating herself or another patient, the Sidereal rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) at a difficulty of (1 + patient’s base wound penalty). Success heals (1 + extra successes) levels of non-aggravated damage, which are held in abeyance for this Charm’s duration. The deferred damage diminishes over time with the patient’s natural healing (Exalted, p. 173), once any damage remaining in his health track has been healed. If this Charm ends before all damage is healed, the remaining levels are inflicted on the patient.
