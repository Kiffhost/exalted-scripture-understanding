*The Infernal's arrow crackles with ebon lightning that burns away the passions of those it strikes.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when a decisive attack roll beats her target's Resolve, before the damage roll. She doubles 10s on the damage roll. If she deals any damage, she also weakens one of his Intimacies based on emotion by one step. This begins with his weakest Intimacies, eroding Major or Defining Intimacies only if the target doesn't have any lower-intensity Intimacies. The Storyteller chooses which Intimacy is eroded, but the Infernal's player can specify an emotion to target. If her enemy doesn't have any Intimacies based on that emotion, the Storyteller should choose an Intimacy that still feels related to the chosen emotion, if possible.
