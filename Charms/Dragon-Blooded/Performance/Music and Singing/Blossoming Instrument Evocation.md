*Nature itself yearns for the sweet music of the Dragon-Blood, offering itself up as the instrument of her harmony.*
A tree branch will reshape itself into a sanxian should she have need of it, and reeds become flutes of unsurpassed beauty in her hands. She may create a musical instrument from any living plant. If she has a [[Performance]] specialty in that instrument, it’s an exceptional tool (Exalted, p. 580). Once this Charm’s duration ends, the instrument reverts back to its natural form.
