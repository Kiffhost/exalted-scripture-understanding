*The martial artist is as death herself, her blade offering a final release to those whose time has come.*
The stylist may pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Violet Bier of Sorrows Form to gain the following additional benefits
- Her withering attacks add (Strength) Overwhelming.
- When she crashes an enemy, his wound penalty is doubled until he leaves crash. This doesn’t stack with other effects that multiply wound penalties.
- When she lands a decisive attack that resets her Initiative, she adds her enemy’s wound penalty to her base Initiative, maximum (stylist’s Wits).
If this incapacitates him, he counts as having a −5 penalty.
- Incapacitating a nontrivial enemy awards her one Willpower.
