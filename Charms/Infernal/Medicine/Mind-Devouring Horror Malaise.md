*The Infernal is one with pestilence. She speaks with the voice of fever; she flows through tainted veins; she awakens a hunger that can never be sated.*

The Infernal subverts the will of any character who suffers a disease that she’s inflicted on them, or a disease that she’s diagnosed or treated and discussed with them. No matter where they may be, such characters suffer the following:
- They treat the disease as both a Tie of helpless submission to the Infernal and a Tie of hunger toward anything made of meat, with the same intensity as the disease. If the Infernal makes an influence roll that’s supported by the Tie, its Resolve penalty and the Willpower cost to resist both increase by one.
- They suffer a penalty equal to the disease’s intensity on rolls opposing the Infernal and on rolls against poison, disease, or similar ailments. It also applies on other characters’ rolls to treat such ailments. The penalty subtracts successes for ailments inflicted by the Infernal.
- They can consume meat for sustenance, but not any other foods.

This Charm also affects carriers infected with [[Exquisite Contagion Connoisseur]]. They count as having the disease at Major intensity. It drops to Minor if the Infernal releases the mote committed to them, but they remain carriers for as long as this Charm is active.
