Those who shun the perfected path deserve only the mercy of a proper burial. Immediately after crashing an opponent, the wielder prays for nearby earth and stone to rise and entomb the fallen, reflexively rolling an unblockable gambit with difficulty 4. Success seals the opponent in a rocky tomb without light, air, or room to move. Shattering the tomb is a Strength 3 feat of strength, with a difficulty of (the wielder’s Essence), or (the wielder’s Essence + the dedicated Principle) if that enemy has violated the Principle. Outside of combat, each roll takes 20 seconds to complete, and time is of the essence as the sealed character asphyxiates (Exalted, p. 232). Ghosts, demons, and other creatures of darkness suffocate and die within the tomb as if made of flesh and blood, sending ghosts to Lethe and destroying other beings permanently, with the exception of Yozis, Deathlords, and similarly powerful beings. More wholesome spirits reform, if able, sealed within the tomb until freed. This Evocation may be used once per day, unless reset by instilling a nontrivial opponent with the Principle Faith’s Pillar is pledged to at Major Intensity. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation. 

## Dissonant

A character dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation. 

## Resonant

If the wielder slays a spirit with a decisive attack, she may use this Evocation to entomb it without rolling a gambit.
