*Ajelin’s moonsilver seeps through skin and burrows into muscle, rooting itself in its wielder’s flesh as she becomes the perfect sword.*
## Resonant
Only characters resonant with Ajelin can awaken this Evocation.
The wielder may pay a surcharge of five motes and one aggravated health level when she uses [[Accursed Blade Embodiment]] to gain the following benefits:
 - She suffers a [[Limit Break]] appropriate to Ajelin’s curse (p. 100) until the end of the scene, even if she doesn’t normally have [[Limit]] Breaks. This doesn’t reset her [[Limit]].
 - She adds that Evocation’s damage bonus on all decisive attacks.
 - She adds (Enmity) to her base [[Initiative]] and to the amount of [[Initiative]] she receives for crashing enemies.
 - She’s immune to crippling effects.
 - [[Influence]] that would dissuade her from battle or that opposes her Enmity is unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220) and must be rejected.
A Lunar with [[Mastering Cursed Silver]] may roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) at difficulty 7 when she uses this Evocation. If successful, she doesn’t enter [[Limit Break]].
