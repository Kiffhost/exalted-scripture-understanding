*The Infernal recognizes the totality of truth, sifting out falsehoods with inhuman clarity.*

The Infernal can tell if someone is lying when he makes a statement. If the statement contains partial or incomplete truths, she discerns which parts of the statement are false or misleading. If she uncovers deception, she instantly forms a negative Minor Tie to the liar.

Against magic capable of contesting this perfect discernment, the Infernal rolls (Perception + Investigation) for her opposed roll, adding (Essence) automatic successes. The opposing character’s 1s and 2s subtract successes from his roll.
