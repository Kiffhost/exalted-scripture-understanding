*Shadows ooze and lash from the Infernal’s anima, entwining a rival in umbral tendrils that rob him of both luck and skill.*

When the Infernal makes an opposed roll with any Ability, opposing characters’ 1s and 2s subtract successes. If a character has a Major or Defining Intimacy that supports his action, only his 1s subtract successes. This also applies to any of this Charm’s keys that apply to 2s.

Alternatively, the Infernal can use this Charm on a roll against a static value, like an attack, inflicting a −3 penalty. This is reduced to −2 by a relevant Major or Defining Intimacy.

If the Infernal succeeds with at least one extra success, characters whose rolls or static value were penalized gain a Minor Tie of self-loathing toward themselves and a Minor Tie of resentment toward the Infernal. He suffers −2 Resolve against the Infernal for the rest of the scene.

## [[Keys]] 
#### Mere Wounds Mocked
The Infernal can use this Charm after being hit by an attack, imposing its penalty on the damage roll.
#### Damning Petulance Technique (Essence 4)
As long as an enemy rolls any 1s or 2s on an opposed, he loses an additional two successes, or one success if he has a valid Intimacy. If the Infernal makes a roll against a static value, the penalty inflicted increases to −5, or −3 with a valid Intimacy.
