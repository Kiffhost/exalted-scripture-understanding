Smiling Yathe speaks, his voice sizzling like a drop of acid in the wielder’s mind.
The gauntlets’ wearer can communicate with Smiling Yathe while meditating. Yathe is always eager to offer his counsel. He advises ruthlessness in all things, proposing the cruelest solutions to the wielder’s problems.
However, Yathe isn’t cruel for cruelty’s sake — he advises only what he sincerely believes is the most effective course of action.
Yathe’s primary areas of knowledge are poison, spirits, and preying on emotional vulnerabilities, along with the gauntlets and their history. Communing with him lets the wielder use these topics as Lore backgrounds to introduce facts.
Yathe and the wielder can use social influence normally while communing. Yathe’s social traits are listed below.
He always has a Defining Tie toward his wielder, with a context depending on her conduct thus far. He admires those who share his ruthless pragmatism, while disdaining compassion, complacency, and indecision.
Awakening: This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience. It awakens for free when the wielder upholds a Major or Defining Intimacy through ruthless pragmatism, cruelty, or mockery.
