*Honing her skill with a gem-cutterâ€™s precision, the Dragon-Blood perfects her handiwork.*
She rerolls ([[Essence]]) non-1 failures on a supplemented roll. For each rerolled die that shows a success, the Dragon-Blood gains one silver craft point in addition to any rewards from the project itself. Rerolled dice that show 10s grant gold craft points instead.
