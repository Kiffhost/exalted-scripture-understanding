The Lunar and her swarming duplicates fight as one.
When the Lunar rolls Join Battle, she adds a bonus die for each Cunning Anglerfish Decoy duplicate within long range, maximum (higher of Essence or 3). She banks a pool of swarm points equal to the 9s and 10s on the roll that can be spent on the following effects: 1 point: Prevent a replica within long range from being dissipated by an attack. For replicas enhanced with Ant-and-Starfish Trick, this instead prevents a decisive attack’s damage from filling their Incapacitated health level.
1 point: The Lunar waives Engulfing Swarm Embrace’s cost.
1+ points: While within close range of a duplicate, the Lunar can add automatic successes on a Stealth roll for one swarm point each.
1+ points: When the Lunar attacks an enemy within close range of a duplicate, she can add up to (Essence) dice of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage for one swarm point each.
2 points: A duplicate enhanced with Ant-and-Starfish Trick takes a reflexive defend other action.
2 points: A duplicate enhanced with Ant-and-Starfish Trick makes a reflexive distract gambit.
3 points: The Lunar uses Cunning Anglerfish Decoy reflexively. Its cost is waived for the scene (including the surcharge for Ant-and-Starfish Trick), but once the scene ends, the Lunar must pay the cost to maintain the duplicate.
If the Lunar wins the battle with 4+ swarm points remaining, she gains one Willpower.

## Protean 
If the Lunar is in the same shape as an animal duplicate, the die she adds for it is non-Charm.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size may learn this as a Manipulation or Wits Charm.
