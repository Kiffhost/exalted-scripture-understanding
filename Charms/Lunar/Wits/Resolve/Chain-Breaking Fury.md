*As the Lunar realizes how she’s been deceived or used, a terrible wrath fills her heart.*
To use this Charm, she must be obeying a character’s successful influence roll or a Psyche effect, which she can’t have resisted with [[Willpower]]. If this brings her into conflict with a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] or her [[Intimacy|Tie]] to her Solar mate, she enters a second [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], affording her another chance to resist. The strength of the [[Intimacy]] she must invoke, the [[Willpower]] cost, and any additional conditions of the [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] are the same as in the first [[Decision Points|Decision Point]]. If she resists, she instantly forms a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of rage toward the character that influenced her. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Defining [[Intimacy]] that opposes the rejected influence. Upholding a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her Solar mate qualifies even if it isn’t Defining.
