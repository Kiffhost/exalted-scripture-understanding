*The Abyssal adorns herself with blades, dazzling her soon-to-be victims.*
The Abyssal conceals a [[Thrown]] weapon on her person, wearing it as an accessory, incorporating it into her outfit. If she knows [[Improvised Assassin’s Trick]], this can be used on any object she could throw.
Onlookers won’t recognize it as a weapon, even if it’s still freshly bloodied. This Charm ends if she readies the weapon or takes other overtly hostile action.
The Abyssal can stack this Charm to conceal multiple weapons.
