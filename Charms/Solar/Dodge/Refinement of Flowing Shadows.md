The Exalt becomes one with the nothingness and is reborn. Upon using Seven Shadow Evasion to dodge an attack, the Solar gains a point of bonus Initiative, as well as one extra point of Initiative on her turn, each round until she is struck by a withering or decisive attack. This bonus is cancelled if the Solar enters concealment or is at long or extreme long range from her closest foe.
