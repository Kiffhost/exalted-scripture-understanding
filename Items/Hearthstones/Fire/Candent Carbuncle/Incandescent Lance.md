Drawing on the geomantic power seething in the hearthstone, the Exalt sets her [[Essence]] ablaze and hurls it at a foe. This may take the form of a searing fireball or a roaring plume of flame, as desired. The character makes a ([[Dexterity]] + [Brawl or Martial Arts])-based unarmed attack at a target out to short range, with the benefits of [[Burning Coal Fist]] attached.
