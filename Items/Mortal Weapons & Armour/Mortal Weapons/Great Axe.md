These fearsome long-hafted weapons are typically used for striking downward or for wide, sweeping blows. The great axe is a narrow-bladed axe designed for use in both hands, and it is a favorite weapon of the Realm’s heavy infantry, which uses them during sieges and assaults.
Scythes are thick, curved blades attached to a long handle, used by farmers for cutting swathes of grain—and occasionally employed on the battlefield to do the same to troops.
