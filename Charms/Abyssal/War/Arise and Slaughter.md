*Speaking with calm and unquestionable authority, Death’s Lawgiver stirs the corpses of the battlefield to take up arms in her name.*
The Abyssal can use a rally for numbers action to restore Magnitude to a mindless undead battle group despite its perfect morale, adding ([[Essence]]) successes and ignoring the once-per-scene limitation on that action.
If there are not any allied zombie battle groups, the Abyssal can instead animate a [[Size]] 1 battle group of zombies (Exalted, p. 502) with poor [[Drill]] and [[Might]] 1 as long as she rolls a single success. With 5+ successes and sufficient corpses to draw from, she instead reanimates a [[Size]] 2 zombie battle group.
The deathknight draws her new recruits from corpses strewn across the battlefield, and there must be a sufficient supply of them for her to use this Charm. This requirement is generally satisfied in any combat where a battle group has suffered Magnitude damage, but the [[Storyteller]] may require the Abyssal and her allies to kill additional victims before she can use this Charm if he deems there aren’t enough available.
