*The Abyssal’s prowess exceeds that of artisans fettered by mortal lifespans, a master of countless crafts.*
When the Abyssal learns this Charm, each dot she has in a Craft Ability grants her an additional dot that she may place in another Craft Ability with a lower or equal rating. Likewise, each Craft dot the Abyssal purchases with experience grants another dot that can be assigned to a Craft with an equal or lower rating.
For example, an Abyssal with Craft (Blacksmithing) 3 and Craft (Brewing) 1 would receive four extra Craft dots when she learns this Charm. If she raises Blacksmithing to 4 later, she’d gain another Craft dot.
