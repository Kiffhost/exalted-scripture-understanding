## [[Soul extraction via seduction]]
When the sorcerer seduces and sleeps with a willing mortal, she may choose to draw the soul out of his body, leaving it an inanimate husk that soon dies of deprivation. The extracted soul lingers invisibly around her, tethered to her by umbral chains. As a miscellaneous action, the sorcerer may offer up one of her bound souls to Mara in exchange for power once per scene, rolling ([[Essence]] + [[Willpower]]) and gaining that many sorcerous motes. She retains these motes until the end of the scene, and may spend them towards any spells she casts. Additionally, a bound soul may be reflexively expended in place of a point of [[Willpower]] when paying the cost of the sorcererâ€™s control spell. She cannot have more than ([[Essence]] + [[Occult]]) souls bound to her at one time.
