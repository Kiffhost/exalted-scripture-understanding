*The Lunar sculpts flesh like clay, reshaping her patient’s body by hand.*
She rerolls 1s on a [[Medicine]] roll to perform surgery (including Bone-Mending Technique’s roll) and ignores penalties for lacking tools. Surgery time is drastically reduced, letting her complete an hour’s worth of work in one minute. Surgeries enhanced by [[Flesh-Sculpting Art]] never cause damage, no matter how intrusive. Additionally, the Lunar may perform surgeries beyond mundane medicine’s limits in the Age of Sorrows — making cosmetic alterations to a patient’s body, hollowing out pouches of flesh to smuggle contraband or sealing them up, etc. She can’t grant mutations.
