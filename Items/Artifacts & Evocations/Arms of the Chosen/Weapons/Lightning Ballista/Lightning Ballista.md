Lightning ballistae were among the foremost siege weapons of the First Age, great engines of brass and silver with inner workings of intricately wrought orichalcum and blue jade. When fired, the ballista releases a powerful blast of lightning that sears and scorches whatever it hits, turning flesh and wood to ash and melting steel or stone.

In order to operate the engine, it must be powered by a hearthstone; a few enterprising sorcerers have circumvented this, such as by binding willing air elementals into a ballista. A hearthstone powering the weapon doesn’t provide increased mote recovery to its master, although it still provides its other effects.
