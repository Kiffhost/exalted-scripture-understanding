Sometimes, a sorcerer might lose access to her Means mid-working. A cooperating sorcerer has a change of heart and ends his collaboration; the sorcererâ€™s laboratory is raided and razed by her enemies; a pressing issue denies the sorcerer the luxury of taking her time, forcing her to change the interval of her rolls from months to weeks. Losing Means obviously denies the sorcerer the extra rolls they also grant, but also counts as a botch to complicate the final result of the working, representing the complications of adapting to the loss of the resource. 

If the sorcerer has already completed the base five intervals, and is working on the extra intervals granted by one of her Means when it is lost, then her working is placed in dire jeopardy. She is allowed to finish the last interval, but cuts the number of threshold successes she receives in half (rounded up). If this is not enough to finish the working, then it has failed.
