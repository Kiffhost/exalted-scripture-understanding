*Hundreds of nearly invisible threads spit from the stylist’s hands, whipping around physical and spiritual leverage points to weave the world into her web.*
The stylist may pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Rain of Unseen Threads to weave a web extending out to short range. At the start of each of her turns, it extends another range band outward, to a maximum of four range bands. The web has the following effects: 
- The stylist’s enemies treat the web as difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199). Its −3 penalty applies on all physical actions rolled while in the web. 
- The stylist receives heavy cover (Exalted, p. 199) from her web. Once her web reaches long range, it affords full cover against enemies at long range or further. This cover extends to any character she protects with a defend other action. 
- While in the web, the stylist waives the mote cost to create threads with Rain of Unseen Threads.
An enemy can clear their location of webbing with a difficulty 7 feat of strength that requires Strength 3, or a difficulty 4 gambit using a cutting weapon, firewand, or the like, rolled against Defense (stylist’s Essence). However, the damaged web regrows on the stylist’s next turn unless she’s crashed.
If the stylist moves from her location, the built-up webbing fades away, and a new web forms out to short range at the end of her movement. Otherwise, it continues to build, filling the air with strands of cobweb that eventually grow into an opaque forest of webbing surrounding the stylist, thick as stone. 
## Enlightenment
Once per session, the stylist may pay three levels of anima when she uses this Charm to have her web initially form out to long range. It can grow out to a maximum of two bands of extreme range. Spiders of anima scuttle through the web; their radiance extends the web’s difficult terrain penalty to enemies’ Stealth rolls.
