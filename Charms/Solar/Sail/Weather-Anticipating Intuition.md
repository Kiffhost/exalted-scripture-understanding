*The Solarâ€™s [[Essence]] is tied to the waves.*
Through this bond, the water speaks. By touching a body of water, the Solar can see through its eyes, and may predict the weather along her course of travel for the next ([[Essence]] * 10) hours. The only thing that will cause this forecast to err is the influence of powerful weather-changing magic. The Exalt may foresee even freak squalls and unexpected fogs.
