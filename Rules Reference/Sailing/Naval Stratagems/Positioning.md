The ship attempts to maneuver itself into a more favorable position to harm its adversary, whether by ramming them, raking them with arrows, boarding them, or whatever other tactic the captain has in mind. For each success by which the player exceeds her opponentâ€™s Naval Maneuver roll, she gains one point of Momentum.
