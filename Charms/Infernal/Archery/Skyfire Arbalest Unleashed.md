*The Infernal mimes drawing a weapon, hellfire coalescing in her hands.*

The Infernal creates an artifact Archery weapon. The type of weapon and its exact appearance are the same each time she uses this Charm. Her decisive attacks deal aggravated damage. If she uses Endless Hellfire Quiver and stunts a decisive attack with an arrow that exploits an enemy's vulnerabilities, she doubles up to (Essence) 10s on the damage roll.
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively upon entering Devil-Body, waiving its mote cost. If she has an Archery-based Enhanced Attack (p. XX), she can merge the weapon with it, using the better of their traits.
### Keys Thousand Wicked Arrows
The Infernal awakens an Evocation for her weapon. Its themes and functions derive from the Infernal's personality, Caste, iconic anima banner, and any Yozis that she feels a strong affinity for. This key can be purchased any number of times.
