*In the Age of Sorrows, there has been only war between the Dragon-Blooded host and the [[Lunar Exalted]], but it was not always so.*
This Charm is a secret that might have been, and may yet be. The Dragon-Blood must spend this Charm’s training time interacting with a willing Lunar who she has a positive Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward, and who has a positive Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her. Their interactions culminate as the Charm is learned, creating a Terrestrial Bond between the Dragon-Blood and the Lunar. The Dragon-Blood treats the Lunar as one of her Sworn Kin for all purposes. This effect doesn’t extend to the Dragon-Blood’s Hearth, if she has one; the Terrestrial Bond is a separate affinity. Her [[Intimacy|Tie]] for the Lunar is permanently protected as per this Charm’s prerequisite.
The Lunar gains the ability to sense the Dragon-Blood, as usual for Sworn Kin (Dragon-Blooded, p. 154), and treats her as a Solar mate for all purposes. If her [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward him is ever fully eroded, she immediately forms a new Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward him after the scene’s end. A Lunar can only have one Terrestrial mate at a time, and vice versa, and this bond can be broken only by death.
