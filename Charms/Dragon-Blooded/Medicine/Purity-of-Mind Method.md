The Dragon-Blood may treat afflictions of the mind with insightful counseling, guided meditation, soothing hypnosis, or other beneficial methodologies, granting her patient the serenity of still air and the crystalline clarity of ice. Once she’s diagnosed a [[Derangement]], she may treat it with an extended ([Charisma or Intelligence] + [[Medicine]]) roll with difficulty 5, goal number (5 + [intensity x5]), terminus (10 − intensity), and an interval of one month (Exalted, p. 189). She must pay one [[Willpower]] at each interval before rolling. Successfully completing the extended action reduces the Derangement’s intensity by one step, to a minimum of Minor, and grants one [[Willpower]] to both the Dragon-Blood and her patient. While under the effects of this Charm, the patient adds (the Dragon-Blood’s [[Essence]]) bonus dice on [[Willpower]] rolls to resist the treated [[Derangement]], and reduces any [[Resolve]] penalties it imposes by one. Although this Charm can’t reduce Derangements below Minor intensity, the Dragon-Blood may use it to treat a patient’s Minor [[Derangement]], rolling ([Charisma or Intelligence] + [[Medicine]]) roll at difficulty 5 to grant her patient these benefits for one month. She doesn’t need to spend [[Willpower]] or commit this Charm’s mote cost when using it in this fashion.
