ASolarwiththistechniquewriteswithsuperhumanspeed. The Exalt pens brief social influence or short communiquéswithincrediblespeed—shecanwriteafull-pageletter in just seconds, while shorter missives may be constructed almostinstantly.Shecanalsoquicklycopymassivevolumes of information. This Charm does not allow her to produce new work longer than a few pages, but she may flawlessly copy a written work of any length as she reads it, writing quickly enough that she may copy a large book in a single day, or prepare a document that would take hours to transcribe in a matter of minutes. The Solar can even perfectly transcribe a rapid conversation between multiple parties. The Solar may also quickly copy maps—though this Charm lends nothing to her artistic ability, she is able to convey all the information the original conveys, such that one could be substituted for the other, in function if not in form. This Charm does not destroy quills from writing too fast, but writing instruments do wear down at the regular speed, and the Solar’s writing consumes the normal amount of ink. As this Charm entails a dramatic action in which the Solar copies a work, the duration of the effect varies. In a scene where the Solar has used Whirling Brush Method, additional activation costs only one mote.
