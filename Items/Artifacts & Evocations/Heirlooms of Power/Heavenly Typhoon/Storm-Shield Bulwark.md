*The Exalt draws a line with the keen edge of [[Heavenly Typhoon]] and creates a stormy boundary no creature of darkness can cross.*
This Evocation upgrades [[Seed and Salt Warding]] (p. 230). The Dragon-Blood may use it as an Air-aspected Charm to create a line of rippling air pressure that affects condemned characters as well as the undead. 
## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens at no cost when a Dragon-Blooded Ledaal scion attunes [[Heavenly Typhoon]].
