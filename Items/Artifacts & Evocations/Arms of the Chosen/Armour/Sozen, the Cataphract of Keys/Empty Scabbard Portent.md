This Evocation permanently upgrades its prerequisite. 
When the wearer successfully dodges an attack using [[Evanescent Omen Body]] at [[Initiative]] 10+, she may spend four motes to counterattack with a disarm gambit rolled with ([[Dexterity]] + [[Larceny]]). If successful, the weapon dissolves with her into the ominous manifestations. The wearer may choose to have it reappear in her hand or anywhere that [[Evanescent Omen Body]] would allow her to reform; if it’s nonmagical, she may instead leave it dispersed among dapple and shade, gone forever. If she knows [[Summoning the Loyal Steel]] (Exalted, p. 347), she may instead banish a mundane weapon Elsewhere, and recall it with a use of that Charm.
