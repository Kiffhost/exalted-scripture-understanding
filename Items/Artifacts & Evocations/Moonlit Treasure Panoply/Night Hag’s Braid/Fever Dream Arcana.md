*A fearsome witch-weapon, the [[Night Hag’s Braid]] channels its wielder’s sorcerous power.*
The Lunar can pay a two-[[Initiative]] surcharge when she uses [[Shadow-Hands Invocation]] (Lunars, p. 216) to flurry a [[Shape Sorcery]] action with an attack.
With Shadow-Hands Invocation’s repurchase, the Lunar may pay a four-[[Initiative]] surcharge to extend this benefit to the scene-long version of the Charm.
## Resonant
The [[Initiative]] cost is waived if the Lunar flurries a [[Shape Sorcery]] action with a distract or disarm gambit. This lets her use this effect while crashed. It isn’t compatible with the scene-long version of [[Shadow-Hands Invocation]].
