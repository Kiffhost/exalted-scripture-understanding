*Those aboard the Abyssal’s dread flagship can feel her eerie presence in every creaking timber and flickering shadow.*
The Abyssal claims the ship she’s aboard as her own, permanently bonding to it. She can’t claim a ship that belongs to another Exalt. Other characters aboard the ship count as having a Minor Tie of fear towards her.
If the Abyssal formally welcomes someone aboard the ship, she may change this to a Tie of respect or choose not to impose a Tie — but she can rescind this and revert to a Tie of fear at any time.
Additionally, anyone aboard the ship with such a Tie increases its Resolve penalty by −1 and suffers a −1 penalty on rolls that go against that Intimacy. (This includes genuine Ties as well as the Intimacies imposed by this Charm.) If the Intimacy is Major or Defining, the penalty on rolls increases to −2. Those welcomed aboard ship by the Abyssal don’t suffer this penalty, but she can freely revoke this permission.
