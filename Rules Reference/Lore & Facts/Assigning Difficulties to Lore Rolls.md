# TLDR
Plot-critical information should be difficulty 1-4. 
Exciting and challenging information difficulty 5-7.
The greatest secrets of Creation's history difficulty 8-10+.

Facts which are *less thrilling* should be *easier* to [[Introducing a Fact|introduce]].
Facts *more applicable* to the character's [[Lore#Background]] or [[Specialty|Specialties]] should be *easier* to [[Introducing a Fact|introduce]].

“What can a character know?” has been a tetchy question since Gary Gygax had the floor. There are too many factors involved to come up with a pat mechanic to quickly encapsulate where exact difficulties should sit. After all, one might contend that, in a world where the Sidereals can alter the very course of history, it is nearly impossible to say exactly what is true. 

In Exalted, difficulty on Lore rolls should be based on two things, primarily: 
• How thrilling is it if the character knows this fact or understands this thing, solves this riddle or answers this question? If it doesn’t really matter, but it is within the realm of possibility, you probably shouldn’t even roll. 
• How applicable is the character’s knowledge? If their knowledge of a culture comes from a dusty tome written a century ago, their knowledge of that culture today is going to be severely hampered. 

A player character’s [[Lore#background]]—the subject their Lore rating primarily reflects—and their specialties should generally reflect information that is as accurate as possible. In most cases, if the character is challenging a difficulty that falls under her expertise, it is her expertise that makes the roll possible in the first place. If it is interesting to the Storyteller to use a difficult roll to demonstrate to a character how her knowledge might be inaccurate, flawed, biased, or in need of an update, then the Storyteller should raise the difficulty, and use it as a way of leading the character to better, more accurate information, that ultimately updates or corrects the character’s knowledge without experience cost. 

All in all, the difficulty settings should slide up and down based on what is dramatically appropriate. The Storyteller should not expect to get the difficulties perfectly right the first time; learning how to gauge them is just a matter of experience. Lore difficulties should not be consistent, as if run off a chart of values, because there isn’t a consistent base line for truth. In general, however, a crucial fact that forwards the plot should be revealed at difficulty 1-4; at 5-7 difficulties should be reserved for challenges to the greatest minds and should be used to excite players to rise to the occasion, while Lore 8-10+ challenges should be the proving grounds of Solar masters, riddles which unlock or reveal the greatest secrets of Creation’s history. Note again that it is the character’s Lore background and specialty that makes such rolls possible; characters with inaccurate knowledge or different backgrounds experience much greater difficulties, if they are allowed to roll at all.
