*Sirrush all but leaps into its wielder’s hand when danger looms.*
On the first round of combat, she may treat her [[Initiative]] as ([[Wits]]) higher than it actually is to determine when she acts in the round, but must use her turn to make an attack. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder wins [[Join Battle]] against at least one non-trivial foe.
