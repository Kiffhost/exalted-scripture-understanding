*The Infernal vanishes into her inner world, exploring the depths of her soul.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after a scene spent meditating to enter her inner world physically. She can use this Charm a second time to return, appearing in the same place she left. Within her inner world, she adds (higher of Essence or 3) automatic successes on rolls to introduce facts about it.

Other characters detect a trace of the Infernal’s presence where she left with a difficulty 7 (Perception + {Awareness, Investigation, Occult, or Survival}) roll. They can wait for her to return, or use magic like [[Shattered Gates of Heaven]] (p. XX) to intrude on the inner world. A character stranded in the inner world can find a way back with a difficulty 5 (Attribute + Ability) roll that fits his attempted escape. If he fails, he must spend another hour seeking escape before he can roll again.

If the Infernal has created her own demonic souls, they may choose to come with her when she enters her inner world. They can use [[Hurry Home]] to return to it even if the Infernal isn’t there.
## [[Keys]]
#### Soul-Haven Invocation (Essence 3) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she enters her inner world to briefly tear open a portal that blurs the boundaries between worlds, letting up to (Essence x2) willing characters accompany her.
#### Embrace of Hellish Paradise (Essence 4, [[#Soul-Haven Invocation (Essence 3) (+1wp)|Soul-Haven Invocation]]) (+10m)
The Infernal can pay an additional ten-mote surcharge when she uses [[#Soul-Haven Invocation (Essence 3) (+1wp)|Soul-Haven Invocation]] to bring a number of characters equivalent to a Size (Essence) battle group with her (Exalted, p. 206).
