The Enlightening Abnegation Sabers are an exercise in minimalism. Their hooks are made of starmetal hammered into fine wire; their ornate basket hilts of black jade filigree resemble rapiers more than hook swords. They were forged by Akiyo Majenda, who sought to win the heart of Spring Without Sparrows, a Sidereal who’d instructed her at Versino, predecessor to the modern Heptagram. Overcome with passion, Majenda nearly bankrupted her household acquiring the scarce quantity of starmetal necessary, but the result was a masterpiece, harnessing starmetal’s affinity for ephemeral and esoteric forces to create daiklaves capable of disarming foes of more than just their weapons. Then one morning, Majenda woke up with no memory of Spring Without Sparrows and no idea why she’d forged the daiklaves. She nonetheless found good use for them, most famously in the Wyld Hunt against Hedelshi of the Hands, the anathematic Chosen of Avarice. Upon Majenda’s death, Heaven sent a Sidereal to discreetly retrieve the blades. By chance, Spring Without Sparrows was chosen for the task, though she’d since forgotten her long-ago student. The Scarlet Dynasty wondered over the strange daiklaves’ disappearance, but with House Akiyo’s fall and the passage of centuries, they’ve been reduced to a historical footnote.
