*Casting forth shadows of a thousand possible futures, the Sidereal conceals the truths of her existence from another.*
The Sidereal rolls (Manipulation + Stealth) against the Resolve of a character within medium range. If she succeeds, that character can’t focus on any specific details about her, though he can still perceive her location and actions. This prevents him from noticing her appearance, hearing anything she says, and identifying her as a Sidereal, or even as a human.
The affected character also suffers a −3 penalty on rolls targeting only the Sidereal, and −1 Defense and Guile against her.
Special activation rolls: This Charm can be flurried with Stealth rolls.
