The Lunar can scent the changing of the winds and hear the unhearable sounds that presage storms. She rolls (Perception + [Awareness, Investigation, or Survival]) to predict the weather in her current location, forecasting a single hour ahead for each success rolled. She can’t predict the results of weather-changing magic. With Perception 3, Essence 2, when the Storyteller describes a non-magical change in the weather, the Lunar may roll (Perception + [Awareness, Investigation, or Survival]) to introduce a fact about a preparation or contingency she’s made in anticipation of this change. The Storyteller should set the difficulty of the roll based on how plausible the preparation is and how significant an advantage it’ll confer.
