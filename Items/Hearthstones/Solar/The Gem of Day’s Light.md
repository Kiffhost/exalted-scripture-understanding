This Solar hearthstone is a yellow gem burning with an inner light. It allows the Exalt who owns it to travel confidently, knowing that the light of the Unconquered Sun will be with her. She has only to concentrate on the gem to make it glow like a miniature sun, illuminating everything within up to a mileâ€™s radius with the light of day. The Exalt can determine how far the effect stretches by concentrating on the gem. The effect lasts for as long as needed.
Concentrating to activate the effect is a miscellaneous action, though it can be ended reflexively. Hungry ghosts react to this light as they do to the actual sun.
