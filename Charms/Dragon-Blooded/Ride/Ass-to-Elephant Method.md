A humble draft horse can haul massive boulders behind it when ridden by a Prince of the Earth. This Charm supplements a feat of strength by a mount being ridden by the Dragon-Blood, adding its Speed bonus to its Strength. This both increases its dice pool and its effective Strength rating for determining what feats it may attempt (Exalted, p. 231).
