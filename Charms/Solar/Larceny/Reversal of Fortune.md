*Stealing from the Lawgiver is a risky proposition at best.*
With this Charm, the Exalt gains two automatic successes to an [[Awareness]] roll to detect any attempt to pickpocket from her person. Upon successfully noticing an attempted theft with this Charm, the theft is not only thwarted, but the thief is left open to reprisal. If the thief is close enough to touch, the Lawgiver becomes aware of every object on his person that may be stolen (as per the rules of pickpocketing on page 224) and can attempt to steal one of these objects with all of the same advantages as [[Flawless Pickpocketing Technique]].
