Striking with overwhelming intensity, the Immaculate burns through her foeâ€™s defense. She doubles (Essence) 9s on a decisive attack roll against an enemy with lower Initiative. She doubles 8s against crashed foes, though still up to a total of (Essence) doubled successes. In Fire Aura, each success doubled by this Charm also adds one die of damage.
