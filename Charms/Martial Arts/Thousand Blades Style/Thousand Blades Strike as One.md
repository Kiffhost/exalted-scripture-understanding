*Blade after blade flies at the stylist’s foe, pinning him down beneath a deadly barrage.*
The stylist makes a withering or decisive attack, adding (Arsenal) dice on both the attack and damage rolls. She adds (Arsenal/2, rounded up) to the attack’s onslaught penalty.
## Mastery
This Charm is Supplemental, enhancing attacks rather than creating them.
## Terrestrial
A withering attack adds (Arsenal) raw damage rather than damage dice, while a decisive attack instead adds up to (Arsenal) extra successes as damage dice.
