Moonlit Sentinel Vigilance, Watchful Spider Stance (x2) The Lunar is an ever-watchful guardian, appearing just in time to defend those closest to her heart.
This Charm represents the Lunar’s legendary prowess as a guardian and her foresight in anticipating danger. Whenever her Lunar’s Solar mate or someone she has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward comes under meaningful threat of harm, the Lunar’s player may declare that she’s present in the scene, revealing that she’s secretly been following that character to protect him. The details of her appearance are up to the Storyteller, but should guarantee she’s in a position to protect her ward. She can’t use this Charm to gain a tactical advantage over a ward, only to aid him.
Upon arriving, the Lunar rolls (Perception + Awareness), gaining both Initiative equal to her successes and a pool of motes equal to twice her successes that can only be spent on Charms that let her protect the other character, such as Ferocious Guardian Beast Stance or PackPreserving Instinct.
If the Storyteller finds it implausible for the Lunar to appear in a scene — for example, if her ward’s been locked in a cell for solitary confinement — he may set a difficulty, maximum 10, that the Lunar must beat with her roll for this Charm to succeed. Sneaking past a Realm military camp’s guards to protect someone being held prisoner within might be difficulty 2-4, depending on the quality of the troops posted, while appearing to someone being held in Heaven’s Jade Pleasure Dome or someone imprisoned within a sorcerously sealed artifact sarcophagus at the bottom of the sea might be difficulty 10 (“it turns out I was a flea in your hair all along!”) 
## Reset 
Once per story, unless reset by upholding a positive Major or Defining Tie or a Tie to her Solar mate by protecting that character from danger that is both narratively relevant and perilous enough to challenge even the Exalted.
