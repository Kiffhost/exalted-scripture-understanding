*The stylist’s limbs twist and coil like crawling centipedes, grasping her foes in inescapable holds or wriggling out of their clutches.*
She can activate this Charm after landing a grapple gambit or being hit by an enemy’s grapple, but before the control roll. She rolls a non-Charm die for each 10 on her control roll or roll opposing the opponent’s control roll, while her enemy’s 1s subtract successes from his roll. 
If the stylist successfully opposes an enemy’s control roll, she may pay one bashing health level to employ the technique called **The Ninety-Nine More**. She dislocates a grabbed limb to gain leverage over her attacker, reflexively making a grapple gambit against him. Extra successes on her roll opposing his control roll are added as bonus dice to her attack and control roll. 
## Terrestrial
The stylist can’t use The Ninety-Nine More.
