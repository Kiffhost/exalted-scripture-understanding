Stemming the tide of her opponentsâ€™ forces, the Lunar reveals hidden defenses. When an allied battle group makes a rout check, she adds up to (its [[Size]] + [[Might]]) dice on the roll for one [[Initiative]] per die. If successful, the battle group also gains +1 [[Defense]] and +([[Initiative]] spent) soak until the end of its next turn. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm.
