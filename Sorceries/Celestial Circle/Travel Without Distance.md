*The sorcerer shapes a blazing corona of [[Essence]] around herself through mudras that describe the warp and weft of space.*
As she completes the spell, she is engulfed in whirling clouds of [[Essence]] and energy, and then is gone. She may reappear in any location within (Essence x 10) miles, as long as she has seen it before, either first-hand or through scrying magics. She appears in a safe location at the chosen duration in a swirling vortex of light sure to impress the locals. 
[[Travel Without Distance]] is mildly disorientingâ€”the sorcerer suffers a -2 fatigue penalty on all actions for (6 - [[Stamina]]) hours afterwards, and cannot cast it again until this penalty has run its course. This spell is highly valued by both the Sidereal and [[Lunar Exalted]], who maintain hidden meeting-places that can only be reached with this spell. 
A sorcerer who knows [[Travel Without Distance]] as her control spell may bring up to ([[Essence]] + 1) willing characters within short range along with her when she casts this spell. All transported characters suffer the fatigue penalty from disorientation.
