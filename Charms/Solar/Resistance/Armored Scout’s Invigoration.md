The Solar slides into her armor like it was second skin, [[Essence]] smoothing the way. The Exalt invokes this Charm when she equips her armor. So long as she wears her armor, its mobility is treated as if it were 0, removing the penalty to her movement, [[Stealth]] actions, and [[Defense|Evasion]]. If the Exalt is wearing light or medium armor, this Charm costs four motes. If she is wearing heavy armor, it costs six motes. If her armorâ€™s mobility is already 0, she can reroll a single non-successful die on her [[Join Battle]] roll.
