*This relic was forged for the legendary Dragon-Blooded warrior Eldra at the dawn of the First Age.*
Most of her exploits are lost to time. But even today, Realm musicians sing of her blazing charge against the Shadow-Riders of Wan, whose unwholesome steeds shied from her approach. Others tell of her crossing the Burning Sands to petition the Swan Dragon’s aid, traversing the Pole of Fire itself unscathed. Forged of overlapping red jade plates bare of ornamentation, [[Carnelian Phoenix]] itself tells no tale of its origins. This barding functions as medium artifact armor for an equipped steed. Its rider must commit six motes to attune it, making it light as a feather for any mount that wears it. 
 Evocation. Prostheses that incorporate moonsilver or particularly sophisticated designs can resize themselves. Most, however, are bespoke, fitting only the person they’re made for, as differences in body size and shape and the extent of each injury must be taken into consideration. Refitting a prosthesis to a new user is a superior repair project (Exalted, p. 241). Lunar shapeshifters most often use moonsilver prostheses, which naturally change shape to match whatever form they take. Other prostheses are incompatible with non-human forms and vanish into Elsewhere, unless they have a power or Evocation that lets them shift with their master, as [[Arete]] does. Black and green jade often possess this property. 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Carnelian Phoenix]]

The mount wearing [[Carnelian Phoenix]] suffers no deleterious effects from extreme climates, whether frozen tundra or broiling desert. [[Charms]] that protect the rider from environmental damage, such as [[Element-Resisting Prana]], extend their effects to the mount.
