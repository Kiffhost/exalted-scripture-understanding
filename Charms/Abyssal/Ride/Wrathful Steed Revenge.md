*Slavering for the flesh of the fallen, the deathknight’s mount turns its hunger on those who would strike its rider.*
While riding a mount rolled into battle with FleshEating Steed Frenzy, the Abyssal may have it makes a decisive counterattack against an enemy who attacks either it or the deathknight.
With an Essence 3 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to have her mount make a clash attack instead.
