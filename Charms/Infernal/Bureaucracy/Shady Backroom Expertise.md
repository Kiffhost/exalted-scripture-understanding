*The Infernal knows shady dealings and corrupt bargains as if she were in the room where they happened.*

The Infernal adds (Manipulation/2, rounded up) dice on a read intentions or profile character roll. Her target suffers −2 Guile if it would reveal any corruption or misuse of power on his part within an organization, any moral transgression he’s committed as part of that organization, or any of his regrets, shames, or fears related to the organization or his role in it.

If the Infernal succeeds and uses the discovered information as part of a Bureaucracy roll, she adds (Manipulation/2, rounded up) dice. She can also add this bonus on an influence roll against the targeted character. She can only apply this bonus on a single roll, and loses it if she doesn’t use it by the end of the scene.
### Keys
