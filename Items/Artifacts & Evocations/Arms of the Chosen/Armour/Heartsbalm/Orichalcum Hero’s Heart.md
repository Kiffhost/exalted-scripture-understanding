A tide of power arises from [[Heartsbalm]] as its wearer withstands trials and tribulations for her love, born from resonance between the wearer’s compassion and that of every hero to have ever worn the armor. This force rebukes enemies, turning their own attacks back on them. The wearer can only use this Evocation while she is fighting to protect her beloved or their relationship. After being hit by a decisive attack, she may roll (her current temporary [[Willpower]] + [[Intimacy]] for her beloved), opposing the damage roll. If her roll wins, she takes no harm from the attack, and her attacker resets to base [[Initiative]] normally. This Evocation can only be used once per day, unless reset by risking harm to uphold a [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards one’s beloved. 

## Resonant

The wielder may redirect a negated attack back on the character who made it, forcing him to roll damage against himself if his attack roll beats his [[Defense]].
