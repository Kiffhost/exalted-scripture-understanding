*The Lunar’s lungs swell as she draws in a tremendous breath.*
She inhales any vapors (except air) within medium range, even magical ones. She could clear dense fog, draw smoke from a burning building, or breathe in poisonous gas before it harms her allies. She suffers the usual effects of inhaled poisons or dangerous substances, rolling to resist them normally. With [[Stamina]] 4, [[Essence]] 2, when a Lunar using this Charm rolls enough successes to completely negate the duration of an inhaled poison or otherwise completely avoid harm from a hazardous substance she’s inhaled, !!shemayexhaleitatanenemywithinmediumrange.This!! is an unblockable decisive attack rolled with ([[Stamina]] + {Archery or Athletics}), exposing her foe to the substance on a hit. It doesn’t deal damage or reset her [[Initiative]].
