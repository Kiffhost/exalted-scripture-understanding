This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite.
The Solar’s genius inspires her to greater heights, making her aware of patterns and possibilities unforeseen by mortals. For every three of a kind successes (ex: three sevens, three eights, etc.), the player may choose one non-success die and convert it to a 10, adding two successes to the result. If [[Flawless Handiwork Method]] is used, 10s created in this fashion are also rerolled until 10s fail to appear.
