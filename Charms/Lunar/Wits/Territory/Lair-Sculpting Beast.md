*The Lunar’s territory subtly shifts and changes, serving her will and expressing the nature of the monster who lairs there.*
The Lunar makes a special ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) [[Introducing a Fact|introduce fact]] roll, adding ([[Essence]]) non-Charm successes, to reveal a change in her territory’s geography, climate, or other natural features. This typically involves the Lunar revealing or discovering a change that’s already taken place — it can’t create sudden, drastic changes. She could reveal a pass through a perilous mountain range, a natural hot spring in a frozen tundra, or the fact that a dormant volcano has reawakened. This can’t create supernatural phenomena — a river’s course might change to speed the Lunar’s journey, but it won’t turn to liquid flame.
Once per story, the Lunar can use this Charm to change one of her territory’s qualities with a ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) roll. The difficulty depends on how similar the new property is to the one that it replaces: difficulty 3 for similar qualities, difficulty 5 for unrelated qualities, or difficulty 7 for qualities that conflict with each other.
If successful, the territory is transformed to reflect the change in qualities. This change is a slow one, and isn’t completed until the story ends.
