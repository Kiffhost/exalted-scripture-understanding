The victorious general forces the fight to occur somewhere advantageous by dint of its nature—generally this is used by Fair Folk strategoi to force their opponents to pursue them into the bordermarches of the Wyld, or by Abyssal Exalted to force confrontations inside shadowlands. This stratagem offers no mechanical advantage in and of itself—it’s up to the general to have a battle strategy in mind to exploit the ground she’s chosen.
