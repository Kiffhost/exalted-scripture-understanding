*Yellow stardust glitters beneath the Sidereal’s skin, hair, clothes, and eyes as she begins to run, writing her journey into the tapestry of fate.*
So long as the Sidereal continues moving in the direction she set out in, she gains +([[Dexterity]], [[Stamina]], or [[Strength]]) soak and +1 [[Hardness]]. This stacks with [[Hardness]] from magic, but not from armor. She has no need of sleep, ignores fatigue penalties, and adds ([[Essence]]) dice on [[Resistance]] rolls and rolls against [[environmental hazards]]. If the Sidereal rides a mount, it gains these benefits as well. If changing circumstances render the original cause of the Sidereal’s journey irrelevant, she senses this and rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Resistance]]), receiving more information the more successes she receives. This Charm ends if the Sidereal stops moving forward, diverges from her original course by more than ten degrees, looks away from what’s directly in front of her, takes any non-reflexive action other than a movement action, or uses any magic that doesn’t enhance movement action.
