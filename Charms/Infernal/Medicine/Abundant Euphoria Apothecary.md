*The Infernal is a cauldron of potent passions: she weeps tears of pungent liquor, grows herbs amidst her tangled hair, or vomits up clutches of candy-coloured pills.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Medicine) inspire roll with (Essence) non-Charm successes to distill an emotion into a psychedelic drug. It’s exceptional equipment for treating disease, poison, or other ailments as long as someone tells the patient that it will do so (Exalted, p. 580).

A character who ingests the drug is exposed to the Infernal’s inspire roll. If he chooses not to apply his Resolve against it when being treated for an ailment, the treating character adds a non-Charm success on the Medicine roll. If a character administering the drug rolls any 1s, he’s also exposed to the drug’s influence due to careless handling.

Drugs created with this Charm lose their potency after a month, though they remain exceptional equipment.
## [[Keys]]
#### Consumptive Desire Formula (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to create horrifically addictive drugs. A character whose Resolve is beaten gains a Minor Obsession for the Infernal’s drugs and becomes addicted to them (Exalted, pp. 167-169). If he chooses not to apply his Resolve, the bonus on the treatment roll increases to (Infernal’s Essence/2, rounded up) non-Charm successes. The Obsession is broken once he’s spent (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) Willpower resisting it, but the addiction lingers after that until the end of the story. The drug’s addictive potency fades after a day if it’s not consumed, but not this Charm’s other effects.
