*The raksha Maja of the Starling’s Song is still remembered in the [[Silver Pact|Silver Pact]]’s war-chants.*
A relentless warrior, ceaseless in pursuit of perfection, she honed her techniques before her looking glass, correcting even the smallest errors in her attacks. When she led her goblin army against Creation, she swept through foes as if moving through the steps of a dance — no motion wasted, no strike off its mark. In her hubris, she named herself Equal to the Sun, for surely no other could match her. Her downfall came at the hands of a Lunar Circle, still young but steadfast in their camaraderie. Umrita Dal stole into her camp by night and absconded with her fabled looking glass. His sister, Antarin Iron-Wise, reshaped it into a mighty [[Shield]], calling from its silvery depths the memory of Maja’s every mistake. Once completed, the warrior Hundred Thunders bore the shield into battle, confounding the raksha with all her failures and follies. In the end, Maja submitted, all pretense of perfection shattered. Since then, many Lunars have borne [[Penumbra Gleam]]. It’s often given to young Pact members — especially those needing a lesson in humility, for it reveals the flaws of anyone it reflects, especially its wielder. Granting the shield to another is considered either a show of confidence or a rebuke, but it’s served many Lunars well, all of them bettered by it. [[Penumbra Gleam]] is a gently curved pane of unblemished moonsilver polished to a mirror sheen. Strange images sometimes flash across its surface — most of all, Maja’s shadow. 

## [[Evocations]] of [[Penumbra Gleam]] 

Upon attuning to [[Penumbra Gleam]], its wielder awakens [[Meditation in Silver]] for free. Maja’s shadow appears in the shield’s surface, offering a single word of advice: “Strive.”
