The Solar pulls explosive Essence from her extremities, causing them to lance through the point of her strike. Her blow enjoys one automatic success on the attack roll and (Essence) bonus dice to damage. Ox-Stunning Blow can only be soaked with the targetâ€™s Stamina, but unlike a normal withering attack, the Solar does not reap Initiative from damage successes. Rather, any Initiative she strips is rolled again as dice, and for every two success, the target suffers a -1 penalty to his defenses and dice pools until his onslaught penalty wears off. An Essence 3+ repurchase allows the Solar to gain Initiative in addition to penalizing her opponent with rolled successes.
