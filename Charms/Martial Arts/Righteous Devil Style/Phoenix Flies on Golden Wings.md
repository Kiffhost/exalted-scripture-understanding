*A halo of gold and cobalt [[Essence]] rings the tip of the firewand’s barrel as the Righteous Devil sights a foe, sending six golden wings spiraling forward to speed the tongue of flame towards him.*
This Charm boosts the damage of an attack based on the distance it’s made from, adding +4 against an enemy at close range, +3 against an enemy at short range (and so on, if magic is used to extended the range of the attack). This bonus is added as successes on a withering attack or dice on a decisive attack.
