*The deathknight outpaces her enemy with impossible speed, surrounding him with ghostly afterimages that seem to strike from every angle.*
When the Abyssal attacks an enemy at close range whose [[Initiative]] is lower than hers (prior to paying this Charm’s cost), she rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) opposing his ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]). If successful, the attack becomes a surprise attack, imposing a −2 penalty on her victim’s [[Defense]] against the attack.
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]] and then rising to [[Initiative]] 6+.
