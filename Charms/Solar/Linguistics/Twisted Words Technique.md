*Concentrating on the formation of sounds and the weight of certain meanings, the Solar shapes her words like a weapon.*
This Charm is a mental attack disguised as social influence, entailing a written or spoken action made with ([[Manipulation]] + {Linguistics or another relevant Social Ability}). The Solar must target an [[Intimacy]] when using this Charm—exploiting something the character cares about to get him to accept influence. However, upon success, the target will feel overwhelmingly compelled to act in a way that is the opposite of what she agreed to, as if her [[Intimacy]] had been inverted. For example, a Solar convinces an Immaculate priest of the evils of the harlotry in Great Forks, convincing her to shun the temple prostitutes. The priest agrees vehemently, and then goes to live with them. Likewise, a Solar forced to brainwash a Circle member could outwardly torture him, while actually strengthening his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] of love for her and his understanding of why his suffering is necessary. Once successful, persuasion caused by this Charm can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]] until another character successfully dissuades the target from a chosen course of action (p. 221), and upon doing so, the target must pay (Solar’s [[Essence]]) [[Willpower]] to break free. [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] tainted by this Charm are more insidious— they are both harder to root out, but also indecipherable from what a character truly believes. While [[Transcendent Hero’s Meditation]] (p. 308) can shatter persuasion caused by this Charm, it can’t change the Solar’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], though it does make her realize how she’s been influenced. 

## Sidebar
This Charm doesn’t actually invert [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], though it ultimately causes characters to behave as if it did. When used to instill beliefs, this Charm may strengthen or weaken [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] as a normal instill action would. The difference is that it appears to strengthen an [[Intimacy]] when it is actually weakening it, or strengthens an [[Intimacy]] that it appears to weaken.
For example, “You certainly look noble in purple,” convinces someone that he looks like a fool in purple, while “I can’t stand you, you’re insufferable,” only increases his desire to be around you.
Just as a normal [[instill]] action, it may also be used to create contradictory [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], though it appears to create an [[Intimacy]] which agrees. 
For example, one might get a monk with a Defining [[Intimacy]] for the Immaculate [[Order]] to agree that temple harlotry in Great Forks is bad far more easily than one might convince him that it’s good. By using this Charm to convince him that it’s bad, one convinces him to behave as if it’s good, giving him an [[Intimacy]] that, in some way, contradicts his core belief in the Immaculate Faith.
