The Dragon-Blood’s grasp is as sudden and inescapable as the riptide. She makes a grapple gambit, rolling ([[Strength]] + [[Brawl]]) to attack. Bonus dots of [[Strength]] granted by magic such as [[Strength of Stone Technique]] don’t add to her attack roll. Every two threshold successes on her attack roll add a bonus die to the gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll.
