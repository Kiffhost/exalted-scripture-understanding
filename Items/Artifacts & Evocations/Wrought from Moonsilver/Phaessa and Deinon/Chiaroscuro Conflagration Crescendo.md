*When [[Phaessa and Deinon]] waken to their full might, no corner of the battlefield is free of their selenic influence.*
This Evocation can only be used when the swords become waxing or waning by incapacitating or crashing a nontrivial enemy. They gain the following abilities: 
- If this Evocation was used when the swords became waxing, a tower of black and silver flame manifests the Lunar’s terrifying image. She makes a reflexive threaten roll against all opponents who can see her, and may spend levels of anima to enhance this: one level doubles 9s, two levels doubles 8s, and three levels doubles 7s. Each enemy whose [[Resolve]] is beaten loses five [[Initiative]]. While the blades are waxing, opponents whose [[Resolve]] was beaten or who have fear-based Ties toward the Lunar suffer a −3 penalty on attack rolls against her and to [[Defense]] against her attacks. Battle groups suffer a −3 penalty on rout checks caused by her, and don’t add their [[Size]] on attack or damage rolls against her. 
- If this Evocation was used when the swords became waning, a vortex of light and shadow engulfs the Lunar. She reflexively rolls to enter concealment, and may spend levels of anima to enhance this: one level doubles 9s, two levels doubles 8s, and three levels doubles 7s. (Any [[Stealth]] penalties are based on her anima level after spending anima.) While the blades are waning, she ignores penalties to [[Stealth]] rolls; doesn’t need adequate hiding spots unless in wide-open, brightly lit terrain; and increases the [[Defense]] penalty against her unexpected attacks by one. This Evocation can only be used once per scene. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation can’t be awakened with experience points. Instead, it awakens for free when the Lunar performs an agreed-upon task for the moon gods in the swords. They choose a task based on information available to the Lunar, typically a matter of purification, revelation, or mending: cleansing a polluted river, exposing a false prophet, making amends to a wronged rival, etc.

## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by characters resonant with [[Phaessa and Deinon]].
