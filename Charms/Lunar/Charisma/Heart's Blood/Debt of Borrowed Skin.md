The Lunar trades favors for faces. She performs a sacred hunt to claim a human’s shape by performing what she considers a serious or life-defining task (Exalted, p. 210) on his behalf. Her target must have expressly assented to her performing the task and consider it to be equal in value to his heart’s blood (along with any other compensation he provides for the task) at the time he does so, though he needn’t know of or consent to that aspect of the exchange, and can’t later renege on the deal. If the Lunar fails to accomplish the task or abandons it, the sacred hunt fails, and she can’t take her target’s shape through this Charm for the rest of the story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means.
