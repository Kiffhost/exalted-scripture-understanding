*There is no authority that cannot be snatched away. This the Yozis know well.*

The Infernal usurps a character’s authority by stealing an object that represents it, like a guard’s cudgel or a satrap’s diadem. Before she can use this Charm, she must have spent at least a scene dramatically challenging or undermining the character’s authority earlier in the story, either to his face or when speaking publicly to those under his authority. If his position is equivalent to 2+ dots in Backing or Influence rating, the Infernal must spend a full day assailing his authority (Exalted, pp. 159, 162). Higher positions require (Merit rating) consecutive days, or a substantial amount of downtime.

Upon stealing a token of her victim’s authority and using this Charm, the Infernal makes a special (Manipulation + Larceny) instil roll. She can use Charms that enhance pickpocketing on this roll. For the object’s owner, this influence is identical to [[Theft As Release]]. Other characters who encounter the stolen object or its former owner are also exposed to this influence, causing them to believe that the object’s current holder rightfully holds the authority that it represents, and that the former owner has no such claim.

A character can spend one Willpower to resist this Psyche effect for one day if it opposes one of his Major or Defining Intimacies, such a Tie of respect to its victim or a negative Tie toward the stolen object’s recipient. Principles based on respect for law, governments, or other authority don’t count for this. The victim himself doesn’t need an Intimacy to resist. Once a character has done so on (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) days, he’s freed from this effect.

This Charm ends if the victim reclaims the stolen object.
## [[Keys]]
#### Shattered Scepter Petulance
If the Infernal destroys the stolen object, this Charm’s influence causes others to perceive that authority as being wholly invalid, rather than belonging to another. Characters can’t use Ties to the object’s former bearer to support resisting the influence, but can use Principles of respect for law or authority. The victim can escape by this reclaiming and repair the stolen object, or by creating a replacement after dramatically re-establishing his authority through a significant triumph over the Infernal.
