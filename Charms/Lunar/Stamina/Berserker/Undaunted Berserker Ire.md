The Lunarâ€™s warrior spirit is undeterred by honeyed words or trickery. In combat, she may spend five [[Initiative]] instead of one [[Willpower]] when resisting social influence or similar effects. Once per scene, while [[Relentless Lunar Fury]] is active, she may waive one [[Willpower]] of the cost to resist such an effect.
