*A shockwave of [[Essence]] bursts from the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s weapon, casting up smoke and strewing the battlefield with debris.*
A successful decisive attack creates a smoke cloud out to short range from the target, providing sufficient concealment to roll [[Stealth]]. If the Dragon-Blood or any of her allies makes an unexpected attack against the same enemy from within the smoke, they add a bonus die on both the attack and damage roll. The smoke dissipates once this Charm ends. With a [[Thrown]] 5, [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, the Dragon-Blood may pay one [[Willpower]] upon landing an attack while in Fire Aura to reflexively roll ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) to establish concealment within the smoke.
