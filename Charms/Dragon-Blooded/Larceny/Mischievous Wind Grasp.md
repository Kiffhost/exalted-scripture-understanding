The air itself is the Dragon-Blood’s accomplice when she has need of it, rising up in a small breeze directed by deft hand gestures. She directs a subtle current of wind to dislodge an object small enough to hold in one hand from a character within short range, whether it’s stationary or on someone’s person, though not one that a character’s currently using. She could pull a key ring from a jailer’s belt, pluck a sealed letter out of a courtier’s robes, or knock a wineglass off a banquet table. If the item is on someone’s person, the Exalt must roll (Wits + Larceny) opposing his (Perception + Awareness) roll. In combat, this is treated as a ranged disarm gambit. A successful roll dislodges the item, causing it to fall to its owner’s feet. Other characters cannot notice this for up to one minute or (Essence) rounds, whichever comes first, unless circumstances call attention to it, such as trying to draw a displaced blade. Even on a failed roll, onlookers don’t realize the unnatural nature of the wind unless they use magic, though repeated use may stir suspicions. In Air Aura, this Charm’s range is extended to medium.
