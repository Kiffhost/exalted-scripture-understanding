*Moving through the sultry, languid forms of a hypnotic kata, the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan beguiles her enemies with ethereal music and the fragrant scent of flower petals.* 
Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata adds the martial artistâ€™s Essence in bonus successes to an inspire roll made to fill enemies with emotions of love, lust, mercy, distraction, or similar, and suffers no penalties for targeting multiple characters. With appropriate stunting, it may also enhance other types of social actions that align with the hypnotic, seductive nature of this Charm. 
In combat, an enemy whose Resolve is overcome by the influence roll loses a point of Initiative, even if he spends Willpower to resist. The Dreaming Pearl Courtesan gains all Initiative lost this way, up to a maximum of her (Appearance). 
## Special activation rules
Once an enemy has been exposed to the Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata, he is immune to further uses of it for the rest of the scene, regardless of whether he succeeded or failed in resisting it.
