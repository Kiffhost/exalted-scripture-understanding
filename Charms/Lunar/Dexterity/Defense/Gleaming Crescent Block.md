*Spotting the imperfection in a foe’s attack, the Lunar blocks with a perfectly timed parry, creating an opening in her attacker’s guard.*
She may use this Charm after an attack roll against her [[Defense|Parry]], causing ([[Essence]]) 1s to subtract successes. If she uses this Charm with [[Coiled Serpent Strikes]] and successfully parries, she also adds that many dice on the counterattack’s damage roll.
