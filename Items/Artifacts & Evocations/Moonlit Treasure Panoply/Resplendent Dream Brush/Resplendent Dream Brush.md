At the height of his career, Dharma the Snake decried Meru’s art culture, condemning his peers’ work as passionless, trite, and self-glorying. The iconoclastic painter left the city of the Chosen to seek out the company of his true equals. His journey spanned the cosmos, from the subterranean city Urvar’s Jadeborn pattern sculptors to the Brazen Nautilus Collective of neomah flesh-artists in Hell. But it was not until he found the raksha prince Jadan Ruby-Eyes, exiled from the Court of Riverine Stone for his use of heretical colors, that he found his match.
Creative collaborators, fast friends, and sometimes lovers, Dharma and Jadan created works of strange, impossible beauty: artistic arrangements of equations, counter-erotic portraiture, sculptures with spatial dimensions unknown to Creation. Their masterpiece was the [[Resplendent Dream Brush]], a wonder that would let true artists shape the world with their artistic vision.
The brush’s handle is teakwood, taken by Jadan from the Verdant Khamsal’s dreams. Dharma worked in a dream-like trance, shaping the moonsilver of the bristles and of the inscription upon its handle. Written in an obscure fae tongue, the inscription is Jadan’s epitaph:
to complete the [[Resplendent Dream Brush]], he became part of it, the apotheosis of his art.
Dharma was never welcomed back by his peers, nor did he ever care to return. He occasionally traveled Creation, seeking new subjects for his art and enjoying the company of the few he counted as friends. But most of his days were spent among the Fair Folk, having grown accustomed to their mores and their alien ways. When he died, the [[Resplendent Dream Brush]] was bequeathed to the Court of Riverine Stone, that Jadan’s exile might finally be ended. The court’s prince, Kayesa Who-IsDrowning-You, has granted the brush to Lunars who’ve bargained with her in the past, but always requires that it be returned to her in the end. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of

[[Resplendent Dream Brush]] The Resplendent Dream Brush’s [[Evocations]] let the artist paint dreams into reality. It draws from the painter’s passions and Intimacies, imbuing her creations with emotional resonance.
Some of the Resplendent Dream Brush’s [[Evocations]] invoke Intimacies, drawing power from them. This weakens the [[Intimacy]] by one level. Only emotion-based Intimacies can be invoked, and each [[Intimacy]] can only be invoked once per day. In the Wyld, the painter can draw on its chaos instead of invoking Intimacies.
Bordermarches count as Minor Intimacies, middlemarches as Major, and the deep Wyld as Defining.
The brush is exceptional (Exalted, p. 580). It has no need for paint, creating whatever colors the painter requires from her own emotions. Upon attuning to it, the artist awakens [[Painter of Dreams]] for free.
