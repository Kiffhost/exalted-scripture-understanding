The Lunar slows her vital functions, stilling her breathing and heart. She rolls ([Appearance or Stamina] + [Medicine, Resistance, or Stealth]) to feign death, doubling 8s. Wound penalties add non-Charm dice on the roll instead of subtracting. Characters with superhuman or magically enhanced senses can roll (Perception + [Awareness, Investigation, or Medicine]) opposing the Lunar’s successes to realize she’s still alive. Moving, speaking, or taking overt actions spoils this deception, although the Lunar may be able to convince characters that previously failed to see through the false death that she’s undead instead. When the Lunar uses this Charm, she may use Bear Sleep Technique reflexively if she knows it, muting its cost. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape feigns death as a defensive behavior may learn this as an Appearance Charm.
