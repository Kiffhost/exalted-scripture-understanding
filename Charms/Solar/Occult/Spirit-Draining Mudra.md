*The Solar may draw on the [[Essence]] of a creature she has bound into the [[Spirit-Caging Mandala]] to power her [[Occult]] magic.*
Until the bound character is free, the cost of the Exalt’s [[Occult]] [[Charms]] are reduced by the [[Essence]] score of the trapped entity. These motes are taken from the bound character to fuel the Solar’s [[Charms]]. The Solar may also invoke this power each time she takes a shaping action in order to cast a spell.
