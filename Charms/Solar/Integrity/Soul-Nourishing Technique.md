The Solar’s words are bread and water to those who listen. The Solar gives a sermon, recites a parable, or tells a story that explains one of her Defining Principles and why it means so much to her, how it influences her views and what it reveals about Creation. This sermon must last at least an hour. The Solar’s words feed the audience like a nutritious meal and hydrate them like water from a fresh spring. Listening to this sermon grants listeners automatic knowledge of the [[Intimacy|Principle]] being discussed without needing to make a read intentions action.
