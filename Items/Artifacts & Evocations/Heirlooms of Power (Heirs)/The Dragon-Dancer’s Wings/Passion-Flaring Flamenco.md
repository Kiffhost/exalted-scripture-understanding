*The Dragon-Dancer’s [[Wings]] stir the flames in the hearts of the wielder’s audience, rousing them to ardent passions.*
She makes a dance-based ([[Appearance]] + [[Performance]]) inspire roll with (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) bonus dice to rouse desire, anger, excitement, or other active emotions.
In addition to inspiring that emotion, this influence also instills each affected character with a Minor [[Intimacy]] that relates to that emotion, chosen by the character’s player.
If a Dragon-Blood uses [[Falling Leaves Sway]], [[Swaying Boughs Arabesque]], or [[Waltz of Honeyed Wine]] (Dragon-Blooded, pp. 241-242) with this Evocation, such uses are Fire aspected.
