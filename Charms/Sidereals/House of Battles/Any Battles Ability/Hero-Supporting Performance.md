*The Sidereal is as strong as her strongest comrade.*
When the Sidereal makes a Strength-based roll, she rolls twice: once with her own dice pool, and once with the highest dice pool among her allies in the scene. She can’t use magic to enhance the roll with the other character’s dice pool, but he can use his own magic to do so.
