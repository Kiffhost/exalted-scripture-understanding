This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. The Exalt has the eyes of the steeliest raptor. She can spot a field mouse a mile away, read a letter at a hundred yards, and critique the mating habits of insects. In zero visibility environments—such as a silt cloud in the belly of a sunken ship—she sees as if she were in a dense fog, using the rules of Keen Sight Technique. She may pick a face out of a crowd with a casual glance, predict a flash flood by counting distant raindrops, and tell if someone is alive by seeing the blood flow through his skin. 

## Special activation rules

When Keen Sight Technique is active, any sight-based Awareness Charm is reduced in cost by one mote, to a minimum of one. If the character has learned all three Unsurpassed (Sense) Discipline and activates all three Keen (Sense) Techniques, this discount applies to any Awareness Charm.
