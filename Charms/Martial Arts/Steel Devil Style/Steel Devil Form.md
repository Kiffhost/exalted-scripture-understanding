Spinning her blades into an underhand or overhand grip and drawing them in alongside her arms, the Steel Devil coils her body in an attitude of lethal readiness. Assuming this form automatically increases the Exalt’s Offhand Charge capacity by two, so that it becomes (Dexterity + Essence + 2). In addition, while the Exalt is in this stance, each time she crashes an opponent, her Offhand Charge’s capacity increases by one for the rest of the scene—but this benefit may occur no more than once for any single crashed opponent. In addition, using this stance allows the Steel Devil to ignore penalties for attacking with the off-hand. Lastly, this Charm reduces the cost of Double Attack Technique by one mote and Steel Devil Strike by two.
