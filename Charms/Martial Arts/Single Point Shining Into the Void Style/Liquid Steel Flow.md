*Moving faster than her foes can even blink, the stylist’s blade seems like a flowing river of steel.*
Liquid Steel Flow adds the stylist’s Dexterity to the raw damage of all her withering attacks. After landing a successful attack, she may pay a point of Willpower to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene. Making a decisive attack ends the Liquid Steel Flow, as the swordsman focuses all her speed into one deadly-perfect strike that converts up to (Dexterity/2, round up) dice of raw damage to automatic successes. If Fatal Stroke Flash is used to enhance this decisive attack, its Willpower cost is waived if the stylist paid Willpower into Liquid Steel Flow. While this style’s form is active, if the stylist and her sword both act on the same tick to make decisive attacks, then the benefits of this Charm apply to both attacks before it ends. The swordsman does not seem to make two attacks, but a single stroke of steel that can fell even the mightiest enemies. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood cannot pay Willpower to extend this Charm’s duration. 
## Mastery
As long as the martial artist is at Initiative 11+, he also adds one automatic success on all attack rolls he makes against enemies of lower Initiative.
