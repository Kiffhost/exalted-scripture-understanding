*Reciting a litany of life’s heartbreaks, the Abyssal makes the clouds to weep tears of deadly ice.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Weeping Sky Lamentation]], she may pay a ten-mote, two-[[Willpower]] surcharge to call down disastrous blizzards, deadly hailstorms, and similar natural disasters borne of ice and cold. This increases the roll’s difficulty by 5. Such perils have the following effects, in addition to any others the [[Storyteller]] deems appropriate:
 - The storm is an environmental hazard with difficulty 3, Damage 2L/minute. Trivial characters without protection from the elements may die instantly, at the Storyteller’s discretion. If the hazard forces a battle group to make a rout check, it’s made at +3 difficulty.
 - Mundane objects left unattended in the storm are severely damaged or destroyed in a matter of minutes, at the Storyteller’s discretion. Similarly, the frozen downpour may destroy small structures made of wood or similar materials, while even the largest and sturdiest structures are badly damaged.
 - Those caught in the storm suffer a –3 penalty on movement actions and on all vision- and hearing-based rolls. This penalty subtracts successes instead of dice from [[Perception]] rolls.
 - Exposed crops are destroyed and soil is rimed with permafrost, making it impossible to sow new crops for the rest of the story barring magical intervention.
 - Bodies of water freeze solid. They won’t thaw until the end of the story, though significant efforts or powerful magic can break up or melt the ice.
 - If a character uses weather-altering magic against the storm, 1s and 2s on his opposed roll subtract successes.
The Abyssal, her Circlemates, and anyone she guides with [[Shadowed Paths Unveiled]] are immune to these effects.
