The Lawgiver adjusts the scales of balance in her favor, and fate is made her accomplice. This Charm enhances any kind of action that is not part of an extended roll. Before rolling, the player chooses a number from 2 to 5. That number is treated like a 10 each time it appears in the subsequent roll. The Solar may use this Charm once per full night’s rest. An Essence 4+ repurchase allows the Solar to change two different numbers from 2 to 5 into 10s.
