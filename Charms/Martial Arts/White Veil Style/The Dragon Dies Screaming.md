The martial artist’s subtle touch is laced with deadly venom, Essence suffusing her strike with toxic potency. She makes a decisive attack that exposes her victim to this poison if it hits. The poison has Damage 4i/round (Aggravated in crash), duration (Essence + Manipulation) rounds, and a −(Manipulation) penalty. The cost of Birdsong Over Blades is waived when used with this attack. Rolls to diagnose this poison are made at +3 difficulty. The stylist may choose to delay the poison’s onset by anywhere from an hour to (Essence) weeks; the difficulty to diagnose it while delayed is increased by +5 instead. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully incapacitating a nontrivial enemy without any other character realizing the martial artist is responsible. 
## Mastery

No matter how many successes the target rolls to resist, the poison’s duration cannot be reduced below one round.
