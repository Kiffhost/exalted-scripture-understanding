*Each crime the Infernal uncovers is a treasure to be cherished, each secret a nail to drive into the iniquitous.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she uncovers one of someone’s secrets with a case scene or profile character roll. She intuitively recognizes how great of an impact that secret’s exposure would have on him. This is quantified like an Intimacy:
- Minor if it would be embarrassing or inconvenient
- Major if would have significant risk or consequences
- Defining if it would be life-changing.

Once the Infernal’s appraised a character’s secret, she can use this Charm to add non-Charm dice equal to the secret’s intensity on profile character and read intentions rolls against him, and on any influence roll in which she refers to the secret, even if it’s vague and indirect. If she explicitly reveals that she knows it or threatens to expose the secret, she converts the bonus dice to non-Charm successes.

If the target’s secret becomes widely exposed or becomes irrelevant, the Infernal can no longer use this Charm for that secret. However, if the Infernal is the one who reveals it, she gains one Willpower. She can only do so once per secret, and no more than once per day.
