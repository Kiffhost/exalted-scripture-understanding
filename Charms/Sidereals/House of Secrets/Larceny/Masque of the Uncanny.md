*Twisting the strands of her fate, the Sidereal inverts her semblance into that of her nemesis.*
The Sidereal rolls to instantly disguise herself as an enemy of fate, without needing equipment. She ignores penalties for disguising herself as characters of a different race, sex, or body type or impersonating specific characters. She can mimic the Caste Marks and anima banners of Exalted enemies of fate and manifest supernatural sensory displays appropriate to her disguise.
Characters without superhuman or magically enhanced senses can’t roll opposing the Sidereal’s disguise unless she acts out of character; even then, they suffer +1 target number. Success doesn’t reveal the Sidereal’s identity, only that she’s not what she seems.
With a Larceny 5, Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal is no longer limited to disguising herself as an enemy of fate. When disguised as a supernatural being, she can only alter her Caste Mark and anima banner or manifest sensory displays if she’s wearing a resplendent destiny appropriate to the disguise. The resplendent destiny doesn’t need to specifically be that kind of supernatural being — a Sidereal could mimic a Dawn Caste’s anima while wearing the destiny of a warlord.
A third purchase at Essence 3 protects against divination, magical scrying, magic based on someone’s identity, and similar effects. Such magic can’t provide information that contradicts this disguise, giving false results where necessary. Effects that enhance mundane efforts to contest her disguise are unimpeded.
