*Those who hear Death’s Lawgiver speak are enthralled by her eloquence, their suspicions withering like dying leaves.*
When the Abyssal makes a bargain, persuade, or instill roll, it also counts as a roll to instill her target with a Tie or respect or admiration to herself or weaken a negative Tie toward herself. Characters with negative Major or Defining Ties to the deathknight aren’t affected.
