As long as a character is speaking, the sorcerer ignores penalties on read intentions rolls against him due to not sharing a common language, not being able to hear him, or otherwise failing to comprehend his speech. Once per day, she can also add (Occult) dice on the roll if her target is singing or playing an instrument. 

As a four-dot Merit, she can spend one Willpower to understand whatever he’s saying on a successful roll and learn a useful fact about the target’s intentions or history.
