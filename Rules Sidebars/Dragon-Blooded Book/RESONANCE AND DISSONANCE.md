Different Exalted harmonize differently with each of the magical materials. An Exalt can be resonant with a material, neutral, or dissonant. The Resonant and Dissonant keywords mark Evocations that function differently depending on the userâ€™s connection to an artifact. Solars are resonant with all magical materials, while Dragon-Blooded are resonant with jade; neutral with orichalcum, moonsilver, and starmetal; and dissonant with soulsteel. See Arms of the Chosen, pp. 16-17, for more.
