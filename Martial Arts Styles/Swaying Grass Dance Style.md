# [[Swaying Grass Dance Style]]
This style’s strikes and motions resemble dancing more than a martial art, hearkening back to its origins in slave uprisings. Disguising their training as dances and religious celebrations, the legendary Swaying Grass Dancers of old honed their art to overthrow their captors.
The style is swift and unpredictable, employing feints and misdirection to force enemies off their rhythm. Dance-like footwork is key, used to maneuver around foes, evade attacks, and set up devastating kicks. Some dancers embrace the style purely as a fighting art, while others honor its history by covertly spreading it to slaves and the oppressed, fomenting rebellions and upheaval.
## Weapons
This style’s unarmed attacks are primarily kicks and knee strikes, though it also employs punches, elbow strikes, and headbutts. It also uses [[Club|batons]], [[Iron Boots]], and [[Knife|knives]]. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced by this style’s [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage.
## Armour
This style is incompatible with armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Performance]] is central to Swaying Grass Dance, while [[Dodge]] is used to outmaneuver foes.
