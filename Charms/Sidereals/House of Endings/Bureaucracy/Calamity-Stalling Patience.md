The Sidereal stands between Creation and all threats to it, holding at bay the worst that could happen. To use this Charm, the Sidereal must be actively opposing a crisis, disaster, or similar that has not yet reached its peak: fighting against an enemy army that has reinforcements on the way, getting people to shelter from an approaching hurricane, trying to stabilize a manse that’s about to explode, etc. While she continues to actively oppose the crisis, it can’t reach its peak: circumstance delays the enemy reinforcements, the hurricane’s advance slows, the manse remains stable long enough to give the Sidereal a chance to implement her plans. If the Sidereal chooses or is forced to stop her opposition, the crisis resumes building to its peak, although it’s delayed by however long she spent opposing it. This Charm can’t affect the Exalted or negate the effects of Charms and other magic. The Sidereal could prevent an enemy’s reinforcements from reaching them, but not their outcaste general. Reset: Once per story unless reset by achieving a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).
