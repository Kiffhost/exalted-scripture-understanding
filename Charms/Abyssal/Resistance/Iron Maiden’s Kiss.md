*The Abyssal’s coiling chains form two halves of an iron casket, lined with flesh-piercing spikes, before slamming shut around her victim like a gruesome maw.*
To use this Charm, the Abyssal must have [[Chain-and-Armor Mortification]] active. She makes a difficulty 6 ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) gambit against a foe within close range to trap him in an iron maiden. If successful, the iron maiden closes around him, dealing (Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + [[Initiative]] roll extra success) levels of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. Against an enemy grappled with her chains, each round of control adds an automatic success on the [[Initiative]] roll, and the grapple ends if she succeeds.
If the victim survives, he’s imprisoned within the iron maiden. He suffers the drawbacks of being grappled and takes (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) dice of lethal damage at the start of each of his turns, ignoring [[Hardness]].
While trapped, the victim can’t take actions that anything outside of the iron maiden, even with magic that would let him attack through full cover or perform similar feats. As a dubious consolation, he receives full cover while trapped. He and his allies can attempt to free him with appropriate actions, like feats of demolition or lockpicking, but such actions have a minimum difficulty of 7 and can’t be flurried.
Feats of demolition require [[Strength]] 7+.
An enemy slain by the iron maiden is reanimated as a war ghost (Exalted, p. 504) with a Defining Tie of terrified obedience to the Abyssal. It’s permanently merged with the iron maiden, as per its Forge-Born Form Charm, The iron maiden has the same base traits as the Abyssal’s armor, but is always mundane.
## Reset 
Once per scene. Using this Charm against a grappled enemy doesn’t count against this limit.
