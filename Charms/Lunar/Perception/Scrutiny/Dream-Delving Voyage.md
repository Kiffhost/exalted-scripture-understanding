*Descending into a sleeper’s dreams, the Lunar witnesses his heart laid bare.*
She makes a special ([[Perception]] + {Investigation, [[Occult]], or Socialize}) read intentions roll against a sleeping character, who suffers the −2 [[Guile]] penalty for being unaware of her. Success lets her witness one dream, plus an additional dream for every two extra successes. Each dream reveals a piece of useful information — an [[Intimacy]], a glimpse into a memory, a relevant clue for the Lunar’s investigations, etc. This Charm can only be used on a character one per day.
