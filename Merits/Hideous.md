*This Merit has no cost, and may be taken for free.*
The character is memorably ugly, possibly as a result of overt deformity, disfiguring scars, inhuman mutations, or just being born that way. His [[Appearance]] does not measure how attractive he is; instead, the more dots of [[Appearance]] he has, the more intimidatingly horrid he looks. The character adds his [[Appearance]] bonus to attempts to [[Threaten|threaten or intimidate]], rather than to [[Instill]] and [[Persuade]] actions.
### Drawback
The character subtracts his [[Appearance]] rating from most seduction attempts.
