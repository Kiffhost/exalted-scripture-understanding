Lightening her step and balancing carefully, the Exalt may run across fluid surfaces. She may dash over unstable surfaces as if they were solid and move over surfaces no thicker than rice paper without breaking through. At full speed, she may also move across lava or other dangerous surfaces without getting hurt. This effect lasts until the Exalt stops dashing. As long as she is moving at a quick pace, she need not pay the activation cost again. At Athletics 5, Essence 2+, the Exalt can pause on unstable surfaces without breaking through, changing the duration of this Charm to “one stunt.” She can walk slowly across the surface of a still pond, pause on the crumbling parapet of a castle to give a speech, and so on. This means if she’s using the Charm to dash across the water to reach a boat, then decides to pause on the water’s surface to address the captain, she must use the Charm twice. If the Exalt is still standing on an unstable surface and is unwilling or unable to renew Feather Foot Style, she becomes subject to the normal laws of gravity and buoyancy. Also note: while she may safely dash across a caustic or burning surface, standing on top of lava and other dangerous surfaces will cause harm.
