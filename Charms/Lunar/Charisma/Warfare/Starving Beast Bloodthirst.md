*Having endured the Lunar’s grueling regimen, her warriors are fearless and deadly.*
She gives a speech or performance to a battle group benefitting from [[Lessons of the Winter Wolf]]. In its next combat, the battle group enjoys perfect morale (Exalted, p. 210) and doubles [[Resolve]] bonuses from [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] against fear-based influence or influence that would make it stop fighting. The Lunar’s [[Charisma]]-based orders commanding the group to attack add dice equal to the dots of [[Size]] that group has lost that scene. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Berserker may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm.
