*Under the veil of night, the necromancer calls forth one of the restless dead to bind them in her service.*
At night or in the Underworld, the necromancer performs an hour-long ritual to summon an Essence 1–3 human ghost. A black portal forms above the ritual site, drawing the summoned ghost through, them reflexively. Alternatively, she can conceal her presence while spying through a single undead, muting the fire in its eyes. A (Perception + Occult) roll at difficulty 3 is required to notice the flame.
## Distortion (7)
A spellcaster within short range of the necromancer’s spy can distort this spell, fraying the necromancer’s connection to it. The spell ends if the undead takes any decisive damage.
