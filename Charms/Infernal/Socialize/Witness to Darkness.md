*The Green Sun Princes revel in the night cast by the Shadow of All Things. How could any lesser darkness blind them?*

The Infernal adds (Essence) dice on read intentions rolls. This bonus is non-Charm if the roll could catch someone in a lie. She also ignores penalties from poor lighting on Perception-based rolls with any Ability, and reduces the penalty for being in complete darkness by one.
## [[Keys]]
#### Weeping Dark Tears (Socialize 3)
The Infernal gains this Charm’s benefits permanently. She ignores visibility penalties from total darkness completely, and can see even while blinded, weeping tears of liquid shadow when she does. However, she suffers a −1 penalty on influence rolls that involve telling the truth, and a −1 on any Perception-based rolls made in direct sunlight. Exposure to bright light is painful, imposing this penalty on all rolls.
