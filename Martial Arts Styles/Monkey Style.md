# [[Monkey Style]]
Monkey style emphasizes misdirection, mobility, and unpredictability. It’s distinctive for its acrobatic maneuvers, with stylists tumbling, flipping, and cartwheeling around their foes. Its practitioners are called “blissful sages,” for laughter is frequently heard coming from this style’s schools. This isn’t just good humor — it’s training for this style’s arrhythmic breathing exercises. This jocularity often carries over to the battlefield, with stylists employing taunts, japes, and bewildering facial expressions to throw enemies off balance. Stoic, humorless practitioners are instead referred to as “stone monkeys.”
Monkey style is most commonly practiced in the East and Southeast. Its schools have a reputation for being far less formal or structured than those of other animal styles, with some resembling social clubs or dens of vice more than places of learning. It’s also among the animal styles commonly studied by Immaculate monks — predominantly stone monkeys, though some are blissful sages.
## Weapons
Stylists’ unarmed attacks employ open-handed slaps and clawing strikes, as well as rolling kicks from the ground. It’s also compatible with [[Club|batons]], [[Staff|staffs]], and [[Seven-Section Staff|seven-section staffs]], and with improvised weapons that are similarly shaped.
## Armour
[[Monkey Style]] is incompatible with armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Athletics]] is important for this style’s acrobatic maneuvering. Stylists use [[Performance]] or [[Presence]] for taunts and mockery.
