Era: The Fall of House Iselsi
---
Part of it came from Petal Glider, the vain daiklave that defeated the Grass Dancer at the Battle of Three Crossings for the sake of its master’s camaraderie with foreign traders. Another came from Crow’s Friend, which annihilated the Gutter Water Gang, opening Nexus to Iselsi ambitions. A third piece belonged to Amara, which slit Sesus’ cheek in revenge for a night of adulterous beauties now long forgotten. Now all that remains is Vengeant. Many of House Iselsi’s ancestral blades were destroyed by the Scarlet Empress for their foolish attempt to strike at her. She had fragments of each forged into a new weapon to remind the Iselsi of her mercy and of the state she’d forced upon them. The Iselsi took the lesson well. With their old blades they’d fought to create dynasties — with Vengeant, they would end them. 

## Evocations of Vengeant 

Vengeant remembers those who wronged its former wielders, and delights in the chance to humble their descendants. The wielder may focus Vengeant’s spite against a specific individual or group, marking him as despised, after one of the following events: 
- The wielder reveals her true identity and her enmity to the object of a negative Tie. 
- A Dragon-Blooded Iselsi scion discovers how the target or his ancestors have wronged House Iselsi. 
Vengeant gains +1 Overwhelming against despised opponents. This effect is indefinite, lasting until the wielder manages to destroy the target or rededicates Vengeant against a new despised individual or group.
