With this Charm, the Exalt may learn to speak and understand a language just by hearing it spoken. The Exalt must spend at least an hour being exposed to the language conversationally. She does not need to be the target of such talk, and can gain this exposure any number of ways: sidling a group of strangers, listening to a carnival barker, and attending a play are all valid examples. After an hour, the Exalt may activate this Charm. At that moment, her understanding of language congeals. As her Essence races to encompass this new system of words, she can speak and understand her new acquisition perfectly, though she retains a -3 penalty to social influence until she has retained and practiced the language intensely for a week. The Solarâ€™s understanding of this language is predicated by her commitment of Essence to the effect. Should she release the motes she has committed to this Charm, her knowledge of the language fades within the hour. However, if she works with an acquired language for a season or more, she learns it permanently and for free, and may safely end her commitment to the effect.
