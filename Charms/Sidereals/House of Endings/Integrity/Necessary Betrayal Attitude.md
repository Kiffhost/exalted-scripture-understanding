The Sidereal serves the world’s needs above all else; should fate demand it, she will turn her sword against those closest to her heart. The Sidereal gains +2 [[Resolve]] against influence that would instill her with a positive Tie toward an enemy of fate or strengthen such a Tie. For two motes, she may apply this bonus against any influence that leverages such a Tie. Acting against these Intimacies doesn’t cause her to gain [[Limit]] or cause her to suffer any ill effects from magic that punishes such violations. With [[Integrity]] 4, these benefits apply against mortals. With [[Integrity]] 5, they apply against all characters but other Sidereals.
