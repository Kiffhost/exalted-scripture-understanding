The Exalt may open a mundane lock simply by touching it and paying five motes. Alternately, she may challenge a sorcerous lock with her picking tools, paying one mote to gain double 9s and (Essence) automatic successes. This version of the Charm guarantees that she successfully picks the lock even if her roll fails, however, a failure constitutes some unwanted occurrenceâ€”perhaps she springs a trap, breaks the lock loudly, snaps her lock-pick, etc.
