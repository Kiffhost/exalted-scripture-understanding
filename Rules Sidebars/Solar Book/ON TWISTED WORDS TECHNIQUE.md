This Charm doesn’t actually invert Intimacies, though it ultimately causes characters to behave as if it did. When used to instill beliefs, this Charm may strengthen or weaken Intimacies as a normal instill action would. The difference is that it appears to strengthen an Intimacy when it is actually weakening it, or strengthens an Intimacy that it appears to weaken. For example, “You certainly look noble in purple,” convinces someone that he looks like a fool in purple, while “I can’t stand you, you’re insufferable,” only increases his desire to be around you. Just as a normal instill action, it may also be used to create contradictory Intimacies, though it appears to create an Intimacy which agrees. For example, one might get a monk with a Defining Intimacy for the Immaculate Order to agree that temple harlotry in Great Forks is bad far more easily than one might convince him that it’s good. By using this Charm to convince him that it’s bad, one convinces him to behave as if it’s good, giving him an Intimacy that, in some way, contradicts his core belief in the Immaculate Faith.
