## [[Power from adoration]]
Like Mara herself, the sorcerer draws power from those who love her. The [[Essence]] of their adoration is clay in her hands, taking form in her [[sorcery]]. Whenever she takes a shape [[sorcery]] action while within medium range of a character with an unrequited [[Intimacy|Tie]] of love (or a similar emotion) towards her, she may reap additional sorcerous motes equal to that [[Intimacy]]â€™s value (for example, four motes from a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]]). [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] can only be tapped for motes in this fashion once per day, and the sorcerer cannot harvest power from love she reciprocates. Normally she may only drain one [[Intimacy]] to fuel the casting of a spell, but she may draw power from any available [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] when casting her control spell. She cannot draw more than ten sorcerous motes per scene with this ritual.
