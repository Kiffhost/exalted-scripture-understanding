### Prerequisite
Stamina or Resistance •••
Perhaps the character is a poison taster, or perhaps she is simply hardier than most. Regardless, she adds two dice to rolls to resist poisons (see p. 232-233).
### Drawback
The character’s body can’t tell the difference between recreational toxins and intentional ones. It’s very difficult for her to become intoxicated.
