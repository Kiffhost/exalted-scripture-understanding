The Lunar’s innate genius for misdirection and beguiling presence can blind a man to a tiger staring him in the face. She makes a special (Manipulation + [Larceny, Performance, or Presence]) instill roll against a single target. If she succeeds, she prevents him from noticing one thing present in the scene — a character, object, natural feature, etc. Inanimate things that span more than a single range band can’t be concealed. The Lunar must continue speaking to maintain this concealment, doing so as a reflexive action on each of her turns. If the Lunar prevents her victim from noticing another character, this functions as though that character had successfully made a Stealth roll to establish concealment against her victim, including the potential to make surprise attacks. If that character breaks concealment by attacking or taking other overt actions, this Charm ends. If the Lunar conceals an object, terrain feature, or other inanimate thing, the target can’t notice it with any sense except touch. He could be rendered unaware of the sword sheathed at his side, the flames raging in a burning building, or the sudden drop of a cliff as he chases the winged Lunar toward it. While he may walk heedlessly into perils, he becomes aware of them with enough time to at least attempt to mitigate harm — if he fell off a cliff, he could attempt an Athletics roll to grab onto the cliffside before falling. If the Lunar’s misdirection imperils one of her victim’s DefiningIntimacies—forexample,ifaconcealedassassin movestocutdownhisbelovedhusband—thevictimmay spend one Willpower to resist this influence. Otherwise, this influence can’t be resisted with Willpower. ThisCharmcanonlybeusedonacharacteronceperstory. 
## Protean 

In shapes that her target has a Defining Tie of curiosity, fascination, love, desire, etc. toward, the Lunar adds (Essence) successes on her roll.
