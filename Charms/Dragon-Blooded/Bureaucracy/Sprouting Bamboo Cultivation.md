*The Dragon-Blood cultivates the growth of an organization as though it were her garden.*
This Charm supplements any project or other bureaucratic task that has the primary goal of amassing wealth or manpower: recruiting a work force, collecting taxes, selling goods at market, and similar tasks. She doubles 8s on any [[Bureaucracy]] roll necessary to complete the project, and gains five motes that can be spent on other [[Charms]] that enhance it.
