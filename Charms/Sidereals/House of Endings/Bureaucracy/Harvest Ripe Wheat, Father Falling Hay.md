The Sidereal need only stroll through a shop floor or come to a receptionist’s desk to take the measure of an office. When the Sidereal examines a business or bureaucratic entity, she rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) opposing the [[Guile]] of that group’s leader. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
-  How corrupt is this organization’s group culture? 
-  What forms of corruption should I be on the lookout for? 
-  Is this organization likely to notice if I perform some specific misdeed right now? 
-  Who here knows the most about this organization’s official business? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
