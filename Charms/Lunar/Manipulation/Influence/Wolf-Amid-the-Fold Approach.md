Clothed in stolen skin and speaking with anotherâ€™s voice, the Lunar exploits the web of relationships her prey has left behind. When she makes an influence roll using any social Attribute while in a stolen human form, characters with Major or Defining Ties to that form must pay one additional [[Willpower]] to resist. If all affected targets decline to resist with [[Willpower]], the Lunar gains one [[Willpower]].
