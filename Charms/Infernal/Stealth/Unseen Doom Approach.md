*The Infernal is not wholly without mercy, letting her victims guess at where she might be before she cuts down her next one.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after dealing 3+ decisive damage with an unexpected attack. She can forgo two levels of damage to reflexively roll Stealth to reenter concealment, ignoring the penalty for being in combat. She must still deal at least one level of damage. If her target was a trivial enemy, she doesn’t need to forgo damage maintains her concealment without needing to make another roll.

The Infernal reduces the amount of damage she must forgo by one for each condition that applies:
- She has concealment against all enemies.
- The attack is an ambush.
- Her target is crashed.
- Her target has a Tie of fear or trust to her.

The Infernal can also use this Charm when she incapacitates an enemy, even if the attack wasn’t unexpected. She doesn’t need to forgo damage to do so.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal waives this Charm’s Willpower cost if she uses it after an ambush made with [[Close-Enough Assassination Method]]. 
## [[Keys]]
#### Fading Shadow Strike
The Infernal is no longer limited to using this Charm with unexpected attacks.
#### Perfected Assassin Prowess (Essence 5)
As long as the Infernal meets at least one condition, she doesn’t need to forgo damage. She adds a non-Charm success on her Stealth roll for each condition she meets past the first.
