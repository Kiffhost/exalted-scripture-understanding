The Lawgiver lives in a haze of ghostly memories, of lives lost and battles won. Calling these fatal moments to hand, she makes her strike momentous. This Charm enhances an aim action from cover or stealth, adding (Essence x2) Initiative to the Solarâ€™s next decisive attack for the purposes of determining raw damage. If her attack misses, or she does not make a decisive attack following the aim action, this bonus Initiative is lost.
