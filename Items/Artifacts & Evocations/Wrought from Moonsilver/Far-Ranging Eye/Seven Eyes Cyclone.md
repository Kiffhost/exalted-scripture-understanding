Far-Ranging Eye glints madly as it flies in an arc, searching out thieves, traitors, and usurpers. To use this Evocation, the wielder must have Initiative 12+. She rolls one decisive attack against up to (Perception + 1) enemies within short range. This can hit concealed foes within range if the wielder designates fewer than the maximum number of targets, although they receive +3 Defense against it. The Storyteller chooses which hidden enemies are struck. The wielder divides her Initiative evenly among all hit enemies, rounded up, to determine the damage rolled against them. Concealed enemies damaged by the attack must roll (Dexterity + Stealth) opposing the levels of damage dealt to them, losing concealment on failure. The wielder can use Razor Vigil Meditation that scene against enemies struck by the attack, and can use Reflections on Adversity against any of them that night. 

## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by wielders resonant with Far-Ranging Eye.
