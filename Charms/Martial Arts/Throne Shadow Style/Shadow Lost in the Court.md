*The vizier adopts the stance of one who lurks behind the throne, vanishing behind her shadow fingers.*
When a shadow finger within close range crashes an enemy whose [[Initiative]] was higher than the stylist’s or deals 5+ levels of decisive damage, she may reflexively roll to establish concealment without needing a hiding spot. If the shadow finger has an anima banner, the stylist adds (his Anima) successes on the roll. In [[Throne Shadow Form]], this extends to shadow fingers within short range. 
## Terrestrial
This Charm’s minimums increase to [[Martial Arts]] 5, [[Essence]] 3. It can only be used once per scene unless reset by incapacitating an enemy with a decisive unexpected attack.
