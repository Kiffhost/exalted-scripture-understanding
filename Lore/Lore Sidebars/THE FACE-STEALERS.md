In Immaculate fables, the Changing Moons are masters of deception and betrayal, fomenting chaos and turmoil, and insinuating themselves into society with foul shapeshifting. Only the wise Dragon-Blooded can see through their lies to put an end to their destruction of lives and theft of souls. For their atrocities committed in the skins of the innocent, these Anathema are called the Face-Stealers.
