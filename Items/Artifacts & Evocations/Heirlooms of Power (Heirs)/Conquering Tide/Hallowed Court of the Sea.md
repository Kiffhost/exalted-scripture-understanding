Conquering Tide won’t allow the decks where Wind-onCresting-Foam once stood to be sullied by the footsteps of the guilty. While this Evocation is active, all characters aboard Conquering Tide suffer −1 Guile and a −3 penalty on all Manipulation-based rolls. However, they add one automatic success added on all Investigation rolls, rolls opposing disguise, read intention rolls that would uncover deception, and influence rolls that would cause their target to confess to a wrongdoing, and the cost of any effects enhancing such rolls are reduced by one mote each.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens for free when a character whom the captain believes has committed a crime that opposes one of her Major or Defining Intimacies comes aboard Conquering Tide. The captain need not be aware of that character’s presence.
## Resonant
Using this Evocation resets In Search of Justice’s once-per-session Resonant effect.
