*Under the veil of night, the necromancer calls forth one of the restless dead to bind them in her service.*
At night or in the Underworld, the necromancer performs an hour-long ritual to summon a human ghost of up to [[Essence]] 3. A black portal forms above the ritual site, drawing the summoned ghost through, accompanied by a wordless susurrus.
Ghosts summoned by this spell must be bound with an ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll against their [[Resolve]].
Ghosts with [[Essence]] 2+ or who are unusually potent — such as specters or sorcerers — gain +2 [[Resolve]] against this.
Success lets the necromancer impose a Defining Tie of loyalty to her for a year and a day that cannot be weakened or altered by any means. Alternatively, she may assign a task and a Defining Principle of “I must complete my task.” A ghost is bound by the letter of the necromancer’s commands rather than the spirit of them. If the necromancer fails, the ghost escapes back through the portal and cannot be bound for the rest of the story.
By default, the ghost is summoned from the Underworld; it’s a typical member of the “type” of undead to which it belongs (e.g., honored ancestor, mortwights, war ghosts). To summon specific ghosts, the necromancer must know a ghost’s name or identity and possesses a symbolic link to him such as a piece of his corpse, a treasured keepsake, or grave goods.

Why Bind Ghosts? While necromancers often bind ghosts for their deathly magic and to use them as unseen spies and servants, most summon the restless dead for their knowledge.
Necromancers seek the names and burial grounds of dead princes for their secrets, summon the shades of vengeful courtiers to uncover blackmail on their confidantes or rivals, and the ghosts of savants for their wisdom. While death and ghostly passions often distort memories of life, bound ghosts typically possess enough knowledge to be of use to the necromancer. Specific ghosts summoned for their knowledge possess an action pool of 6-8 dice in a relevant subject.
