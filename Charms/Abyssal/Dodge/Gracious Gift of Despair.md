*All attempts to strike the deathknight are futile, revealing the meaninglessness of life itself.*
If the Abyssal successfully dodges an attack, she counterattacks with a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Dodge) roll to instill a Principle expressing her attacker’s despair, helplessness, or insignificance. If she strengthens an existing Principle, it still requires a supporting Intimacy (Exalted, p. 215), but the Abyssal need not be aware of that Intimacy.
If the Abyssal succeeds, her attacker loses (Essence) Initiative. He can’t oppose her disengage rolls until the end of her next turn unless he pays one Willpower to resist, separate from resisting the instill roll.
