*As blood spills from her victim’s wounds, the Abyssal reaps a scarlet harvest of Essence and pain.*
When the Abyssal deals damage with a decisive attack, she steals one motes for each 10 on the damage roll. If her attack was unexpected or her target hasn’t taken a turn this round, the deathknight also steals motes for 9s — and 8s if both conditions are met. She can’t gain more than (Dexterity, Strength, or Wits) motes per round with this Charm.
