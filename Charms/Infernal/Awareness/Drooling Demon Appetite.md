*Having tasted a delicacy once, the Infernal can never be sated.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she consumes a portion of a character she can eat, like licking up blood. It can’t be more than (Essence) days old. She develops an insatiable craving for more:
- She gains a Defining Tie of hunger toward her target. She can’t voluntarily weaken it, and it can be reduced below Minor.
- Whenever her target is within range of her senses, she begins to salivate uncontrollably, alerting her to his presence even if he’s in concealment.
- She converts dice added by [[All-Hunger Rapacity]] to automatic successes on rolls against the target. She also adds its Awareness bonus on Join Battle rolls if she knows he’s present.
- She ignores deprivation penalties on rolls with any Ability opposing him.

If the Infernal fatally incapacitates and eats her target, she heals one level of non-aggravated damage.
## Special activation rules
This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived if the Infernal uses it together with [[Decadent Devil Indulgence]]. The Infernal gains only this Charm’s Intimacy, applying both Charm’s benefits to it.
