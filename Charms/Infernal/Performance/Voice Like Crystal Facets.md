*The Infernal’s voice is as beautiful as it is alien, like the sound of a thousand tiny crystals pouring through a sieve.*

The Infernal’s words can only be heard by those she wishes to hear them. Others hear only a pleasant humming of diamond sighs and glass whispers, though they can’t consciously notice anything unusual about this unless they pay one Willpower. Trivial characters can’t resist.
## [[Keys]]
#### Countless Facets Chiming (Performance 5)
The Infernal can convey multiple statements at once, choosing which one each listener hears. This allows her to flurry two voice-based influence rolls with any Ability as long as they have different targets. She doesn’t suffer any penalties for flurrying.
#### Disembodied Voice Tintinnabula (Performance 5)
The Infernal can speak with a voice like dozens of crystal chimes, making it impossible to identify her voice. Mortals and First Circle demons must spend an additional Willpower to resist.
