*The Sidereal may go unrecognized, but she’s a central figure in the lives of others, empowered by the lives and relationships that revolve around her.*
The Sidereal gains motes equal to the 9s and 10s on rolls with any Ability to inspire positive emotions, instill positive Ties, weaken negative Ties, or make bargains involving sensual pleasures. This can’t exceed the number of motes spent enhancing the roll, and it doesn’t stack with similar effects that grant motes.
When the Sidereal upholds a Major or Defining Intimacy that’s a positive Tie or compassionate Principle, she may gain five motes in place of the Willpower she’d normally receive.
