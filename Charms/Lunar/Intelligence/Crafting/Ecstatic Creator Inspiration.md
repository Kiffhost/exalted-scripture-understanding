*Exulting in triumph, the Lunar envisions untold possibilities.*
She gains craft points for meeting basic objectives as though she’d completed a major project (Exalted, p. 240) when she upholds a Defining [[Intimacy]] through knowledge, cunning, or intellectual prowess (note that this always fulfills the basic objective for upholding an [[Intimacy]]). As usual, if the Lunar succeeds with 3+ threshold successes on an action that upheld the [[Intimacy]], she gains three gold points and one silver point per objective.
