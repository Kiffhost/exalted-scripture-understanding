There are no boundaries, save those created by perception. The stylist makes a grapple gambit against an enemy within close range of a reflective surface that’s at least as large as he is. Charms that increase the distance the stylist can throw a grappled enemy increase the range from which she can trap him in a reflective surface for the grapple’s duration. If successful, she traps him within that surface. While trapped, he can perceive the outside world and speak with characters in it, but has no physical presence. The stylist is capable of attacking him by striking at the mirror. Each turn, the trapped enemy can attempt to escape the mirror, making a difficulty (stylist’s Essence) roll using (Mental Attribute + Occult) to find a way out or (Strength + Athletics) to make one. Success removes one round of grapple control, or two rounds with 3+ extra successes. He can also be freed by using a feat of demolition to destroy the mirror, but the difficulty to do is is increased by (Essence), even if it normally wouldn’t require a roll. Breaking the mirror from the outside causes him to suffer five dice of decisive lethal damage, ignoring Hardness — which the stylist and her allies are free to take advantage of.
