The character draws a close-range weapon, or readies a long-range weapon for use (stringing a bow, adjusting a brace of throwing knives, and so on). If a character wishes to change weapons during battle, he must use a draw/ready weapon action to do so. 

This action reduces a characterâ€™s [[Defense]] by 1 until his next turn. **Characters are assumed to begin combat with a weapon of their choice already drawn or readied, unless they are [[Rules !!Reference/Combat/Stealth#Ambush|ambushed]]**.!! Natural weapons such as fists and claws *never* need to be readied before use, making unarmed fighters very resistant to being blindsided.
