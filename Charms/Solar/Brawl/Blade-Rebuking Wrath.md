The Lawgiver may clash a withering or decisive attack with such fury that she knocks her foe’s weapon from his hands. This clash attack does no damage, but for every three extra successes on the attack roll, the opponent’s weapon is hurled an extra range band. There is no limit to how far it can be hurled. Using this Charm counts as the Solar’s attack action.
