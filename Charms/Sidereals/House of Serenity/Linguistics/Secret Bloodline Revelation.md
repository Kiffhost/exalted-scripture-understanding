*The Sidereal folds a signed petition into a paper crane, sending it fluttering off to roost in the Celestial Bureaucracy’s records of divine lineage.*
The Sidereal creates a familial relationship between a god and another character, proclaiming the god’s new child to the world. Neither character need be present for her to do so, but each must have signed the petition, a lengthy document written in Old Realm. These signatures may be procured through fraud, duress, or sharp practice; a Sidereal who’s stolen someone’s name with [[Name-Pilfering Practice]] (p. XX) may sign for them. The god becomes his newfound descendant’s parent for all purposes, including magic like [[Knot of Destiny]]. The descendant’s player may choose to have this overwrite her relationship with any of her other parents, whether by birth or adoption. This newfound parentage empowers her as a God-Blooded. Exalted descendants gain [[Divine Heritage]] as a training effect (p. XX). Mortals gain a pool of ten motes, (higher of their [[Essence]] or 3) [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]] appropriate to their parent, and [[Exalted Healing]] (Exalted, p. 165). They gain new [[Charms]] as their [[Essence]] increases; player characters may purchase them with experience points. The Storyteller should determine how non-human descendants are affected on a case-by-case basis. Generally, supernatural beings with [[Charms]] gain [[Divine Heritage]], while characters without mote pools benefit as mortals. Gods can’t be made children of other gods with this Charm. If a descendant is killed or ceases to be relevant to the story, its experience cost is refunded.
