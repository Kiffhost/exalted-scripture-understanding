*Death’s Lawgiver claims the shadowed places of the world for the dead, a dominion forsaken by the sun.*
The Abyssal desecrates a wilderness region, claiming it for the dead. It must be a single contiguous locale, like a forest, a bayou, or a mountain, but there’s no hard limit on how large a domain she can claim, save for the Storyteller’s discretion. She must spend at least a day traveling the entirety of the region, sowing teeth, bone-shards, and blighted seeds in the land.
If the chosen region is inhabited, any mortal or ghostly communities in the area must be made to either accept her presence or recognize that they cannot drive her away. If any supernatural beings occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Abyssal must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge. However, ghosts only count for this if their [[Essence]] equals or exceeds the Abyssal’s.
Claiming a domain imposes the following effects:
 - The undead add (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) automatic successes on [[Survival]] rolls and rolls to resist the domain’s mundane environmental hazards. They count as having a Minor Tie of obedience to the Abyssal.
 - The living can’t regain [[Willpower]] from sleep within the domain. They subtract (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) successes from [[Survival]] rolls and rolls to resist mundane environmental hazards as the land rejects them. They count as having a Minor Tie of fear to the Abyssal. Wild animals don’t suffer these effects and count as having a Minor Tie of obedience to the Abyssal  - Sunlight has no deleterious effects on the undead or things of the Underworld. It is always considered night for purposes of shadowlands and similar phenomena associated with death.
 - Wild animals that die within the domain are reanimated as undead horrors (p. XX).
 - Over the course of the story, a shadowland forms in the domain’s heart — the part of it that’s furthest from any towns, habitations, or similar developed areas. It spreads up to ([[Essence]] x10) miles outward from the heart, assuming no developed areas impede its spread. The shadowland opens into the nearest equivalent locale within the Underworld, often a primal afterlife related to death by wild animals, poisonous plants, or the like. The Abyssal can use [[Dark Roads of the Dead]] to travel to this shadowland without needing a roll.
 - If she uses [[Bleak Marches Wisdom]] for her domain, she doubles 7s on the roll and completes it instantly, without needing to scout in advance.
An Abyssal can only have one such domain at a time. If she dies, it endures beyond her death, though it may then be possible to break it with curse-breaking magic or a sorcerous working at the Storyteller’s discretion.
## Special activation rules
When the Abyssal uses [[Nightmare-Carving Murmur]] (p. XX) to reshape land into a wilderness, she can use this Charm reflexively to claim that territory as her domain.
