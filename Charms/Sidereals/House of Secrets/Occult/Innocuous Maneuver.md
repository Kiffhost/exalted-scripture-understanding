Wrapped in the terrible grandeur of the stars, the Sidereal presents a convincing case to the heavens. The Sidereal makes a ([Charisma or Manipulation] + [[Occult]]) persuade or bargain roll to convince a god to support her in some political matter, waiving the mote and [[Willpower]] costs to reduce the roll’s target number with the [[Occult]] Excellency. Spirits other than gods who hold positions in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] can also be affected. Resisting this influence costs three [[Willpower]]. Targets can’t use [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] of corruption, greed, self-indulgence, or laziness to bolster their [[Resolve]] against this influence or in the [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] to resist.
