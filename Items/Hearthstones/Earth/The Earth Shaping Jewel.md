This stone allows anyone who has touched the jewel within the last day to turn unworked stone into clay or transform dirt or clay into stone. To accomplish this feat, the jewel must have been in the same location for at least one full week and people who have touched the jewel can only affect earth or stone within three miles of the jewel. Anyone using the power of this jewel must touch the stone or earth they wish to transform. Each touch can transform up to one cubic yard of earth or stone. This transformation takes roughly a minute to complete.
