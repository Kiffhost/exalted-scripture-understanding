*With a smile and a graceful spin, the Abyssal effortlessly turns her opponent’s blades back to their throats.*
The Abyssal clashes an attack with (Dexterity + Dodge).
If successful, her enemy’s attack is turned back against him, hitting him automatically and retaining all effects used to enhance the original attack. Any Initiative a redirected withering attack would grant the attacker goes to the stylist instead.
If the Abyssal knows Foe-Shaming Defense, winning the clash also knocks her enemy prone.
