Eternally true to herself, the Lunar shines with incomparable certainty. When she succeeds on a Charismabased influence roll that upholds an Intimacy, she gains (Intimacy) motes. This can’t exceed the number of motes she spent enhancing the roll. If the Intimacy upheld is to the Lunar’s Solar mate, she treats it as Defining. If it’s already Defining, she gains an additional mote.
