*The Infernal rides with wild abandon, trusting in her steed to shatter any obstacle in their path.*

The Infernal’s mount rolls a feat of demolition as it goes on a devastating rampage, laying waste to a large-scale structure: a mountain, a fortress, a basalt cyst on Malfeas’ city-body, etc. The mount adds (Infernal’s Strength) to its effective Strength for the feat and adds non-Charm dice on the roll equal to the feat’s Strength minimum. The rampage takes only a minute to complete, unless the Infernal indulges her mount. The mount also receives [[Basalt-Cracking Step]]’s effects for the duration of the rampage. Trivial characters caught in the havoc die gruesomely.

For the largest structures, the mount’s rampage can only demolish a portion of the structure that extends out to medium range from a central point — or long range, if it has Legendary Size. The consequences of partial destruction vary based on the specifics: taking out a load-bearing pillar might topple a whole temple, while a city’s walls remain standing even after her mount breaks through. Regardless, a successful feat should always be advantageous to the Infernal. Smashing through a fortified keep might leave it incapable of withstanding a siege even if it still stands; trampling a mountain underfoot may cause landslides, seismic aftershocks, or similar natural disasters.

Alternatively, the Infernal can direct a Legendary Size mount to demolish a structure that obstructs its path or otherwise stands in its way. Doing so converts the added dice to non-Charm successes. Instead of a broad swathe of destruction, the mount charges the obstacle straight-on, carving a path through it to reach its goal. There’s no limit on range, though traveling long distances takes as long as it would normally. With sufficient time and a high enough roll, the mount could complete a course through any structure, whether it’s a palace or a whole mountain.

Note that feats made with this Charm may have a difficulty higher than the listed examples (Exalted, p. 231). Smashing through every wall of a fortress might be difficulty 25, while boring a path through an entire mountainside might be difficulty 30. When demolishing a portion of a larger structure, the Infernal may be able to inflict greater collateral consequences by attempting a higher-difficulty feat.

#### Summit-Leveling Enthusiasm (Essence 5) (10m)
Once per story, the Infernal can unleash complete destruction by paying ten motes after successfully charging through a structure that was in her mount’s way. Over the course of an hour, the structure is ravaged by the spreading shockwaves of the Infernal’s charge. This culminates in its complete destruction, with devastating consequences for the surrounding area: A mountain collapses into rubble, burying nearby villages under avalanches. A palace falls, taking most of the surrounding district with it. The sea pours wildly into a newly-carved harbour, sweeping away whatever remains. The Infernal can reset this by accomplishing a legendary social goal by causing large-scale destruction, but it can’t reset itself.
