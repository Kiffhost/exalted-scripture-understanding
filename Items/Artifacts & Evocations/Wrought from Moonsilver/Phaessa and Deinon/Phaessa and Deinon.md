*The haunted, blood-soaked forests of Ashbloom, deep in the Northeast, once held Logerion, a shining arboreal metropolis of the First Age.*
Knows-the-Horizon, a young Lunar socialite and savant, was drawn to the cosmopolitan city, with its wise birds, its palaces of living wood, and its Solar queen’s joyous court. When Logerion burned in the Usurpation, its queen and her favorites put to the sword, Knows-the-Horizon fled into the Northeast’s deep forests. Isolated from the elegant dance of urban society and the depths of the First Age’s libraries and scholastic societies, she sought out the mystic Opal Heart, whose teachings offered solace in contemplating the intricacies of wilderness spirit courts and the mysteries of Luna’s cycle of change. In recognition of that cycle, Knows-the-Horizon forged a pair of moonsilver blades, calling down the minor moon-gods [[Phaessa and Deinon]] and — in exchange for rediscovering the key to the Midnight Sky Gate and returning it to the Court of the Silver Chair — binding them into the swords that would bear their names. She blooded her new blades well against the Shogunate. When she perished in battle, others in the [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] took up the swords in her name. These paired blades are curved like scimitars, or the crescent moon. Etchings on each blade bear lost scriptures to Luna in a forgotten First Age tongue. But while their form is identical, the two can’t be mistaken for one another. Phaessa shines a brilliant silver-white, humming with predatory intensity; Deinon gleams darkly beneath its tarnish, cleaving the air with a susurrus of whispers. 

## [[Evocations]] of [[Phaessa and Deinon]]

Depending on which blade’s power is ascendant, the blades can be either waxing, waning, or neither. While waxing, Phaessa dazzles prey with searing silver radiance, adding one non-Charm die to threaten rolls and withering damage rolls. While waning, Deinon bewilders foes with a hypnotic play of shadows, adding one non-Charm die to [[Stealth]] rolls and decisive damage rolls. The blades become waxing upon incapacitating an opponent. They become waning upon gaining an [[Initiative]] Break. Whenever the blades become waxing, they cease to be waning, and vice versa. The blades cease to be waxing or waning at end of scene. When a resonant wielder wins [[Join Battle]], the blades become her choice of waxing or waning.

# LONE BLADES

If the wielder employs Deinon without Phaessa — if she’s been disarmed of Phaessa, for example — she gains no benefits from the blades being waxing. If she wields Phaessa without Deinon, she gains no benefits from the blades being waning.
