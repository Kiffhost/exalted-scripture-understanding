Fond Remembrance cuts deep, wounding body and mind.
The wielder makes a false memory gambit, adding her attack roll extra successes as dice on the Initiative roll.
The gambit’s Initiative roll also deals decisive damage, even if it doesn’t meet the gambit’s difficulty.
If the attack hits, the wielder resets to base Initiative instead of paying the gambit’s Initiative cost, but she can’t use this Evocation if she doesn’t have enough Initiative to pay that cost without crashing herself.
## Dissonant
The wielder can’t add more than (Manipulation) attack roll extra successes as dice.
