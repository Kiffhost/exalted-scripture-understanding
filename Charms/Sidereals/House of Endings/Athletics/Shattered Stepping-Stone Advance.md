The ground erupts beneath the Sidereal’s feet as she springs into action, driving her forward with the force of its destruction. The Sidereal rolls a (Strength + Athletics) feat of demolition to destroy whatever surface she stands on or create a crater in large surfaces like the ground, gaining Hungry Touch’s benefits for free. Success propels her forward, letting her either dash up two range bands horizontally in a straight line or leaping two range bands vertically up and one range band horizontally. This counts as her movement action. If this would bring her within close range of an enemy, he rolls (Dexterity + Athletics) opposing her feat; success forces her to choose another destination not within close range of him. 

## Special activation rules

This Charm can be flurried with an attack against an enemy within close range at the end of the Sidereal’s movement.
