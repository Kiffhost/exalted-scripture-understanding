By spending an hour meditating on a charter of an organization she owns or leads, the Lawgiver may instill that charter with Intimacies that she feels are essential to running her business. This code of honor must be reflected in the writing of the charter, and the charter itself must be made available to every member the Solar wishes to effect with this Charm. Members who read the charter, or have had it read to them by a superior, become aware of the imbued Intimacies and can choose to act as the Solar would, taking advantage of those Intimacies as if they possessed them. Such a member can, for example, cite the Solar’s [[Intimacy]] in a decision point when someone is trying to promote corruption in the ranks of the Exalt’s subordinates. The effects of this Charm last until the Solar alters the charter, and may even continue beyond her death.

### On [[Honor-Instilling Mantra]]

The backer wanted a [[Bureaucracy]] Charm that would allow him to instill the organization’s members such that they would always act as the Solar would. I felt that was way too powerful. Mind-controlling hundreds of people with a single Charm defeats the purpose of social influence. Instead we came up with a Charm that allows members of an organization to consult the Solar’s vision of honor and leadership, creating a communal well of ethical and moral action to draw strength from. No one under the effect of this Charm is forced to abide by it, but there are undeniable benefits for those who do. Couple that with the power of the prerequisite and the Solar gains a very sharp understanding of what goes on in her offices while she is not there. Special thanks goes to Holden for the core mechanic of this Charm. Backer: J Walker
