The Solar is crippled by self-doubt. He will seek the assistance of his allies in every task, no matter how simple, and will pass his duties and responsibilities on to others whom he believes are more capable than him. If he is separated from allies, he must try to return to them or else find some other companions, and will flee from any potential danger or obligation he encounters along the way.
Crushing Doubt can be ended prematurely if the Solar is forced to face a significant danger alone and succeeds, or if he single-handedly saves an ally from a significant danger.
