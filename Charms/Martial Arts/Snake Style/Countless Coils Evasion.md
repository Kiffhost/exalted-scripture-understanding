Moving with the reflexes and raw speed of a startled snake, the martial artist leaves no flaw in her defenses. After the damage roll of a decisive attack against her, the martial artist may use this Charm to roll (Essence + Initiative). Each success on her roll negates a level of damage from the attack, after which she is reset to base Initiative. If this successfully negates all damage from the attack, then the martial artist emerges unscathed, revealing that what her opponent struck was only an afterimage, and adds +2 to her base Initiative when she resets. This Charm is incompatible with any other effect that reduces the damage of a decisive attack. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood must use this Charm before the damage of an attack is rolled, with each success subtracting a die of raw damage, and may only use it once per scene.
