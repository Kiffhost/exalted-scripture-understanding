*Wrapped in the terrible grandeur of the stars, the Sidereal presents a convincing case to the heavens.*
The Sidereal makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Occult) persuade or bargain roll to convince a god to support her in some political matter, waiving the mote and Willpower costs to reduce the roll’s target number with the Occult Excellency. Spirits other than gods can also be affected if they hold positions in the Celestial Bureaucracy.
Resisting this influence costs three Willpower. Targets can’t use Intimacies of corruption, greed, self-indulgence, or laziness to bolster their Resolve against this influence or in the Decision Point to resist.

This Charm can only be used against a spirit once per story.
