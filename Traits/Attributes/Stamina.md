Stamina is a measure of vitality. In combat, having a high Stamina rating reduces the damage of withering attacks. Itâ€™s also used to fight off [[poison]] or [[Rules Reference/Disease]], and more generally to endure the effects of anything that might weaken or assail the body, be it lengthy physical exertion, sleep deprivation, [[Deprivation|suffocation]], [[Environmental Hazards|exposure to the elements]], or [[Deprivation|starvation]].
