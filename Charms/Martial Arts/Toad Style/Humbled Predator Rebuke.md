The stylist strikes a well-timed blow to an enemy still reeling from her poison.
When the stylist attacks a poisoned enemy, the poison’s penalty applies to his Defense, up to a maximum penalty of (stylist’s Stamina). She adds the same amount in dice of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage on the attack. If an enemy suffers from multiple poisons, only the highest penalty applies.
If the stylist crashes a poisoned enemy or deals 3+ decisive damage one, the poison’s duration is increased by one.


## Special activation rules

This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived when used with Trouble the Still Pond.

## Terrestrial
The maximum is (lower of Essence or Stamina).
