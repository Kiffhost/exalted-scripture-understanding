*Stepping out of the way of her suitor’s attention, the Sidereal lets the arrow of his infatuation find a new mark.*
The Sidereal makes a special ({Appearance or Manipulation} + Dodge) instill roll against a character who has a positive Tie toward her or who intends to court, flirt with, or seduce her. Such Ties can’t be used to bolster his Resolve against this influence; Ties of romantic or sexual interest toward the Sidereal penalize his Resolve against it. If successful, she dodges his interest in her, redirecting it to another character he can observe. (If no such character exists, this Charm has no effect.) Any positive Ties the target has toward the Sidereal become Ties toward the other character. If he has such a Tie to a category that includes the Sidereal (e.g., tall people), it changes to a category that includes the other character but not the Sidereal. If he’s currently actively pursuing the Sidereal, he’ll do so with the other character instead. He forgets having ever been interested in the Sidereal.
If the affected character is reminded of his previous feelings toward the Sidereal, he may spend one Willpower to resist this. Altered Intimacies return to normal. If he had a Tie of romantic or sexual desire toward her, he must pay three Willpower to resist.
