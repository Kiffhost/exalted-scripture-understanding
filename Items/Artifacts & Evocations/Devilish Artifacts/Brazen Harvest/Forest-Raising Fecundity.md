*Brazen Harvest causes stone to froth and metal to spasm, great trunks and twisting vines growing from the ferment to protect its wielder from harm.*

The wielder creates a wall, barricade, or other simple construction from the Brazen Harvest’s growths. In combat, she can create a barrier sufficient to provide her with light or heavy cover and reflexively roll to take cover behind it, or create similarly-sized structures. With a few minutes, she can create larger structures, up to a story tall and with up to (Essence) internal chambers. Characters who are touching or inside these structures add one Willpower to the cost of resisting influence that leverages their Intimacies of greed or desire for violence.

This Evocation grants (Essence) automatic successes to a Strategic Maneuver roll for a Fortifications stratagem. The increased Willpower cost applies to all characters on the battlefield. Such uses have instant duration.

Destroying or damaging such structures require a Strength 5+ feat of strength at a difficulty of (5 + wielder’s Essence). They crumble away once this Evocation ends.
### Resonant
This Evocation has Indefinite duration.
