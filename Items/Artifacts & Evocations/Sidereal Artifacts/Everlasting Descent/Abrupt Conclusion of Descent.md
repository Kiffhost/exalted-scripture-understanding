*The wielder lends Everlasting Descent’s force to the invisible tether of gravity that binds an enemy to the earth, strengthening it into an unbreakable chain.*
To use this Evocation, the wielder must have Spin 1+. An enemy damaged by a decisive attack or dragged by Engulfing Orbit Pulls gambit falls prone. For the rest of the scene, he suffers a penalty on all physical rolls equal to the wielder’s Spin at the time she attacked, although it can’t exceed the total levels of damage he suffered. It subtracts successes instead of dice from rolls to rise from prone, and an affected character must always roll to do so. If he fails, he loses two [[Initiative]], which the wielder gains. 
## Resonant
The penalty inflicted increases by one, although it still can’t exceed the total damage dealt. The wielder doesn’t need any Spin to use this Charm.
