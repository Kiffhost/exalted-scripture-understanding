*The Sidereal turns the forces arrayed against her to her advantage, replenishing her quiver with her enemies’ arrows.*
After successfully dodging a ranged attack, the Sidereal can use this Charm draw its projectile, blast, or the like into her anima like an arrow in a quiver. [[Artifact]] weapons are immune to this. Stored projectiles are visible only while the Sidereal’s anima is at burning or higher. The next time the Sidereal is attacked — even by an ambush — she clashes it with a decisive attack using a stored projectile, sending it flying from her anima. The Sidereal can also use this Charm to store familiars within her anima. If she uses one to clash, it makes the attack roll, flashing into close range with her attacker. The Sidereal can stack up to ([[Essence]]) uses of this Charm.
