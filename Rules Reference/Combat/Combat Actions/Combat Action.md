# Social Actions
All of the social actions work normally during combat, although within the dictates of common sense—you can certainly shout out a fast, desperate offer to triple a mercenary’s pay if he’ll switch sides in the midst of battle (a bargain attempt), or even confess your hopeless love for the beautiful Abyssal trying to take your head (an instill action), but trying to engage in complex contract negotiations in the space of a single turn is probably absurd.

All social actions are considered [[Combat Action]]s, and may be placed in a [[Flurry]]. They’re resisted as normal. One special case is worth independent consideration: [[Surrender]].
