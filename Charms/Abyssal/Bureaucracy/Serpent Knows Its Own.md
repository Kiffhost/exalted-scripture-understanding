*Death’s Lawgiver knows the worth of all things, whether measured in silver, grain, or blood.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([Perception or Wits] + [[Bureaucracy]]) read intentions roll against someone seeking to buy from her or otherwise deal with her in a mercantile context. Success reveals his [[Resources]] rating and whether he intends to cheat or exploit her in their deal. If he does, she adds ([[Essence]]) [[Resolve]] against all bargain rolls that character makes in that scene.
Alternatively, if the Abyssal can’t tell if someone is interested in buying her wares or otherwise engaging in trade with her, she can use this Charm to discern both his intent and his [[Resources]] rating.
