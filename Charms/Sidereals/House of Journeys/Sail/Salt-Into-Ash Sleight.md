Clapping her hands, the Sidereal wreathes a spirit in an aura of yellow fire, an omen presaging a sudden journey. The Sidereal makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [[Sail]]) persuade roll against a spirit within medium range. Water elementals and other spirits associated with water count as having a Major [[Intimacy]] supporting this influence. If the Sidereal succeeds, that spirit recalls some unfinished business he has in another place. It presses increasingly on his mind, imposing a −3 penalty on any rolls he makes that don’t directly aid in attending to that matter. Once the scene ends, the urgency of the spirit’s business becomes unbearable. He enters a Decision Point and must spend one [[Willpower]] to not immediately set off for that location. He must travel toward that location and attend to his unfinished business, if possible, for at least (10 – his [[Willpower]]) hours before he can stop; [[Willpower]] 10 spirits must spend at least five minutes before they can stop. The unfinished business isn’t created by the Sidereal; rather, this Charm provides a narrative guarantee that the spirit does have some such unfinished business to attend to. The Storyteller chooses its nature, which the Sidereal doesn’t learn.
