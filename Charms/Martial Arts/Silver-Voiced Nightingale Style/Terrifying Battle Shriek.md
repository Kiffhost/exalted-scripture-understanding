*The Nightingale’s voice rings out in a deafening overture or in mocking lyrics, promising a horrible death to her foes.*
The martial artist rolls (Charisma + Performance) to intimidate a single enemy. A successful influence roll strikes fear into the enemy’s heart, forcing him to take a movement action on his next turn to move away from the martial artist or hide from her, if possible. Very weak or cowardly opponents may surrender or retreat entirely. Unlike other Simple Charms, Terrifying Battle Shriek may be placed in a flurry, and benefits from being used against enemies who have been hit with a kiai attack on the same turn. The target of this Charm is treated as having a Minor Tie of fear towards the martial artist if he has been hit with a kiai on the same turn, or a Major Tie if the kiai attack was decisive. 
## Mastery
An enemy who yields to the Nightingale’s influence and retreats or cowers from her loses Initiative equal to her (Charisma/2). She does not gain this Initiative.
