All humanity is the Sidereal’s friend; she need never want for a place to lay her head. After a few hours or days spent in a community, the Sidereal’s assured to find at least one resident, chosen by the Storyteller, who’ll let her stay at his home for a few days as if hosting an old friend. (Players may volunteer their characters for this.) He’ll keep her as well-fed as anyone in the house and providing her a spare bed, couch, or floor to sleep on. Once she’s worn out her welcome, she’ll quickly find another host without needing to use this Charm again, moving to a new home every few days. Alternatively, the Sidereal can empower hospitality that’s already been offered to her, though she must still avoid wearing out her welcome. As long the Sidereal she lives with these newfound friends and spends significant time interacting with them over downtimes, she gains the following benefits: 
-  She’s welcomed into her friends’ community; its members treat negative Ties toward foreigners, strangers, or outsiders as one step weaker for her. 
-  When she sleeps in her host’s house, she gains an additional Willpower from a full night’s rest. 
-  It’s difficult to keep track of her as she moves from home to home; Investigation and tracking rolls against her suffer +1 target number. 
-  She can use Favorable Inflection Procedure against multiple members of her friends’ community, waiving multiple target penalties.
