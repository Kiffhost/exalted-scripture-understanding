Attuning herself to the ambient Essence of the world, the Solar can see the order of and links between objects. This Charm supplements a case scene action, making that action infallible, and reducing the time it takes to just seconds. Even if the Exalt’s (Perception + Investigation) roll turns up no successes, she gains at least one clue to her investigation. For each additional success, the Storyteller describes the Solar’s mind racing from clue to clue, making logical connections that would be impossible for most people, and describing how those connections work to advance the Solar’s inquest. Such clues should provide the player with information that constitutes leads to characters, places, and events that will automatically trigger Watchman’s Infallible Eye when encountered. The Solar can also automatically tell if there has been an attempt to conceal evidence. This Charm may also be used to supplement a profile character action in an identical fashion, extra successes creating an incredibly precise, detailed and accurate analysis of the target. Ten Magistrate Eyes is enhanced by Awareness Charms, allowing the Solar to notice truly improbable details, like differentiations in heartbeat in concert with a character’s behavior, variations in the mud color of footprints that give away a person’s earlier location, and so on.
