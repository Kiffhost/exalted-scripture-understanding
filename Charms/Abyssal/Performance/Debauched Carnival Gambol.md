*The Abyssal’s wild dance stirs her audience to a frenzy, for they all might die before dawn.*
The Abyssal makes an ([[Appearance]] + [[Performance]]) inspire roll over the course of a few minutes, adding ([[Essence]]) bonus dice. Affected characters suffer a −3 penalty on [[Perception]] rolls and [[Join Battle]] rolls, and treat any Intimacies related to discipline, fear, or self-restraint as one step weaker.
With [[Performance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, if the Abyssal uses this Charm on characters engaged in a social event, like a gala, festival, or wedding, she may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to have the inspired emotions last for the duration of that event, rather than just one scene. She can only do so once per event.
