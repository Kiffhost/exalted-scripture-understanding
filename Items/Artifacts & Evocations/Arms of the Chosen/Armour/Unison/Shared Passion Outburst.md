The Exalt’s passions become the armor’s passions. [[Unison]] suffuses her strikes with more force and speed when it senses that they hold great import. To use this Evocation, thewearermustbeinQuicksilverHostMienorFinalUnity Mien. She chooses an [[Intimacy]] that represents her reason for fighting, and adds ([[Intimacy]]) to the Overwhelming rating of all her withering attacks for the rest of the scene.

As long as the wearer isn’t dissonant with moonsilver, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] while in any of Unity’s miens.
