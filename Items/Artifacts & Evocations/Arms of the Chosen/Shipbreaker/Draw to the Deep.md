The wielder launches a bolt weighted with the pull of the watery abyss. This attack — which can only be used against vehicles, warstriders, creatures of legendary size, and other large-scale targets — embeds a cumbrous bolt in the target’s hull or body. In combat, this is a difficulty 4 gambit. In naval combat, it takes the form of a broadside stratagem, which also has its normal effects. Encumbered targets subtract two dice from all combat movement pools, add one to the difficulty of all Sail or Ride rolls to navigate hazards, and suffer a one-point penalty to Speed and Maneuverability in naval combat. Cumbrous bolts lose potency at end of scene, or if removed with a Strength 5+, difficulty (Essence + 5) feat of strength (Exalted, p. 229).
