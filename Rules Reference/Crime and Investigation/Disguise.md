A character can roll ([[Intelligence]] + [[Larceny]]) to create a disguise that masks her true identity. Doing so requires about five minutes spent in costuming, applying make-up, and getting in character. She may take penalties on the roll if her fake identity is of a different sex, race, or body type— in general, a -2 penalty for each that applies. On a successful roll, the disguise works. Anyone who interacts with the disguised character for around five minutes or more is entitled to a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll to notice that the character is in disguise and get a sense of what she really looks like. The difficulty of this roll is equal to the number of successes rolled on the initial ([[Intelligence]] + [[Larceny]]) roll.

Creating a disguise that specifically imitates another person uses the same rules, but is more involved. The character takes a -4 penalty on the roll, but reduces it by -1 for each week she spends observing the person she wishes to imitate. In addition, if an observer who knows the person she’s impersonating sees her acting “out of character” then he may make an additional ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll to see through the disguise, and receive 1-3 bonus dice based on the severity of the lapse.
