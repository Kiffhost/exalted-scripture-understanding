*The necromancer caresses a mirrored surface as she looks through the reflection to the dark vistas of the Underworld beyond it.*
In a minute-long ritual, the necromancer transforms a reflective surface that’s at least as large as she is into a passageway to the Underworld. It remains open for (higher of 3 or the necromancer’s [[Essence]]) rounds, allowing instantaneous passage to and from the Underworld. Near shadowlands, the necromancer emerges at an area bearing similarity to her location in Creation. Far from the shadowlands, she emerges in a liminal space, such as the tomb-sanctuary from a nearby burial, or on the Sea of Shadow’s bleak shores. Once the portal closes, it cannot be used again. Mirrors crack, water boils, and silver tarnishes irrevocably.
Alternatively, the necromancer may open a portal to a random destination within the Labyrinth. She murmurs a discordant incantation to perform the ritual, slashing the air with a prepared blade. The fabric of Creation tears open to reveal a portal of shining darkness to a place of power within the Labyrinth’s confines. This portal only goes one-way; she must leave the Labyrinth through her own power once she passes through.
## Control
By performing a funeral rite with the appropriate trappings, the necromancer may instead cross into a primal or ritual afterlife known to her, disappearing to the Underworld as if she had died after being laid to rest. Injuries sustained as part of the process, such as being burned on a pyre, heal upon her arrival, though this doesn’t make the process any less painful. Those who interact with the necromancer receive disturbing visions of their own burial.
## Distortion (5)
Distortion allows only a single subject to pass through the gateway before the spell ends.
If one has already passed through, the spell terminates.
