Sometimes your ship’s mast suddenly explodes. Not a problem if you are one of the Solar Exalted! With this Charm you can quickly build a ship’s mast out of whatever is lying around. Cook-pots, old shoes, the ship’s cat, jewelry, loose weapons, and other contraband will interlock tighter than the chains that hold up the walls of Pale Dominion. Building this mast is an action that takes the Solar just a handful of seconds, though that doesn’t account for gathering the materials. At the end of the scene, when the Charm ends, the magic holding up the mast fails and it all comes tumbling down. Disclaimer: Ship’s cat was not harmed in the writing of this Charm.
