*The martial artist strikes with a gentle blow, cleansing a patient’s body and spirit as cool rain washes away blood and tears.* 
Upon purchasing this Charm, the stylist expands Perfect Reconstruction Method with one of the following techniques, letting her forgo levels of healing to treat other ailments or empower her patient in other ways. She can use multiple techniques together. Some techniques require her to pay a surcharge; others require prerequisite techniques. 
This Charm can be repurchased any number of times, each granting another benefit. 
### Essence-Aligning Touch
The stylist grants her patient four motes per level of healing she forgoes. 
### Will-Tempering Touch (+10m; requires Essence-Aligning Touch)
The stylist grants her patient one Willpower per level of healing she forgoes. 
### Hex Negation Technique (Requires Will-Tempering Touch)
The stylist can negate a Shaping effect or a sorcerous curse, like the spell Corrupted Words (Exalted, p. 472) by forgoing levels of healing equal to the Essence of the character responsible. 
### Spiritual Parasite Banishment (Requires Hex Negation Technique) 
The stylist can banish a possessing spirit by forgoing (its Resolve/2, rounded up) levels of healing. 
### Trauma-Erasing Touch (Requires Will-Tempering Touch)
The stylist can forgo one level of healing to erase a scene’s worth of memories that are painful, traumatic, or a source of grief or regret. If her target is unwilling, this fails unless her Initiative roll also beat his Resolve. A character presented with evidence of his erased memories may pay three Willpower to restore a single scene’s worth of them. 
### Impurity-Purging Flow
The stylist can completely purge a disease or poison from her target’s system by forgoing levels of healing equal to a disease’s morbidity or a poison’s remaining duration. 
### Wound Negation Touch (Requires Impurity-Purging Flow)
The stylist can permanently reduce crippling penalties from temporary injures by one point per level of healing she forgoes; reducing an effect’s penalty to zero negates it completely. 
## Enlightenment
The stylist can also learn the following techniques. Getimians can only use them while their Essence is Flowing. 
### Essence Template Restoration (+10m, 1wp; requires Wound Negation Touch)
The stylist can heal permanent crippling effects, forgoing two levels per point of penalty for missing digits, a lost eye, a mangled foot, etc.; three levels per point for a severed hand, congenital blindness, organ failure, etc.; or four levels per point for severed limbs, destroyed vital organs, and other grievous maiming. 
### Psyche-Cleansing Technique (+10m, 1wp; requires Trauma-Erasing Touch)
The stylist can lower a Derangement’s intensity one step, to a minimum of Minor, by forgoing (its intensity) levels of healing. She can negate a Psyche effect by forgoing of healing equal to the higher of the Essence of the character responsible or the total Willpower cost to resist it.
