The Lawgiver inverts Spirit-Repelling Diagram, creating a pattern that binds a spirit in place. This Essence diagram forms around a target up to two range bands from the Solar. An intricate pattern in the diagram traps and binds the spirit’s Essence, sealing it within the mandala. Pay the cost of this Charm once and roll the Solar’s (Wits + Occult) against a difficulty of the spirit’s Essence. If successful, the spirit is bound on the spot for a number of turns equal to (extra successes + 1), upon which the Solar must roll (Wits + Occult) against the spirit’s Essence to maintain the cage. Each time the Solar succeeds at this contest, the binding effect is extended as above, but the difficulty also increases by one on each subsequent attempt. During this time, the Solar may approach the spirit, but if she moves more than two range bands away from it, the mandala fades and the spirit is freed. An immaterial spirit trapped in the Spirit-Caging Mandala may be perceived by characters who cannot normally see spirits, and may be struck by characters who cannot normally strike immaterial foes. As the spirit is rendered incapable of moving across range bands, spirits trapped in the cage can only attack characters outside the diagram if they have the ability to attack at range, and only then if they are attacked first. Foes who enter the mandala at close range are always fair game.
