The [[Night Hag’s Braid]] lashes the cursed with ferocious intensity, bringing their fever dreams to an end.
When the wielder makes a decisive attack against a cursed enemy, she adds dice equal to her banked curse points on the damage roll or on a gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll.
She can spend curse points to add that many additional dice. On gambits, each curse point spent this way also counts as one [[Initiative]] toward the gambit’s cost.
If the wielder incapacitates her target, she’s refunded all curse points spent on the attack. Against a nontrivial enemy, she banks (his [[Essence]]) additional curse points.
## Resonant
The wielder can use this Evocation to make a decisive attack while crashed. She doesn’t add the damage bonus for banked curse points, only those that she spends. She must spend at least one curse point.
This attack doesn’t include or reset her [[Initiative]].
## Dissonant
This Evocation’s base damage bonus can’t exceed five dice, and the wielder can’t spend more than five curse points to add additional damage.

## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by banking 3+ curse points from a single roll.
