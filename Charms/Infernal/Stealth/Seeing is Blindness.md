*The Infernal strips away her enemies’ sight, trailing eddies of liquid darkness as she strikes.*

If the Infernal deals 3+ damage with a decisive attack, she may forgo one level of damage to blind her target for the rest of the scene. He suffers a −3 penalty on all vision-based rolls as his eyes darken to pure black. This penalty subtracts successes instead of dice from rolls opposing the Infernal’s Stealth. The Infernal doesn’t need to forgo damage if she uses this Charm on an unexpected attack.

With Stealth 4, Essence 2, victims are blinded for (Infernal’s Essence) hours, or (Essence) days for mortals and First Circle demons.
## [[Keys]]
#### See No More (Stealth 4)
The Infernal doesn’t need to forgo damage to blind her target. On unexpected attacks, she only needs to deal one level of damage to blind him. With Essence 5, the Infernal can use [[#Night Falls Swiftly (Stealth 5, Essence 2)|Night Falls Swiftly]] without forgoing damage.
#### Blindness is Sight (Stealth 4, Essence 2) (+3m)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote surcharge to appropriate a blinded enemy’s misplaced sight. As long as he’s blinded, the Infernal can see from his perspective by closing her eyes. She makes Awareness rolls to see using her own dice pools and can use Charms as normal, but can’t use any senses other than sight. The Infernal can change between viewpoints as a reflexive action.
#### Night Falls Swiftly (Stealth 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal can use this Charm after the damage roll if she forgoes an additional level of damage. She still doesn’t need to forgo any damage for unexpected attacks.
