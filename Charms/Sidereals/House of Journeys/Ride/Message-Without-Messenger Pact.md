The world sees the Sidereal as nothing more than an extension of her obligations, a mysterious figure bound by a pact signed in blood. When the Sidereal uses Messenger’s Oath, she may pay an aggravated health level to grant her and any mount she rides the following benefits: 
-  Their appearance is obscured; others perceive them as a rider and mount suitable for what they understand her obligation to be. This works like a resplendent destiny (p. XX), suppressing the Sidereal’s arcane fate, but doesn’t count against the limit on them. 
-  Rolls against them to discover information unrelated to the obligation suffer +1 target number. They can oppose scrying, Divination Charms, and similar magic that’s normally unrolled, rolling (Manipulation + Ride) against an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll. 
-  If an opposing character fails a roll to scry on one of them, the Sidereal may pay one Willpower to make him believe he succeeded, providing false information that would be true of whomever issued her the task. 
-  Her Auspicious Prospects for (Caste) reveal whether something will benefit or hinder her task, rather than whether they align with destiny.
