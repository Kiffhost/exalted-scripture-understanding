*The Infernal’s eyes burn with an emerald light, subsuming her irises in hateful radiance.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- She adds two dice on vision-based Awareness rolls. The Storyteller should give her wide leeway in stunting incredible feats, albeit potentially at high difficulties, like counting a parade of demon’s congregants or following things that would normally be too fast for the human eye to see clearly.
- Her visual range is greatly increased, allowing her to make out tiny details at three hundred feet.
- She reduces any penalties she suffers from poor lighting by two.
- Her blazing eyes add (Perception/2, rounded up) dice on threaten rolls against those who can see them, but impose a penalty in the same amount on her Stealth rolls. Both the bonus and the penalty are halved if the Infernal covers one (or most) of her eyes, such as with an eyepatch.

This Charm lasts one scene for three motes or indefinitely for six motes, one Willpower.
### Keys 
#### I See All (Awareness 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal adds one die to this Charm’s bonus on Awareness rolls and threaten rolls, but increases the penalty on Stealth rolls by one as well. She can fine details clearly up to a mile away. Even in zero-visibility environments, she can make out visual details, suffering only a −1 penalty.
