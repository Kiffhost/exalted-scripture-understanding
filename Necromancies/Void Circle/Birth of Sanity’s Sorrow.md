*Drowning in shadow of utmost black, the necromancer emerges transformed into a monstrosity that reflects her darkest impulses — strong as sorrow, fleet as fear, armored in tragedy and abhorrence.*
The necromancer undergoes a grotesque transformation, marking her as an avatar of death. She gains four of the following powers or traits, chosen when she first learns this spell.
Blood is drawn to the necromancer, knitting her wounds and quickening her fury. She gains two temporary −0 health levels, which are the first to be damaged and which heal at the start of each turn. Once per round, when a living character within medium range suffers decisive damage, she can heal one level of non-aggravated damage or gain (2 + target’s base wound penalty) Initiative.
### Blood-Forged Body
The necromancer’s form swells with meaty sinew. She gains two bonus dots of Strength, which can raise her above 5. She can make a reflexive feat of strength with a free full Excellency once on each of her turns.
### Cataclysm Mantle
The necromancer is wreathed in balefire and void-stuff. This is an environmental hazard that extends out to short range, with difficulty 5 and Damage 5L/round. Trivial characters are always slain instantly.
### Fivefold Slaughter Harbinger
The necromancer can reflexively make an attack against an enemy battle group or all trivial enemies within range of her weapon once on each of her turns. She can reflexively activate a Simple Charm that creates an attack for this attack.
### Hundred-Armed Horror
The necromancer grows multiple appendages of flesh, shadow, or Essence. She rolls (Wits + Occult) to Join Battle, establishing a new Initiative track. She still takes only one turn per round but can use either track interchangeably when determining her turn, taking damage, paying costs, or gaining Initiative. If she lands a decisive attack, she resets the track she made the attack with.
### Legendary Size
The necromancer gains the Legendary Size Merit (p. XX).
### Monstrous Mien
The necromancer gains 2 bonus dots of Appearance, which can raise her above 5, and gains the Hideous Merit. She doesn’t suffer penalties for flurrying attacks with influence rolls. If she hits an enemy with an attack, he suffers −2 Resolve against her next influence roll against him that scene. Likewise, successful influence rolls penalize Defense against her attacks.
### Singularity of Purpose
The silence of the void quiets the necromancer’s mind. She treats any influence that would cause her to stand down, lessen her attack, or hesitate as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). Once per scene, she may reduce the Willpower cost of resisting influence or using a Charm or similar effect by one.
Once per story, when the necromancer’s Incapacitated health level is filled with damage, she may reflexively cast this spell, rolling (current temporary Willpower + Essence) to gather necromantic motes. She can spend her own motes as if they were necromantic motes toward the spell’s cost. If she gathers enough to cast the spell, she also heals her Incapacitated level and gains (Essence) additional −0 health levels. These levels are the first to be damaged and are lost when filled. If she survives the scene, she cannot regain Willpower through sleep for seven days, wracked by nightmares of her own near-destruction.
## Control
The necromancer may choose an additional feature for her transformation. Spirits of Creation automatically sense her potential for annihilation, and count as having a Minor Tie of hatred towards her.
## Distortion (15)
A rival may siphon away some of the necromancer’s terrible power, deactivating one of this spell’s special abilities of their choice. This spell may be distorted multiple times, deactivating a different ability each time.
