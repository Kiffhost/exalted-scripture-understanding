*The Sidereal sees her enemy’s true face revealed in his strategy.*
The Sidereal ignores penalties on a Strategic Maneuver roll for being unfamiliar with an enemy general or forces. If her roll beats the opposing general’s Guile, her player may ask the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every three extra successes over his Guile
- What’s his motivation for fighting?
- What should I watch out for in the coming battle?
- What are his forces’ greatest weakness?
- Which of my positive Ties does he pose the greatest threat to?
The Sidereal gains this benefit even if the enemy general won the opposed Strategic Maneuver roll.
If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
