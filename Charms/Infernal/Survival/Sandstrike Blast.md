*The Infernal calls forth the fury of the wastes to enact her judgment upon the unrighteous.*

The Infernal rolls ({Charisma or Perception} + Survival) to make a withering or decisive attack against an enemy within medium range. Many call forth a burst of lacerating sand, like that of the Endless Desert, though others invoke different aspects of Hell’s alien, inhospitable wilderness: carnivorous demon-flora, acidic brume, barbed metal foliage, and the like. Whatever form it takes, this blast has the following traits:
- The Accuracy of an artifact Archery weapon: Close −1; Short +5; Medium +3; Long +1; Extreme −1.
- Damage 10L. The Infernal adds her Survival instead of her Strength to its raw withering damage.
- Overwhelming (Survival − 1).
- It can be enhanced with either Archery or Thrown Charms, but can’t combine Charms from multiple combat Abilities unless they’re explicitly compatible.
- It can’t be blocked without an artifact weapon, defensive magic, or a stunt.
- In harsh, inhospitable environs, it gains +1 Damage and Overwhelming.
## [[Keys]]
#### Oasis-Scouring Malediction
When the Infernal uses a Simple or Reflexive Charm to make an Archery or Thrown attack, she can use [[Sandstrike Blast]] reflexively to make it.
#### Dust Devil Feint (Survival 4)
The Infernal can make distract and disarm gambits. In desolate terrain, she lowers the gambit’s difficulty by one.
#### False Idols Cast Down (Survival 4) (+4m)
When an enemy within short range attacks the Infernal, she can pay a four-mote surcharge make a decisive counterattack with this Charm. If she deals damage, her attacker is knocked back one range band and falls prone. When used with [[#Dust Devil Feint (Survival 4)|Dust Devil Feint]] or [[#Hateful Wasteland Malice (Survival 4)|Hateful Wasteland Malice]], a successful gambit also triggers knockback.
#### Hateful Wasteland Malice (Survival 4)
The Infernal adds one die on damage on decisive attacks. In harsh environs, she doubles 10s on the damage roll.
#### Dune-Burst Onslaught (Survival 4, Essence 2, [[#Hateful Wasteland Malice (Survival 4)|Hateful Wasteland Malice]]) (+4i)
The Infernal can pay a four-Initiative surcharge to create a one-time environmental hazard within this Charm’s range instead of making an attack. The hazard extends out to short range from the chosen point, with difficulty (Infernal’s Survival) and Damage (Essence)L. The hazard doesn’t affect the Infernal or characters with Ties of reverence to her. She adds +1 to both difficulty and Damage in harsh, inhospitable terrain.
#### Endless Desert’s Embrace (Survival 5, [[#Dune-Burst Onslaught (Survival 4, Essence 2, Hateful Wasteland Malice (Survival 4) Hateful Wasteland Malice ) (+4i)|Dune-Burst Onslaught]]) (+2m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay an additional two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Dune-Burst Onslaught to extend the hazard’s duration to one scene. She can use her movement action to reflexively move the hazard one range band on her turn.
