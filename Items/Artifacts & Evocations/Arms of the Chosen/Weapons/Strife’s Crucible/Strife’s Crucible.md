*Strife’s Crucible is a monument to the duel — a bold form of combat with countless age-old traditions spanning Creation’s cultures. It was forged by Iron Temper, a [[Chosen of Battles]] who viewed the Usurpation as a failure of all the Exalted. We are not ready, he thought. So he petitioned the Maidens for starmetal containing remnants of Mars’s own power, and melted down a slain Lawgiver’s red jade daiklave to fashion into a pair of deadly khatars that would test the Exalted hosts. 
The starmetal blade of each gauntlet is two feet long and one foot wide but thin as a finger, gleaming opalescent in the light. The red jade gauntlets — wrapped with starmetal wire — are engraved with depictions of the constellation of that name. The khatars exult in their mission, speeding their wielder with auspicious grace when that mission is at hand. Its wielder can spur others to battle and test their mettle, while ensuring that they live to improve and fight another day. 
To this day, Iron Temper wields [[Strife’s Crucible]], traveling Creation’s many lands to challenge Exalts far and wide. He has made a sacred oath on the [[Essence]] of the weapon: When he finds the destined one worthy to take up his role—one more dedicated than he to the betterment of the Chosen whose stars rest in the Gauntlet’s palm — he will bequeath both role and Strife’s Crucible to that Exalt. Until then, he guides [[Strife’s Crucible]] in its ordained purpose.*
## [[Evocations]] of [[Strife’s Crucible]]

When the wielder rolls [[Join Battle]], she may declare one non-trivial enemy her chosen opponent. If she beats her chosen opponent’s Join Battle roll, she gains (his Essence) in [[Initiative]] and may act first that round, going before all other characters regardless of [[Initiative]] order. However, she cannot attack any character other than her chosen opponent on her first turn. If her chosen opponent beats her [[Join Battle]] roll, he receives the same benefits. When the wielder defeats her chosen opponent, she may offer to transfer one [[Willpower]] to him, pushing him to never accept defeat. If he accepts, he forms a Major [[Intimacy]] chosen by his player to reflect the lesson he’s learned from this fight.
