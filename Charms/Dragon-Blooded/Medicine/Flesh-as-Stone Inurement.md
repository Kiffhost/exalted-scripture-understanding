*The Dragon-Blood brushes her fingers across pressure points to numb her patient to pain.*
She rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Medicine]]) against a difficulty of (an ally’s wound penalty + 1). Success lets that character ignore (the Dragon-Blood’s Essence/2, rounded up) points of wound penalties for the scene. Alternatively, this Charm can be used to numb an enemy’s limb, a gambit rolled against an enemy at close range with ([[Dexterity]] + {Brawl, [[Martial Arts]], or Medicine}). Its difficulty equals (higher of the target’s [[Stamina]] or [[Resistance]]). Success imposes a −3 penalty on all actions taken with the struck appendage until the victim receives a day’s bed rest. This can be healed with magic such as [[Wound-Banishing Strike]] (Exalted, p. 343).
