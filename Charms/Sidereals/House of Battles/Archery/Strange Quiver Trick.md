*The Sidereal’s quiver is stocked with the right arrow for every eventuality.*
Reaching for ammunition on her person, the Sidereal rolls (Wits + Archery) to produce a mundane object that’s small enough to fire with Generalized Ammunition Technique with a Resources rating less than or equal to her successes. She can’t use this to steal specific objects.
## Special activation rules
This Charm can be placed in a flurry. If the Sidereal flurries it with an attack to fire the object using Generalized Ammunition Technique, uses her attack in place of this Charm’s roll.
## Reset
Once per scene.
