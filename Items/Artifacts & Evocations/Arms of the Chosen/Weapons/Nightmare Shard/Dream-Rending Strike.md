*Sometimes, a dream offers shelter from a reality too nightmarish to face.*
[[Nightmare Shard]] cuts through these as it does any other dream, revealing the awful truth. This Evocation upgrades [[Order-Affirming Blow]] (Exalted, p. 334), allowing the Solar to deliver it through a difficulty 3 [[Thrown]] gambit with a free full Excellency.
