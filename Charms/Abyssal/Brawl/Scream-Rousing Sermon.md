*Even in the depths of murderous rage, the Abyssal preaches her bleak gospel with bloodied fists and thunderous words.*
[[Dark Messiah’s Wrath]] no longer prevents the Abyssal from making influence rolls unrelated to combat so long as they inspire despair, sorrow, or other negative emotions, instill Principles that she holds or negative Ties, or leverage such emotions or Intimacies with persuade actions.
While using [[Dark Messiah’s Wrath]], the Abyssal gains +1 [[Resolve]] and adds dice equal to her wound penalty on any influence rolls she makes, maximum (highest social Attribute). Any enemy whose [[Resolve]] is beaten by an influence roll loses one [[Initiative]].
