*The Infernal lauds the violence of fellow sinners, applauding their might with her malice.*

The Infernal can pay a five-mote surcharge to use [[Life-Denying Hate]] reflexively when an enemy is reduced to (Infernal’s Essence) or fewer undamaged health levels. She can’t trigger this with her own decisive attacks. She can also use it without needing to pay a surcharge to attack an enemy when he would heal damage. Her attack is resolved first, allowing it to potentially negate the healing.

If the Infernal knows [[Despair-Choked Spirit Maiming]] (p. XX), can pay a five-mote surcharge to use it reflexively when an enemy is falls to (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) or fewer temporary Willpower. She can’t trigger this with her own uses of [[Despair-Choked Spirit Maiming]]. She can use it without needing to pay a surcharge to attack an enemy when he would gain Willpower. As above, her attack is resolved first.
## Reset
The Infernal can only use this Charm against an enemy once per round.
