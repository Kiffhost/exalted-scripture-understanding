One of the Infernal’s senses is transformed and enhanced to an extreme degree, such as a body studded with unblinking eyes. This has the following effects:
- She adds ([[Perception]]/2, rounded up) dice on rolls with the chosen sense. These dice are non-Charm if she has the [[Enhanced Sense]] mutation for that sense (Exalted, p. 165).
- She succeeds automatically on unopposed [[Perception]] rolls with a difficulty of ([[Perception]] + 2) or lower.
- She succeeds automatically on [[Perception]] rolls against mortals, First Circle demons, and trivial characters.
