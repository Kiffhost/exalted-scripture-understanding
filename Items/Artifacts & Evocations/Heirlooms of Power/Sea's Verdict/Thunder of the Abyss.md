The [[Sea’s Verdict]] strains under the pressure of its own infamous Gaol, black water spraying from every crack. The released waters unnaturally swirl above the wielder as a great maelstrom that she can collapse into a pelagic hammer blow, dissolving the trident’s silver prongs like corks popping from a bottled ocean. The wielder can end [[Gaol Without Fathom]] by inflicting a decisive slam attack on every grappled character, dividing her [[Initiative]] evenly, rounded up, between every victim. The damage ignores [[Hardness]]. She doesn’t add bonus damage for remaining turns of control. Instead, she may expend one level of Sea’s Verdict’s anima for each round she’s maintained the clinch, dealing that many levels of bashing damage to each victim. The bodies of those killed by the [[Thunder of the Abyss]] vanish, only ever found as water-bloated flotsam on some distant shore. The [[Sea’s Verdict]] reforms unscathed after using this Evocation, but its silvery chains wrap with watertight urgency, resetting its anima to dim and preventing it from growing for the rest of the scene.
