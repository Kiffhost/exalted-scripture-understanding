*The Sidereal sees the strands of fate that connect two people, sensing the emotional tenor of their relationship.*
When the Sidereal succeeds on a read intentions roll that reveals a Tie to another individual, if her successes beat the Guile of that Tie’s object, she learns what Intimacy, if any, he has for the character she read. He need not be present for her to do so.
