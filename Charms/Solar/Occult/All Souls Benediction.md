The Lawgiver speaks her authority into the world, and her words work through the moorings and bindings of Creation to bring forth spirits. Every spirit or immaterial being within six range bands must succeed at a (Wits + Dodge) check at a difficulty of ([the Solar’s current temporary Willpower] + Essence). Beings who fail this check are forced to materialize, though without paying the cost of materializing magic. Ghosts struck with All Souls Benediction have the option to go immediately into lethe to avoid facing the Lawgiver’s wrath. Creatures struck with All Souls Benediction may not dematerialize until the Lawgiver permits it, or until the scene ends.
