The characterâ€™s body possesses a reservoir of deadly venom, which can be applied through natural attacks. The standard version of this Merit requires that the character also have some other Merit or power granting him natural weaponry capable of inflicting lethal damage, such as claws, fangs, quills, a tail-barb, or the like. This allows the character to poison his enemies on a successful decisive attack up to (Stamina / 2, round up) times per day.
Alternately, if the character lacks such natural weaponry, this Merit allows him to spit a contact poison as a difficulty 3 gambit (see p. 199), aiming it as though it were a Thrown weapon. Success envenoms the target. This attack can be made up to (Stamina / 2, round up) times per day.
For four dots, a character with appropriate natural lethal weaponry may envenom his attacks and spit poison. Both attacks draw out of the same limited poison supply. Regardless, all poison supplied by this Merit has the same traits as snake venom.
