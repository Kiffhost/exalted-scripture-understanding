Drawing on the endurance of every animal she can imagine, the Lunar walks undaunted through hurricanes or plumbs the depths of the Demon City’s acid sea. She subtracts (Essence) dice from an environmental hazard’s damage. If a hazard inflicts uncountable damage (Exalted, p. 205), she may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to limit it to fifteen dice of damage against her, before applying this Charm’s benefit or other effects. While Rugged Beast Endurance is active, the Lunar waives the Willpower cost of resisting uncountable damage from sources she’s adapted to.
