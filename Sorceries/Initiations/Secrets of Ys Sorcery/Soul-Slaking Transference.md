*Tugging on the sorcerous tether that connects her to a bound demon, elemental, or raksha, the sorcerer gorges herself on her servant’s Essence.*
Once per scene, she may drain up to (her [[Willpower]] x 5) motes from a bound character who’s both materialized and at up to short range; she gains one sorcerous mote per five motes drained. The target is left enervated for the rest of the day, suffering a −2 exhaustion penalty and recovering Essence at half the normal rate.
