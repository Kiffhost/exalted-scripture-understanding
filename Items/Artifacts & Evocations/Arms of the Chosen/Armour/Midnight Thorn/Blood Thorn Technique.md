*Whenever the wearer takes non-bashing decisive damage, she may use [[Razor Bloom Barrier]] reflexively.*
If her attacker is at close range, he must succeed on a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) roll against the wearer’s ([[Essence]] + 2) or be knocked prone by the rapid growth, taking one die of decisive bashing damage that ignores [[Hardness]].
