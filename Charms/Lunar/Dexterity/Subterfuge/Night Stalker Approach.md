*Gleaning subtlety from the shadows, the Lunar darkens her soul’s light.*
She mutes all motes spent on a [[Larceny]] roll, [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] roll, or action taken in concealment. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size may learn this as a [[Manipulation]] Charm.
