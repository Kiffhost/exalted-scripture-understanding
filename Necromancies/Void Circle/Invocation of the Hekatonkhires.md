*Untold monstrosities of unique nature and power haunt the Underworld, and necromancers of the supreme exponent may summon and bind them into service through rites just as strange and varied.*
This spell represents any of a number of rites meant to conjure one of the Underworld’s undead behemoths — living mountains of gore, the ghosts of dead cities and concepts, tattered soul-husks from the Neverborn, and countless others. They’re typically comparable to Third Circle demons in raw power, making them either terrifying combatants or invaluable allies with unique magic. Each must be summoned by its own unique rite, so this spell must be purchased once for each behemoth, though purchases past the first only cost three experience.
In general, each rite requires three hours of intense effort, and ends by pitting the necromancer’s ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]] roll) against the behemoth’s (higher of [[Resolve]] or [[Essence]]). On success, the behemoth is bound to serve faithfully for (necromancer’s [[Essence]]) months, and gaining an inviolate Defining Tie of loyalty to the summoner. On failure, the behemoth may demand one serious task (Exalted, p. 216) in exchange for its service; if the necromancer accepts, she is bound to follow through as if by an [[Eclipse]] oath (Exalted, p. 176) and the behemoth gains only an Major Tie of loyalty.
Roll of the Unhallowed Mythos Elnuet-that-Was (p. XX) is provided as a ready-made example of a behemoth that a necromancer may bind with this spell.
Storytellers and players wishing to develop their own behemoths might consider the following seeds:
Umaza (p. XX), a vast leviathan whose hymns lure the living to certain death or necromantic enlightenment.
Mourning Scour is the vague outline of a maiden in a crystal casket; she knows the regrets of anyone she looks upon, and can cry tears of saltwater, arsenic, or blood sufficient to befoul almost any body of standing water.
Lamvinult, Whose Mien Is Meat, infects the skin of all it touches so it sloughs off to reveal the still-living muscle beneath, and can transform into anyone its plague has afflicted.
