The Lawgiver draws her weapon through the air, focusing [[Essence]] through her aggression. Her flesh coruscates with Solar energy which gathers around her hand and her weapon when she parries. For the rest of the scene, her parry [[Defense]] is raised by one against creatures of the night, the Abyssal Exalted, demons and the impure residents of Creation’s underways. In addition, if such creatures strike her without a weapon, they must contend with decisive damage dice equal to the Solar’s [[Essence]]. This damage ignores hardness.
