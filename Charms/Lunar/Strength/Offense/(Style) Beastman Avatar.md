The Lunar’s war-form embodies the pinnacle of the human predator’s martial prowess. Upon purchasing this Charm, she chooses a Martial Arts style that she knows every Charm of. When activating Deadly Beastman Transformation, she may reflexively activate that style’s Form for a one-Willpower surcharge. This Charm’s benefits can be extended to other styles the Lunar has fully mastered for five experience points each (four if Strength is Caste/Favored).
