This twisted zither, carved from the brass trees of Hrotsvitha, continually generates a low, meaningless drone of noise, imposing a −1 penalty on Stealth rolls even while unattuned.

When attuned for two motes, the heart-splaying zither is exceptional equipment and grants anyone who holds it an understanding of how to play it. The musician need not be the same character who attuned it. Those who play the instrument inevitably express one of their Intimacies of hunger or desire through it, willingly or no. They convert the bonus die for exceptional equipment to a non-Charm success for influence that supports that Intimacy, but suffer −2 Guile against rolls that would reveal the Intimacy.

Politically-minded demons keep heart-splaying instruments as tools of intrigue, in addition to making even their dullest First Circle servants sound like professional musicians.
