*Shining like a blood moon over the battlefield, the unstoppable Lunar general emanates an almost overwhelming spiritual pressure.*
She adds (Anima + 1) dice on [[Appearance]]-based command rolls, and allied battle groups add (Anima) dice on rout checks. Once per scene, she may reset a rally for numbers action (Exalted, p. 210) by expending three levels of anima, calling back even the most far-flung remnants of her forces. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
