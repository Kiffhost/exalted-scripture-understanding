The Lunar anoints another with her blood, granting him a measure of her infinite freedom. She grants a mortal the ability to change into an animal whose shape she possesses (other than Legendary Size or Minuscule Size shapes) for one Willpower. Other than cost, this is as per Lunar shapeshifting. Mortals use (Lunar’s Essence) as their dice cap for this Charm. If the Lunar and recipient both have positive Major or Defining Ties toward each other, reduce this Charm’s cost by one mote. A Lunar with Endless Masquerade Affliction can grant human forms this way.
