*The Lunar’s words seep into the mind like corrosive acid, burning away the burden of understanding.*
She makes a special written or spoken ([[Manipulation]] + {Linguistics, [[Presence]], or Socialize}) instill roll against one character. Success removes his knowledge of all languages, rendering him unable to employ or understand spoken or written communication. The victim’s freedom from language gives him an affinity for animals. Animals don’t receive a [[Resolve]] bonus against his influence rolls when he communicates through body language, nor does he receive a [[Resolve]] bonus when animals do so against him. 
The victim may pay one [[Willpower]] to regain understanding of a single language for a scene. Once he’s done so (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) times, this influence ends. Otherwise, it lasts until this Charm ends. 
With Essence 5, this Charm’s duration extends to Indefinite.
