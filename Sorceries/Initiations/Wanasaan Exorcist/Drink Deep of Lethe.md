*By compelling a ghost to abandon its unnatural existence and return to the cycle of reincarnation, the sorcerer may breathe in the remnants of its Essence.*
After incapacitating a ghost or similar shade or using [[Social Influence]] to convince it to pass on (a life-defining task, Exalted p. 216), she rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Occult]]) with (the ghost’s [[Essence]]) bonus dice, gaining [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Motes|sorcerous motes]] equal to the successes. These motes last until the story’s end, although she cannot stock more than ([Essence + Willpower] x4) sorcerous motes with this ritual at a time.
