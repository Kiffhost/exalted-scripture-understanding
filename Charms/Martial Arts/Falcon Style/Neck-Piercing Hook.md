*The stylist hooks her foe’s neck with one leg and spins in mid-air, sending him flying on wings of deadly force.*
She throws a grappled enemy out to short range. Upon impact, he rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) at a difficulty equal to the rounds of control the stylist expended. On failure, the stylist makes a second damage roll, rolling dice equal to the first damage roll’s successes. This ignores soak and [[Hardness]].
With [[Essence]] 3, the stylist can throw enemies out to medium range, at the cost of halving the damage she rolls if her enemy fails, rounded up. 
## Terrestrial
The second damage roll can’t exceed (stylist’s [[Strength]] + 10s on the first damage roll) dice.
