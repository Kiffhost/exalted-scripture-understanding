*Delving into the depths of nightmare, the Abyssal emerges haunted by what she has witnessed.*
The Abyssal enters a fugue-like trance, gaining a temporary [[Lore]] specialty from the forbidden knowledge her waking nightmares reveal. The specialty must involve death, the undead, the Underworld, ancestor worship, disease, poison, or other subjects thematically appropriate to the [[Abyssal Exalted]].
The Abyssal’s eerie half sleep also grants her +1 [[Guile]], as well as +1 [[Resolve]] against influence unrelated to the [[Lore]] specialty. However, she suffers a −1 penalty on [[Perception]]-based rolls that don’t involve the specialty.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal may invoke her [[Whispers]] to change the chosen specialty as her waking nightmares shift and distort.
