The Lunar’s soul-jewel brings her into harmony with the world’s [[Essence]].
The Lunar gains the following benefits:  - If she knows Radiant Basilic Jewel’s hearthstone counts as being socketed in all artifacts she’s attuned to for all purposes: enhancing weapons, powering warstriders, enabling dependent hearthstones, etc. This doesn’t use up a socket.
 - She doubles 9s on non-extended [[Craft]], [[Lore]], or [[Occult]] rolls with any Attribute that involve geomancy — demesnes, manses, hearthstones, dragon lines, etc. Double 8s for Lunar geomancy.
 - Attuning a demesne lasts indefinitely as long as she bears its hearthstone. If someone attempts to sever her attunement (Exalted, p. 161), their roll is opposed by her ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]). Success preserves her attunement and alerts her, but doesn’t reveal the opposing character’s identity.
 - If she knows [[Devil’s Hidden Footprints]] (Lunars, p. 249), she can spend extra successes on rolls to sense [[Essence]] use within an attuned demesne or manse to apply that Charm’s benefits. This also applies on opposed rolls to preserve her attunement.
