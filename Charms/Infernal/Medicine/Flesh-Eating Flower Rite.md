*The Infernal feeds a sampling of her flesh to a patient, planting the seed of a monstrous transformation.*

The Infernal transforms a mortal, Demon-Blood, or First Circle demon who’s either willing or helpless by feeding him of herself, causing alien flora to blossom within him. He gains the following benefits:
- He can consume meat for sustenance, but not any other foods.
- He gains a bite attack, a heavy weapon with the Brawl, Grappling, and Lethal tags and Overwhelming (Infernal’s Essence + 1). For Quick Characters, it has a base attack pool of (Infernal’s Essence + 7) dice and Damage (Infernal’s Essence + 10)L.
- He gains six dots of mutations chosen by the Infernal to reflect him becoming as much a plant as an animal.
- He adds three dice on Awareness, Investigation, and Survival rolls to detect or examine things he can eat.

This transformation can be cured as if it were a crippling injury by removing the infestation of plants.

In addition to this transformation, the target gains a Defining Principle of “my hunger must be sated.” He can pay three Willpower to voluntarily weaken it by one step, but it can’t be weakened or altered by any other means. As long as he has it, he must sate his hunger by feeding on anything recently dead or still-living that he can consume until he’s had his fill. This doesn’t apply to humans and other intelligent life, or to animals that he has a positive Tie toward, unless he suffers a penalty from starvation (Exalted, p. 232). He can spend one Willpower to resist his hunger for day.
