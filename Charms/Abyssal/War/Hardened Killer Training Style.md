*The Abyssal tempers raw recruits in a crucible of brutality, refining them into living — and unliving — weapons.*
The Abyssal spends a week training a battle group to grant its members the traits of battle-ready troops (Exalted, p. 496), where better than their own, and increase its [[Drill]] to average. Alternatively, she can spend a month training a battle group with average [[Drill]] to grants its members elite troop traits (Exalted, p. 497) and raise its [[Drill]] to elite.
With [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal can spend a month training a battle group with elite [[Drill]] to grant one of the following benefits. Any experience points spent on these benefits are refunded if the enhanced battle group is slain.
Legion of Life’s End: For three experience points, the Abyssal grants a battle group +1 [[Might]] when facing opposition from mortals or battle groups made up of the living. If it has [[Might]] 0, the bonus increases to +2.
Soul-Numbing Prowess: For three experience points, the Abyssal grants the battle group perfect morale (Exalted, p. 210), breaking their fear by confronting them with death’s inevitability.
Warlord of Death’s Dominion: For three experience points, the Abyssal grants a battle group +1 [[Might]] while in shadowlands and the Underworld. If it has [[Might]] 0, the bonus increases to +2.
