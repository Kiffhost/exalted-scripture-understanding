*The Sidereal can’t always wait on for a foretold hero and a destined blade; sometimes, she must manufacture both.*
The Sidereal imbues one of her resplendent destinies into a mundane object that can be held or worn, which must relate to the destiny’s role or its constellation’s trappings. The Sidereal can’t don the resplendent destiny while it’s imbued, but it still counts against her limit.
The imbued object takes on a semblance more suited to the destiny’s roll and becomes an artifact, though it doesn’t become indestructible. (Non-weapon, non-armor artifacts typically have an attunement cost of two motes and have an attunement bonus comparable to those of other artifacts.) Those who wield or wear the artifact are wreathed in its resplendent destiny, suppressing those of other Sidereals. [[Evocations]] can be awakened from the imbued destiny, based on its role and constellation and the Sidereal’s Caste. Sidereals are resonant with them; other characters treat them as exotic materials (Arms of the Chosen, p. 15). If the imbued object is destroyed, characters can still use awakened [[Evocations]] if the Sidereal imbues the same resplendent destiny in another object. As long as a character’s awakened an Evocation for that resplendent destiny, the destiny never fades at the end of a story and can’t be magically destroyed, though the Sidereal can voluntarily end it. If she does, or if she dies or otherwise leaves the narrative, player characters are refunded experience spent on these [[Evocations]]. The Sidereal can use this Charm multiple times to imbue multiple objects with a resplendent destiny. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset when another character uses the imbued object to achieve a major character or story goal.
