The Dragon-Blood cauterizes wounds with flame-wreathed hands, searing flesh and saving lives. When she uses [[Wound-Closing Technique]] to convert lethal damage to bashing, she may pay a surcharge of two motes or two [[Initiative]] to complete the treatment instantly, doubling 9s on the roll. Her cauterizing touch also automatically staunches her patient’s wounds (Exalted, p. 174) and prevents his wounds from becoming infected (Exalted, p. 235). However, the pain of this procedure increases her patient’s wound penalty by –1 for (6 – patient’s [[Stamina]]) rounds.
Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood may pay a two-mote or two-[[Initiative]] surcharge to use [[Wound-Closing Technique]] to make a rally for numbers roll with ([[Intelligence]] + [[War]]), adding ([[Medicine]]) non-Charm dice, quickly patching her soldiers’ wounds to get them back on their feet.
Uses of [[Wound-Closing Technique]] enhanced by this Charm are Fire Aspected.
