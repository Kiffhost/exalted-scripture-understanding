Skillfully concealing all signs of her passage, the Dragon-Blood may tread over twigs without snapping them and walk through grass without bending a blade. She doubles 9s on a [[Survival]] roll to conceal her tracks or on a [[Stealth]] roll to establish concealment in a forest, grassland, or similar wilderness. The Dragon-Blood may learn elemental variants of this Charm that function in different terrain for three experience points each. Air: This variant can be used in snowfall, or amid snow-covered or icy terrain. Earth: This variant can be used underground, or in mountainous or other rocky terrain. Fire: This variant can be used in widespread fire or smoke, or amid deserts or active volcanic terrain. Water: This variant can be used in rainfall, near bodies of water, or amid marshy or swampy terrain.
