*The legends of fearsome monsters, noble outlaws, and ancient heroes take on a life of their own through the Dragon-Blood.*
She waives Terrifying Forest-Devil Mask’s [[Willpower]] cost if she uses it to assume a role that she’s previously taken with it.
Additionally, the Dragon-Blood’s masks draw power from their legend, slowly transforming into artifacts.
This transformation is represented by the mask gaining Mystique, which occurs under the following circumstances.
 - Once per session, when the Dragon-Blood upholds the [[Intimacy]] conferred by the mask, it gains 1 Mystique.
 - Once per session, when a narratively significant character forms or upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] C hapt er S i x: C ha r ms toward the role embodied by the mask, it gains 1 Mystique.
 - When the Dragon-Blood completes a major character or story goal that aligns with the [[Intimacy]] conferred by the mask, it gains 1 Mystique.
 - When the Dragon-Blood achieves a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) that aligns with the [[Intimacy]] conferred by the mask, it gains 5 Mystique.
 - Once per story, when the Dragon-Blood defeats an enemy in a fashion that aligns with the [[Intimacy]] conferred by the mask — potentially in combat, but including other forms of defeat such as humiliating him in front of his admirers or driving his merchant enterprise bankrupt — it gains (his [[Essence]]) Mystique, maximum 5.
Once a mask accrues 50 Mystique, it becomes a threedot artifact, with [[Evocations]] based on both the legend that’s formed around the role it depicts and any magical materials it’s composed of. The Dragon-Blood may incorporate jade or another magical material into the mask to complete this process to gain greater resonance with its [[Evocations]]; this requires no roll. She immediately awakens one of the mask’s [[Evocations]] at no experience point cost.
The Dragon-Blood can only have one mask in the process of accruing Mystique at a time.
