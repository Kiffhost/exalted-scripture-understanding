Having meditated on the nature of silence, the Dragon-Blood directs her enlightenment inward, suffusing her anima banner with the subtlety of air. She may pay two motes to apply the Mute keyword to any Air or Balanced Charm she uses. The Dragon-Blood can master this Charm for other elements for three experience points each. She cannot mute multiple Charms of different elements in a single instant (excluding Balanced Charms).
