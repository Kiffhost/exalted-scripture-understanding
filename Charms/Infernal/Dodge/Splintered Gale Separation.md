*The Infernal’s fleeting whims are more real than most people will ever be, pouring out from her mouth to take form in a soundless scream of bloody vapor.*

The Infernal splinters off a mortal duplicate of herself. It’s fully independent and has the following traits:
- It has the Infernal’s Attributes, Abilities, Willpower, specialties, and Innate Merits.
- It has the Infernal’s base health track, not including extra levels from [[Hardened Demon Flesh]].
- It has Essence 1, no mote pool, and no anima banner. It can’t use the Infernal’s Charms or other magic.
- It has the Infernal’s Intimacies, plus a Defining Tie toward the Infernal chosen by her player. This Tie can’t be weakened or altered.
- It appears with functional copies of the Infernal’s equipment. Artifacts are replaced by superficially identical but mundane equivalents. This equipment dissipates if separated from the duplicate for more than a scene.
- Observers can’t tell the duplicate from the Infernal with read intentions actions unless they enhance the roll with magic or use superhuman senses.
- It can travel up to (Essence) miles from the Infernal. If it goes any further, it dissipates into wind.
- The Infernal can touch it and end this Charm to absorb it, gaining its memories.

The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively after dodging an attack, creating a duplicate and reflexively roll Stealth to enter concealment. Characters who fail the roll believe the duplicate is the true Infernal, and vice versa.

This Charm can be stacked to create up to (Essence + 5) duplicates.
## Keys
#### Abandoning Weakness (Essence 3) (+2i or +4i)
The Infernal can pay a two-Initiative surcharge to transfer one level of non-aggravated damage from her health track to that of a newly-created duplicate. The surcharge increase to four Initiative if she has a −2 or higher wound penalty.
#### Adrian Falls, Adorjan Remains (Essence 5; [[#Abandoning Weakness (Essence 3) (+2i or +4i)|Abandoning Weakness]]) (20m, 1wp)
Once per story, the Infernal can pay twenty motes, one Willpower when she would be killed, dissolving into wind and taking over the body of her nearest duplicate within the same realm of existence. If the duplicate is within long range, she reforms at the end of her next turn, healing any damage to her Incapacitated level. Her equipment doesn’t carry over with her. If the duplicate is further away, it takes her one hour for each mile between them. This can be averted by slaying the duplicate before the Infernal remanifests.
