*A jagged spike of bismuth unfurls itself in the sorcerer’s grasp, undulating with alien geometries. It pierces not the flesh, but the soul, pinning victims in place and tethering them to it by the gory entrails of their own spirit.*

The sorcerer makes an unblockable difficulty 3 (Wits + Occult) gambit against a character within short range. She can use Melee instead of Occult at close range, or Thrown beyond that. The attack can strike dematerialized creatures.

If the gambit succeeds, the spike is magically anchored in place, sympathetically tethering the victim to it by his own maimed soul. If he moves further than long range from it, he begins to suffocate (Exalted, p. 232), even if he does not normally need to breathe, and cannot regain motes by any means. Characters with Essence 3+ can go up to (Essence) miles away before suffering this.

The spike can be removed with a difficulty (5 + sorcerer’s Essence) feat of strength that requires Strength 5+, though the victim must still remain within range of it or suffer the consequences. A character can destroy it outright to end this spell, but doing so increases the difficulty and Strength minimum by two. A character who attempts a feat and rolls fewer than five successes suffers one die of aggravated damage as the spike briefly extrudes a jagged limb in retribution.
# Control
The sorcerer’s nails take on a shifting bismuth hue. She treats her victim’s Essence as 2 lower to determine how far he may move from the spike, and she can meditate to displace her senses to the spike’s location, perceiving her surroundings out to medium range from it.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
The target treats his Essence as 2 higher to determine how far he can move from the spike. The difficulty of feats to remove (but not destroy) the spike is reduced by (distorting sorcerer’s Essence).
