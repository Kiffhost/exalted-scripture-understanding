*Swords and arrows turn aside at the last moment as the sash cinches tight around the wearer’s waist, heavy with knotted misfortune.*
The welder can use this Evocation after being hit by a decisive attack, but before the damage roll. She subtracts up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice from the damage roll, paying one mote per die. 
The negated damage is converted into bad luck in the wearer’s future, taking a form of the Storyteller’s choice. This occurs at some point after the scene but before the end of the story, based on the number of dice subtracted:

| Health Levels Transformed | Effect                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 or 2                    | Small twists of fate that inflict a −2 penalty, such as unusual traffic, awful weather, misplaced papers, etc.                                       |
| 3 or 4                    | Temporary, personal setbacks, such as the theft of an important document, the arrival of an unexpected investigator, or mistaken identity.           |
| 5 or more                 | Significant trouble, often for the character’s [[Merits]], such as seized assets, incapacitated contacts, or misunderstandings that sour a relationship. |
This foretold misfortune can’t be negated or subverted by magic or any other means.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by taking damage enough damage to increase the wearer’s wound penalty to −2 or higher
## Resonant
This subtracts damage roll successes instead of dice.
