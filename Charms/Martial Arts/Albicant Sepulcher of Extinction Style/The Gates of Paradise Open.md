*The bleak saint unleashes eight blasphemous palms that shatter the cycle of Lethe, darkening the sky overhead as a storm of souls fills the battlefield.*
The stylist may pay a fifteen-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharges when she uses this style’s Form, filling the battleground with swirling souls wrenched free from Lethe as she reveals the apex of this style’s forbidden power. This soulstorm extends to extreme range from the stylist, going one range band beyond long range. It has the following effects:
 - Within the soulstorm, the battlefield counts as a shadowland.
 - The stylist gains an additional mote at the end of each round from devouring the souls that drift around her.
 - When a nontrivial enemy is lethally incapacitated within the soulstorm, the stylist gains (his [[Essence]]) motes as she devours his soul, permanently destroying spirits. Likewise, when a battle group loses [[Size]], she gains one mote. She can’t gain more than ([[Essence]] x2) motes per round this way.
 - While using [[Cerements of Forsaken Flesh]], she can continue to fight on even after she’s been incapacitated, letting her act normally and rendering her immune to further decisive damage. This ends if she’s crashed.
 - When she uses [[The Gift All Life Is Given]], [[Keening Netherworld Wail]], or [[The Pit That None Escape]], she can pay a five-mote surcharge to extend their range to encompass the entire soulstorm. When used with [[The Pit That None Escape]], she must pay this cost again at the start of each turn, but the motes aren’t committed.
