This weapon is essentially a sling on a shaft between three and five feet long. When the wielder swings the shaft, the sling releases its stone with greater force than a normal sling. By taking an additional aim action before firing, this weaponâ€™s range can be extended to long for one attack.
This aim action provides no benefit beyond enabling longrange attacks.
