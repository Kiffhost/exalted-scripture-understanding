As the bloodstained moon eclipses the sun, the dark of night swallows up the day. The living look up to the baleful omen hanging in the sky, holding their breath as they silently pray for it to pass. Such is grandeur of the Moonshadow Caste. They are envoys of the end, harbingers of doom who speak in honeyed words. They stand at the crossroads of life and death in a darkness that is neither day nor night, bringing together the living and the undead. 
The Children of Dust are masters of diplomacy and manipulation, silver-tongued schemers versed in the etiquette of both [[Creation]] and the [[Underworld]]. As emissaries and ambassadors of the [[Deathlords]], they conduct negotiations with neighboring powers, traveling to the courts of foreign powers to forge binding treaties that seem to benefit both sides. Secretly, they sow discord and foment upheaval, rendering communities both living and dead vulnerable to their Deathlord’s plots. Some are tasked with preserving order within their liege’s domain, arbitrating disputes among the Deathlord’s servants and subjects. 
The [[Deathlords]] often seek their Moonshadow Castes from those gifted in deception: demagogues peddling lies to the masses, treacherous courtiers skilled in palace intrigue, double-dealing power brokers. Even the pettiest of deceptions might catch a Deathlord’s eye: the child who lies to avoid her parents’ wrath, the rake who feigns love for her paramours, the merchant with crooked scales. Other Webspinners are chosen for their skill in shaping societies or overseeing complex affairs of state, like pitiless tyrants, bureaucratic functionaries, leaders of cultural movements. 
Some renegade Moonshadows seek to create a better world, one that has no place for their Deathlord — and perhaps, no place for the dead. Among the living, they often work through envoys, proxies, and agents, manipulating affairs in Creation from the Underworld’s shadows. Among the dead, they can proclaim their authority openly as Death’s Lawgivers, excising corruption and unjust laws like a cancer. Some seek to rally opposition against their former liege, forging coalitions between unlikely allies and sabotaging the Deathlord’s diplomatic relations.
# Anima Banner
Webspinners’ Caste Marks are an inversion of the Eclipse Caste’s: a black disc within a black ring that bleeds from its edges. A Moonshadow Caste’s anima banner is typically colored with translucent grays and blacks, sometimes glimmering with faint pale purple and green. It’s sometimes accompanied by the sound of clinking chains or scratching quills, or by sickly-sweet scents of pomegranates, perfume, or honey.

# Anima Effects
- Death’s Emissary (Permanent): While conducting diplomacy or other legitimate business with spirits or the Fair Folk, the Webspinner and her companions are protected by ancient pacts, requiring her hosts to observe local customs of hospitality and preventing them from attacking her or her entourage. If the Moonshadow or one of her companions breaks the peace first, they lose this protection. 
- Keeper of the Old Laws (10m, 1wp; Reflexive; Instant): When the Moonshadow hears someone make a promise or swear an oath, she may invoke the Old Laws to seal the pact. She may manifest her Caste Mark and anima banner in a brief display if she wishes. Those who violate the pact suffer consequences chosen by the Storyteller, often a punishment that reflects the nature of their violation. 
- Unworldly Emissary Secrets (Permanent): The Moonshadow can learn Eclipse Charms for eight experience or four bonus points each
# Caste Abilities
As ambassadors and diplomats of the Underworld, Moonshadow Castes choose Caste Abilities from Bureaucracy, Integrity, Linguistics, Occult, Presence, Ride, Sail, and Socialize.
#### ^Note:
The [[Martial Arts]] Ability cannot be chosen as Caste or Favored—instead, any character with [[Brawl]] as a chosen Caste or Favored Ability treats [[Martial Arts]] as Caste or Favored as well. A player may choose [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] as her [[Dawn]] Caste character’s Supernal Ability, but applies the benefits of that choice only to one or the other. Also, characters with [[Martial Arts]] dots must possess the [[Martial Artist]] Merit.
