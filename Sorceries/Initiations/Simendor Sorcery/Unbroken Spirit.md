*Like the rogue gods she emulates, the sorcerer draws power from opposing other's will.*
Once per scene, when she successfully asserts her [[Resolve]] against social influence or another effect, she gains ([[Integrity]]) sorcerous motes, which last until the scene ends. If the character she resisted has a higher [[Essence]] than her, she gains additional sorcerous motes equal to the difference in their [[Essence]] ratings.
