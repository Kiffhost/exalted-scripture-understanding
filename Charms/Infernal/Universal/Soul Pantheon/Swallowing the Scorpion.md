*The Infernal has fully consumed her unwoven coadjutor, subsuming it into her being as a new and nascent soul.*

The Infernal’s unwoven coadjutor (p. XX) awakens to consciousness or coherence, acting as an inner, guiding voice. For some, this is literal, mentally conversing with their coadjutor. For others, it acts as a wordless intuition, an unconscious link to the Essence of Hell. The coadjutor’s becomes an emanation of the Infernal’s soul rather than a creation of its demonic progenitor.

Once per scene, the Infernal may call on her coadjutor for one of the following benefits:
- The coadjutor freely shares its knowledge of Hell, granting the Infernal a Lore specialty in a related topic for the rest of the scene.
- The coadjutor notices threats that the Infernal might not, adding two dice on Join Battle rolls and Awareness rolls to detect hidden threats for the rest of the scene.
- The coadjutor guides the Infernal in interactions with demons, adding two dice on influence roll to read intentions roll against demons for the rest of the scene.
- As an aspect of the Infernal, her coadjutor knows her true self. Its voice reminds her of this, granting +1 Resolve against an influence roll that opposes one of her Defining Intimacies or a Psyche effect.
