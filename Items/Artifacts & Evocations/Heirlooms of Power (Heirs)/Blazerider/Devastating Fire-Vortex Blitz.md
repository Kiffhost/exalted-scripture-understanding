## Resonant
This Evocation can only be awakened by characters resonant with Blazerider.
Wheeling through the sky, Blazerider’s master ignites a deadly tornado of fire. To use this Evocation, she must have Initiative 20+ and be at medium range above the ground or a similar surface. She flies in a wide circle around a point within short range, whipping up a fiery vortex. This counts as her move action, although her movement ends where she began. This environmental hazard extends out to short range from the central point on the ground, and out to medium range at short and medium range above that point, and it burns until the end of the round. Other than this, the hazard is identical to that created by Dragon’s Blazing Wake, including the ability to enhance it with Bellows-Pumping Stride. The wielder is immune to this hazard.
When the wielder activates Flying Dragon Fang, she may make decisive attacks against up to (Essence) enemies that fail their roll against the hazard, dividing her Initiative evenly among each hit enemy to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring Hardness.
These attacks can be made against enemies at medium range or further without aiming.
For each nontrivial enemy incapacitated by this Evocation — either by the hazard or the wielder’s decisive attacks — the fire tornado continues to burn for an additional round.
This Evocation resets the wielder’s Initiative once completed, even if she didn’t make a successful decisive attack.
This Evocation can only be used once per day.
