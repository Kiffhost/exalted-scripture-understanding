*All courage dies in the presence of Death’s Chosen.*
The Abyssal can only use this Charm while [[Heart-Stopping Mien]] is active, and doing so ends that Charm.
She adds ([[Essence]]) dice on [[threaten]] rolls with a single target, and can use fear-based influence against characters who are normally immune to it. In combat, enemies lose one [[Initiative]] at the end of each round in which they didn’t attack her.
This Charm’s mote cost can’t be muted.
With [[Essence]] 5, if the Abyssal reaches bonfire anima while this Charm is active, she may use [[Heart-Stopping Mien]] for free. Enemies who’ve previously resisted it lose their immunity, though they regain it if they resist a second time.
