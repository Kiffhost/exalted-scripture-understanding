*Screaming phantoms emerge to gather up the Abyssal’s scattered armor, girding her for bloody slaughter.*
The Abyssal can [[Donning & Removing Armor|don or remove armor]] in (its mobility penalty + 1) rounds, aided by spectral apparitions. She can draw her armor to her from within short range, though she can’t steal other character’s armor.
With a [[Resistance]] 3, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a three-mote surcharge to use this Charm reflexively on her turn, [[Donning & Removing Armor|donning armor]] instantly. The surcharge is reduced to one mote for light armor. If she knows [[Wraith-Forged Plate]], she can use it reflexively, without needing to pay a surcharge.
