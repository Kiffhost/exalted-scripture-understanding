*The sister’s final wish was to never fail in her duty again.*

Second Sister has a health track with two −0 health levels. Whenever the wearer takes decisive damage, these health levels are filled first. Each level of damage in Second Sister’s health track reduces its soak by one as stylized wounds appear worked into the form of the armor as though they were always there, like artfully engraved lacerations and intricately embossed rivulets of metal blood.

Second Sister heals at a rate of one level of bashing damage per hour, one level of lethal damage per day, and one level of aggravated damage per week, leaving only faint scars etched in the metal.

An Essence 3 repurchase increases the armor’s health track to (Essence) −0 levels.
### Dissonant
The armor only has one −0 level, or (Essence − 1) with the Essence 3 repurchase.
### Resonant
The soak penalty from damage is halved, rounded up.
