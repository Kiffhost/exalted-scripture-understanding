The necromancer may retreat to seclusion, taking counsel with the Skull Diary for a full day without sleep, food, drink, or other comforts. She emerges with (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Wits]]) necromantic motes, which she spend on any spell so long as she has one of her skulls at hand. Later uses of this ritual refresh this pool, but do not stack.
