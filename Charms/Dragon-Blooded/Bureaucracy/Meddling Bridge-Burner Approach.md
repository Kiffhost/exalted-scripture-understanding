The Dragon-Blood’s incendiary rhetoric turns her political rival’s bases against them or drives a wedge between even the closest of business partners. After spending at least a scene interacting with a character in his official bureaucratic capacity, she rolls ([Manipulation or Intelligence] + Bureaucracy) opposing his ([Charisma or Intelligence] + Bureaucracy).
If she succeeds, she may assail her target’s position within a bureaucratic organization. Any rolls that character makes to carry out the official business of that organization or to influence his subordinates within the bureaucracy to perform their official duties lose successes equal to the 1s on the roll. Additionally, for the purpose of the victim’s influence rolls, any positive Ties toward him or toward the organization possessed by organization members are treated as one step lower.
Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood may attack one of her victim’s business or political relationships with another character. To do so, that other character must be present when the Dragon-Blood uses this Charm. If she uses this variant, any influence roll her victim makes against his partner in the context of their business or political relationship lose successes equal to the 1s on the roll, as do any read intentions rolls he makes against the partner. Additionally, the victim suffers –1 Resolve and Guile against his partner.
Any positive Ties the partner has toward the victim or any organization the victim belongs to are treated as one step lower for the purpose of the victim’s influence rolls.
The victim may free himself from the effects of the first version of this Charm by completing a project to advance or reestablish his position with an organization, or the second version by completing a project to fulfill the requests or agenda of the partner who was targeted by this Charm. Either version can be negated by magic such as Woe-Capturing Web (Exalted, p. 288).
Once anyone uses this Charm against a member of an organization, members of that organization can’t be targeted with it until the start of the next story.
