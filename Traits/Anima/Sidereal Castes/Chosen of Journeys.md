Light-footed Mercury, Maiden of Journeys, sees every path that could be taken and knows what lies at their ends. It is her Chosen’s duty to ensure that all things go where Heaven wills them. Her Harbingers are the invisible hand on the ship’s till, the rider whose message comes just in time, the guide who knows the secret ways through the wilderness. When uncertainty, fear, or distraction keep travelers from their destined paths, Mercury’s Chosen guide them back on course; when obstacles stand in his way, they intercede to remove them.

In the First Age, Heaven’s Messengers charted Creation’s most perilous wildernesses, the writhing chaos of the deep Wyld, the Demon City’s alien geometries, the Underworld’s dark waterways, and more. As navigators and advisors, they guided diplomatic missions and armies on the march, blessing them with Mercury’s favor and coordinating their movements with destiny. At sea, they bedeviled the likes of Lintha, the Niobraran League, and the Orphan Maelstrom born of the Dreaming Sea. The First Age’s wondrous conveyances came under their oversight: skyships, gates of auspicious passage, dragon line rails that once spanned Creation’s geomancy, distant starspires, and more.

Much has been lost in the Second Age. Gone are the great roadways that spanned Directions, the gleaming fleets that filled the skies. Today’s Harbingers make do with what remains, weaving the fates of caravans, seafaring ships, and travelers by foot. Many seek to rebuild, guiding explorers seeking long-lost trade routes, blessing projects to build roads and bridges, or restoring artifact conveyances fallen into ruin. As explorers and wayfarers, they travel to far-flung corners of the world in search of ancient artifacts, rare materials, and other assets to benefit the bureau or their own personal agendas.

Destined Harbingers’ mortal lives are defined by journeys. Some made their living as itinerant laborers, sailors, caravan guards, couriers, traveling merchants, diplomats, or scavenger princes. Others took to the road in search of greater opportunities, freedom from persecution, or a chance to escape the past. Some were born into nomadic or semi-nomadic cultures, while others grew up amidst mass migrations. Not all have profound reasons for their journeys: escaping gambling debts, a drunken mishap, and simple wanderlust all please Mercury.

# Auspicious Prospects
## Auspicious Prospects for Journeys

The Harbinger may pay one mote to learn whether a journey would align with destiny and any relevant details about the journey’s circumstances, like what time the travelers should set out. 

## Lesser Sign of Mercury

The Harbinger may pay five motes to reflexively make Mercury’s lesser sign, tracing it in yellow stardust. Until her next turn, she and all allies within close range add (her Essence, maximum 5) non-Charm dice on movement actions. This is free at bonfire. 

## Greater Sign of Mercury

Once per story, the Harbinger may pay twenty motes and one Willpower to make Mercury’s greater sign, shining golden in the sky. She transports herself, her Circlemates, and up to (Essence x2) others to anywhere she’s familiar with in Creation or Heaven. Rolls she makes to overcome wards against such travel gain −2 target number. In combat, this takes her entire turn and she must wait until the start of her next turn for this effect to take place. If she moves or is moved before her next turn, this power fails, refunding its cost and resetting it. Characters she brings with her must remain within long range until this is completed.
