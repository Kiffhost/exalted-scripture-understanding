Swords and arrows turn aside at the last moment as the sash cinches tight around the wearer’s waist, heavy with knotted misfortune. Against a decisive attack, she may pay two motes per health level to transform damage into bad luck, up to (higher of Essence of 3) health levels. This misfortune takes a form of the Storyteller’s choice at some point after the scene but before the end of the story, based on the number of health levels transformed: BEGIN TABLE Health Levels Transformed Effect 1 or 2 Small twists of fate that inflict a −2 penalty, such as unusual traffic, awful weather, misplaced papers, etc. 3 or 4 Temporary, personal setbacks, such as the theft of an important document, the arrival of an unexpected investigator, or mistaken identity. 5 or more Significant trouble, often for the character’s Merits, such as seized assets, incapacitated contacts, or misunderstandings that sour a relationship. END TABLE Reset: Once per scene unless reset by falling to a −2 wound penalty or lower.
