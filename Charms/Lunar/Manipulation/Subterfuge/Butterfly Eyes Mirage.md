*The Lunar’s innate genius for misdirection and beguiling presence can blind a man to a tiger staring him in the face.*
She makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + {Larceny, [[Performance]], or Presence}) instill roll against a single target. If she succeeds, she prevents him from noticing one thing present in the scene — a character, object, natural feature, etc. Inanimate things that span more than a single range band can’t be concealed. The Lunar must continue speaking to maintain this concealment, doing so as a reflexive action on each of her turns. 
If the Lunar prevents her victim from noticing another character, this functions as though that character had successfully made a [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] roll to establish concealment against her victim, including the potential to make surprise attacks. If that character breaks concealment by attacking or taking other overt actions, this Charm ends. 
If the Lunar conceals an object, terrain feature, or other inanimate thing, the target can’t notice it with any sense except touch. He could be rendered unaware of the sword sheathed at his side, the flames raging in a burning building, or the sudden drop of a cliff as he chases the winged Lunar toward it. While he may walk heedlessly into perils, he becomes aware of them with enough time to at least attempt to mitigate harm — if he fell off a cliff, he could attempt an [[Athletics]] roll to grab onto the cliffside before falling. 
If the Lunar’s misdirection imperils one of her victim’s Defining Intimacies—for example, if a concealed assassin moves to cut down his beloved husband—the victim may spend one [[Willpower]] to resist this influence. Otherwise, this influence can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]]. 
This Charm can only be used on a character once per story. 
## Protean 

In shapes that her target has a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of curiosity, fascination, love, desire, etc. toward, the Lunar adds ([[Essence]]) successes on her roll.
