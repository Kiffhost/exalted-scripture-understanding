The core of the [[Social Influence]] system is the [[Influence]] roll. The dice pool for an influence roll is always #attribute/social + #Ability (usually #Ability/influence) against a difficulty of the [[Resolve]] rating of the character you’re trying to influence. 

Successful influence rolls allow you to alter a character’s feelings or beliefs or to convince him to do something for you, based on the [[#Social Actions|social action]] or Charm used. Occasionally, you will use other Attributes and Abilities to take actions that are not influence rolls, such as rolling ([[Perception]] + [[Socialize]]) to read a person’s personality, beliefs, or agenda. All of these social actions are described in more detail below.
# Resisting
The base difficulty for an [[#Influence roll]] is always the [[Resolve]] rating of the character targeted by the roll, with the chosen action succeeding or failing with the roll. However, in some cases there are further considerations before the action is fully resolved. See also the
## Spending [[Willpower]]
Even if a character’s [[Resolve]] is overcome, he may still have an opportunity to deny the influence. If the influence is trying to change how he feels, such as by creating, destroying, or changing his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he may spend a point of [[Willpower]] to: 
- Stop a new [[Intimacy]] from being created. Although the character is moved, he just can’t afford to invest himself in a new person or cause! 
- Stop a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] from being weakened. Even though the influence was convincing, the character just has too much invested in the [[Intimacy]] to give up now, even if he wants to! 
- Reject a successful inspire action—the character uses his force of will to deny his swelling passions.
## [[Decision Points]]
Refusing successful [[Social Influence|influence]] to make the character *do something* (usually [[Persuade]], [[Bargain]] or [[Threaten]]) is trickier. When a character fails to resist such influence with his [[Resolve]], he enters into a special state called a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]].
## [[Unacceptable Influence]]
There are limits on what can be achieved with social influence. No amount of charisma is sufficient to talk someone into suicide, or to convince a die-hard patriot to betray his cause. If a request is so antithetical to the nature and personality of its target that it cannot possibly succeed, it is said to be [[unacceptable influence]].
