*When the physician’s slave Copper Turtle Exalted, Luna wore the form of one of the plague-stricken wretches his master had left for dead.*
With a gurgling death rattle, Luna told him how he might cure both the pestilence ravaging the land and his own imprisonment. That night, he tossed his master into the corpse pit; a week later, he returned in jackal shape to gnaw his master’s spine free of rotting flesh. From moonsilver and bone he fashioned a purifying weapon to slay all manner of afflictions. His arrows drove the plague from the land, and slew slavers, ministers, and princes. When the Great Contagion struck, Copper Turtle — by then an esteemed shahan-ya — bequeathed [[Nightbane]] to his most gifted student, sending her south while he traveled eastward to fight the pestilence. Neither survived. The [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]], hard hit by the Contagion, was too late to retrieve [[Nightbane]]; instead, an opportunistic scavenger prince looted it and countless other valuables from the corpse-strewn desolation. Despite the Pact’s efforts to reclaim it, it’s currently kept well-guarded in the [[Guild]]’s Nexus headquarters, used by an Exigent champion to cure high-ranking Guildsmen of their infirmities.
