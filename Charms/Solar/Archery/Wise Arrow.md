With skill and effort, the Exalt guides her arrow to its mark. The Exalt may use this Charm to supplement a withering or decisive attack, reducing the benefits of cover. The defense bonus of heavy and light cover is reduced by one, while characters under no cover suffer a -1 penalty to their normal [[Defense]]. In addition, after taking an aim action, the Solar may activate this Charm to strike an opponent in full cover. The Exalt shoots along an arc or angle that perfectly matches her opponentâ€™s position. So long as there is some opening where an arrow can get through, [[Wise Arrow]] treats a character in full cover as if he merely has +3 [[Defense]].
