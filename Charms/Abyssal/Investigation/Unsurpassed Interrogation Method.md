*If love of justice will not sway the guilty, then fear of Death’s Lawgiver must suffice.*
The Abyssal makes a special (Wits + Investigation) threaten roll to interrogate a character. If successful, her target must answer one question truthfully and to fully, plus an additional question for each of her extra successes. He can refuse to answer or give a false response by paying one Willpower per question.
If the Abyssal’s victim escapes her presence, he doesn’t have to answer any further questions. In combat, enemies can refuse to answer without spending Willpower, but may still answer at the Storyteller’s discretion, especially if they have a relevant Intimacy.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used against a character once per session.
