The flames of Solar passion run deep. Sometimes they burst forth, igniting the greatness in others. With this Charm, the Solar prepares an acolyte, follower, student or agent for some great task. This is a simple dramatic action in which she exults and extolls the virtue of her cause, invoking a [[Intimacy|Principle]] which she has instilled upon her target. This is not a social influence action, merely the way in which she pours excellence into her subject. For as long as she commits [[Essence]], her charge gains three automatic non-Charm successes to apply to action taken on behalf of a [[Intimacy|Principle]] granted by the Solar. The character may use these successes all on one roll, or may spread them out. Once all the successes have been spent, the Solar senses it, as commitment to the Charm ends. Successes granted by this Charm have certain limitations: •	 The character may not invoke more successes on an action than he has dots in the relevant Ability. For example, the Solar’s envoy, having [[Performance]] 2 and [[Thrown]] 1, could apply two successes to his address to the corrupt senate of Paramour, before using his last automatic success to fling a hidden stiletto into the legate’s neck. He would not be able to put more than one success into the assassination attempt, and each action would have to be done in upholding or advancing a [[Intimacy|Principle]] given to him by the Solar. (In this case, perhaps the legate was holding the senate hostage, preventing them from accepting the envoy’s influence.) •	 This Charm is stackable, but the Solar may not stack it on a single target more than ([[Essence]]) times. •	Even if the character is benefitting from multiple applications of this Charm, he may not enhance a single action by more than three granted successes. The Solar may enhance as many characters with this Charm as she has motes to pay the cost.
