The deadliest Solars use this legendary stealth technique to evade discovery. When in a place of concealment, the Exalt may use this Charm to anchor the thread of her Essence to the spot. Should she relinquish her commitment to the Charm, so long as she is within three range bands of her hiding place, she is carried there instantly on wings of anima. She does not travel the space between. This counts as an automatically successful Stealth attempt. After the Solar flashes back to her anchor point, others may not attempt to detect her for two rounds. Survival
