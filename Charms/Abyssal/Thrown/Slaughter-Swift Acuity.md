*Eager for bloodshed, the Abyssal cuts down her prey before they can even draw their blades.*
When the Abyssal rolls [[Join Battle]], she rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10. If she wins [[Join Battle]], she may reflexively make a withering or decisive attack against each of up to ([[Dexterity]]) enemies.
[[Slaughter-Swift Acuity]] is incompatible with [[Charms]] from other combat Abilities that enhance [[Join Battle]] rolls.
With a [[Thrown]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, when the Abyssal makes a decisive attack with this Charm, each 9 or 10 on the damage roll adds +1 to her base [[Initiative]] upon resetting.
