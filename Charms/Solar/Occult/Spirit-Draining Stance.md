The Lawgiver has the power to draw cold entropy and ethereal power from ghosts and spirits, adding swiftness and surety to her attacks. While this Charm is active, the Solarâ€™s successful withering attacks against spirit opponents generate one automatic level of withering damage. At Occult 4+, Essence 2+, the Exalt can choose to drain a mote instead of a point of Initiative.
