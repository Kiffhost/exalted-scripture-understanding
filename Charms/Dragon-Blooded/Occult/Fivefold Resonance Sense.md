Closing her eyes and stilling her mind, the Dragon-Blood reaches out to the Essence of the world. She may spend up to a scene in meditation, during which she can sense the presence of the five elements — weather patterns, rock formations and geology, fires, bodies of water, living plants, and similar elemental manifestations — out to (the higher of Essence or 3) range bands. Their presence is revealed to her without a roll. In addition, she adds a single non-Charm bonus die on any Awareness, Investigation, Occult, or Survival rolls to detect or track jade, elementals, elemental demesnes and manses, or other form of elemental magic for the duration. An Occult 5, Essence 3 repurchase waives the meditation requirement, allowing the Dragon-Blood to benefit from this Charm while acting normally.
