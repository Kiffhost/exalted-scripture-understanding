*Sensing an unexpected angle of attack, the Sidereal strikes along the path that leads past her enemy’s guard.*
When the Sidereal makes an attack that benefits from aiming, she rolls (Perception + Melee) opposing her enemy’s (Perception + Awareness or combat Ability) roll before the attack roll. If she succeeds, her attack becomes unblockable and undodgeable. If she reduced the roll’s target number, the same reduction applies on the attack roll.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating an enemy with an attack that benefited from aiming.
