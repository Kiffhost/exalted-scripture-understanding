*Promising that things can always be worse, the Sidereal causes a weapon embedded in her foe to dissolve into a golden whirlwind, drawing in stray arrows, stones and debris, and the occasional small animal.*
The Sidereal makes an undodgeable (Wits + Thrown) withering or decisive attack against an enemy afflicted by Life-Gets-Worse Approach. If this crashes him or deals 3+ decisive damage, the embedded weapon dissolves into his Essence, becoming impossible to remove for the scene.
Additionally, all other enemies within short range of the primary target whose Defense is beaten by the attack are caught in the crossfire. They suffer (Essence) dice of withering or decisive damage, depending on which kind of attack the Sidereal made. This ignores soak and Hardness. Withering damage to these secondary targets doesn’t award Initiative. They can’t suffer more damage than the primary target.
If the Sidereal has any familiars within short range of the primary target, she may have them be drawn into close range with him by the vortex. One of her familiars may reflexively make an attack against him: withering if the Sidereal’s attack was decisive, or vice versa. This counts as its attack for the round, or the next round if it’s already attacked.
## Reset
This Charm can’t be used against the same enemy more than once per scene.
