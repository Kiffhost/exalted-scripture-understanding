*Blood and fear grease the wheels of bureaucracy, leading inexorably toward the truth.*
The Abyssal begins an investigation into an organization by making a demonstration out of one of its members, publicly punishing him for some offense, real or fabricated. She doesn’t need any authority within an organization to investigate it, so long as the group’s leadership approves her punishment — either in advance, or by giving it their imprimatur after the fact.
The Abyssal adds five automatic successes on [[Investigation]] and [[Socialize]] rolls made in the course of the investigation. When she deals with organization members in the course of the investigation, their fear encourages honesty. This counts as a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of obedient fear toward her. If their [[Resolve]] (including modifiers from [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]) is lower than the Abyssal’s ([[Charisma]] or [[Manipulation]]), this counts as a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] instead.
This terror is all the greater if the Abyssal initiates her investigation with a fatal punishment. The [[Intimacy|Tie]] is imposed in all interactions, not just those related to the investigation, and organization members suffer −2 [[Resolve]] when determining its intensity.
