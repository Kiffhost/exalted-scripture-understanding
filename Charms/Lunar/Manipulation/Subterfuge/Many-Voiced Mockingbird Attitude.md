The Lunar speaks with countless stolen tongues. She flawlessly mimics, for a single influence roll or ten seconds of regular speech, the voice of a character whose speech she’s spent at least an hour observing or whose shape she’s claimed—eveninshapesnotcapableofhumanspeech.

She can still use her own voice, or usethisCharm’ssupplementaleffecttomimicothervoices. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar uses this Charm in the shape of the character she imitates, she instead rerolls 1s on influence rolls to impersonate him or explain away discrepancies. Alternatively, she may reflexively add +1 Guile against a roll that would reveal information contradictory to her impersonation. She gains both benefits while using this Charm’s scene-long version. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape can mimic human speech or other animals’ noises may learn this as a Charisma Charm, with Argent Songbird Voice (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
