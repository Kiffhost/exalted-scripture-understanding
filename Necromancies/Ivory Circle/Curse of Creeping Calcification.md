*The necromancer exhales a wisp of undulating white dust that darts forth to infect her victim, slowly transforming his flesh to ivory.*
The necromancer rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) as an unblockable decisive attack against a target within short range. Success infects him with the ivory flesh affliction (Virulence 2, Morbidity {higher of necromancer’s [[Essence]] or 3}, Interval: One day). Her original target automatically fails his roll to avoid contracting the disease.
Minor Symptom: The target suffers a −1 mobility penalty as his flesh partially transforms into ivory.
Major Symptom: The mobility penalty increases to −3.
Defining Symptom: The mobility penalty subtracts successes rather than dice, and he treats all movement as if through difficult terrain.
Death: [[Mortal]] characters die, transformed entirely into ivory, while others are rendered fully catatonic, able to move nothing but their eyes. This can affect even the Exalted, though extensive medical treatment may still save them. Spirits can be freed by destroying their calcified form, letting them reform as usual.
This spell can be used on dematerialized characters, forcibly materializing them upon infection and preventing them from dematerializing while they’re afflicted. If their [[Essence]] is greater than the necromancer’s, they may pay one [[Willpower]] to ignore this for one scene.
## Control
The sorcerer grows patches of scaly bone across her body, granting her the [[Unusual Hide]] Merit (Exalted, p. 166) at two dots.
## Distortion (10)
The target reduces the mobility penalty by one, and can’t die as a result of the disease. A spellcaster who’s distorted the spell may use [[Occult]] instead of [[Medicine]] to treat the disease.
