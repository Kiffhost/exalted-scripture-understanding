*Ten thousand gentle crests can leave even the grandest groves of trees stunted and malformed, poisoned from the roots with the sea’s saltwater grief.*
When the wielder uses [[Still Waters Hide Fury]] against a despised character with whom she’s interacted socially in a previous scene, she may pay five motes and one [[Willpower]] to treat each such scene as a turn studying him from concealment, up to a maximum of ([[Essence]]) scenes. She makes a single ([[Manipulation]] + [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]]) roll against his ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) for these past interactions, gaining (Essence/2, rounded up) [[Initiative]] for each scene on a successful roll. Failure doesn’t reveal her presence. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) by killing a despised character.
