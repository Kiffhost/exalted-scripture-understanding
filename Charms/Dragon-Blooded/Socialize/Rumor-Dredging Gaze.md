A master blackmailer, the Dragon-Blood draws forth secrets from the murkiest depths. She rolls to read intentions with double 9s. Instead of specifying an [[Intimacy]] she wishes to discern, the Dragon-Blood instead uncovers whichever [[Intimacy]] her target most desires to keep hidden from her. If she uses this information to blackmail her target with a bargain or threaten action in the same scene, she doubles 9s on the influence roll, which can be made with any social Ability. A successful influence roll grants her one [[Willpower]].
