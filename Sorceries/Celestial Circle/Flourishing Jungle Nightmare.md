*The sorcerer bites into a fruit and spits out the seeds, speaking the ancient words that commanded Creation’s first plants to thrive.* 

A mass of trees, vines, brambles, and other plant and fungal life sprouts within long range of the sorcerer, breaking through flagstones and cellars alike if necessary. The sorcerer may exclude some portions of this area from the spell’s effect. The plants are appropriate to the region, but always exhibit some form of strangeness: flowers have vivid, unnatural colors; trees bear fruits unknown to any in Creation; mushrooms seem to laugh mockingly as they disperse their spores. 

The overgrowth is difficult terrain for everyone but the sorcerer — even her allies. It can provide heavy cover (Exalted, p. 199) and suffices for characters to enter concealment with Stealth rolls. The overgrowth can’t be cleared by anything short of Solar Circle Sorcery or equivalent destructive forces— if hacked at or burnt away, it regrows almost instantly. 

On each of the sorcerer’s turns, she may take one of the following actions. They can only affect characters within the overgrowth, and the sorcerer must be within the overgrowth to use them. They count as her attack for the round. However, the sorcerer can’t take the same action twice in a row — she must alternate between them. 
## Entangling Vines Durance
The sorcerer makes a grapple gambit to entangle an enemy in vines, roots, or twisting branches. She rolls (Intelligence + Occult) for both the attack and control rolls. She can take grapple actions via the entangling plants and can flurry them with this spell’s special actions at no penalty. She isn’t penalized by the grapple or limited in what actions she can take, and doesn’t lose rounds of control when attacked. However, the grappled enemy or one of his allies can spend his entire turn hacking or burning away the overgrowth to reduce the total rounds of grapple control by two. The sorcerer can have multiple enemies grappled this way at a time, but can only take one grapple action each round. 

The overgrowth remains after the spell’s duration ends, but ceases to regrow if damaged, allowing it to eventually be cleared away. For a year and a day thereafter, any plant or fungi that grows in the affected land will be touched by this spell’s strangeness. 
## Maw of the Hungry Jungle
A one-time environmental hazard engulfs an enemy and everyone within short range of him — thorns erupt from vines and stems, spiked burrs twist through flesh, strange carnivorous plants bite at foes. The hazard has difficulty (Intelligence) and Damage (Essence)L. The sorcerer can spend Initiative to increase its damage, paying two Initiative per +1 Damage. 
## Poisonous Bloom
A cloud of poisonous spores or pollen fills the air out to short range from any point within the overgrowth. This inhaled poison has Damage 4i/ round, Duration (Essence + Intelligence) rounds, and a –3 penalty. No matter how many successes victims roll, they can’t reduce the poison’s duration below one round. 
## Terror Hidden in the Leaves
The sorcerer grants (Essence) Initiative to an ally in concealment, and may also transfer up to half her own Initiative, rounded down. 
# Control
The sorcerer can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to increase this spell’s duration to up to one day. If her blood or saliva is shed on a plant, it undergoes a brief burst of unnatural growth: a flower bud might bloom immediately, or a seed might begin visibly germinating just after being planted. She can use a drop of her blood or spittle in place of a seed to cast this spell. 
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
Distortion reduces the spell’s range by one range band, causing any overgrowth outside its diminished area to wither and rot. The spell can be distorted multiple times, potentially reducing its range down to close
