*Bending her knees low to sink into a stance that minimizes her profile, the vizier recedes from the front lines to guide her shadow fingers in battle.*
The stylist gains the following benefits: 
- When she’s attacked, the stylist may treat a shadow finger within close range as protecting her with a defend other action. 
- She can make a distract gambit to benefit all her shadow fingers. She divides Initiative equal to twice the gambit’s cost among all shadow fingers, rounding up. 
- She reduces the −3 penalty for Stealth in combat by the number of shadow fingers within short range. 
- She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on rolls to introduce facts and may do so reflexively. 
## Special activation rules
When one of the stylist’s shadow fingers wins Join Battle, she may reflexively enter this Form.
