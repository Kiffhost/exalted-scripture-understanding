Abilities represent broad knowledge of a given field, but few people go through life without acquiring unique talents and special interests. In Exalted, these areas of expertise are referred to as Specialties, and come into play when your character has a chance to benefit from his special talent. Each [[Specialty]] is attached to a specific Ability. When you make a roll with an Ability with an associated [[Specialty]], you can add one die to that roll—if you can justify why your character’s training gives him an edge.

Specialties can be as broad or narrow as you like, but there must be notable situations where they can’t apply. [[Melee]] (Swords) is perfectly acceptable, but [[Melee]] (While Armed) or (While Breathing) are not. Sure, your character can try and keep fighting while asphyxiating, or literally have his breath stolen by a Sidereal attacker, but those are edge cases. The Storyteller has the final say in whether or not a [[Specialty]] is acceptable. 

Only one [[Specialty]] can apply to a single roll, even if your character has more than one that could be useful— if your character is trying to carve an insult into his foe’s flesh and has both [[Melee]] (Swords) and [[Melee]] (Humiliate Opponents), he could apply one or the other, but not both. 

You can buy as many Specialties for your character as you want, but you can’t purchase Specialties for Abilites rated at zero dots.
