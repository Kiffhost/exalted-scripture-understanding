The Dragon-Blood observes the natural rhythms of her patientâ€™s body, intuiting any ailments that afflict him. She may complete a roll to diagnose a patient (Exalted, p. 237) in a handful of seconds. Successfully diagnosing a disease, poison, or similar ailment grants her a temporary [[Medicine]] specialty in it. She retains the specialty indefinitely, but may only have one specialty granted by this Charm at a time.
