This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
The character owns a magical item—see Chapter Nine for more details.
A two-dot Artifact is a minor wonder with limited but still supernatural usefulness, such as a goblet that nullifies any poison within it, or a jeweled torc that keeps the wearer fresh and clean in any circumstances. Many such items were created in the First Age, and have become rare and highly-valued commodities in the Age of Sorrows, lusted after the wealthy and the mighty when they appear.
Three-dot Artifacts are what most individuals think of when the word “artifact” is spoken—they are broadly powerful wonders, such as most daiklaves, magical armor, hypnotic cloaks, and the like.
Four-dot Artifacts are legends unto themselves, with powers of significant complexity or depth. The most famous Artfacts of this rating are “hundred-year daiklaves:” weapons manufactured over a century of passion and toil, and possessing truly formidable Evocations. Other such Artifacts might include cloaks that allow their wearer to ride the wind, or veils that scatter light and deflect the eye.
Five-dot Artifacts are legendary treasures in the Age of Sorrows—magical vessels, lesser First Age siege weapons, and legendary “thousand-year daiklaves.” Any character coming into possession of such an item will be defined as much by ownership of it as by any other element of his personality or legend, and as such, five-dot Artifacts may only be purchased with explicit Storyteller approval.
Artifacts of yet greater power may still be found in Creation on the rarest of occasions: mighty remnants of the long-fallen First Age such as invincible warstriders, “ten thousand-year daiklaves,” or magical warships. These are considered to be rated Artifact N/A, and cannot be taken during character creation by spending points—as these items are of chronicle-defining power, they may only make their way into a player’s possession if the player and Storyteller both want to spin a game around that story, or if a player somehow forges or unearths such a world-shaking miracle during play.

#### Sidereal
This Merit can represent artifacts on indefinite loan from the Bureau. A Sidereal can retain such an artifact for as long as she has use for it except in extremis, but she may take on ritual or bureaucratic obligations associated with it. Examples include purifying a cursed manse with the artifact every Calibration, undergo impromptu tests of character from the god who forged it, or having to occasionally secure an ornery god’s signature on authorization forms. The obligation is a Flaw, granting experience when it significantly inconveniences her (Exalted, p. 167).
