At any point during a song played with the prerequisite, the Lawgiver may channel and focus the song on a particular character, intensifying the mood of the music into that character’s social influence. Roll the Solar’s ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance) with (Essence) automatic successes against the Resolve of the beneficiary’s target. If the Solar is enhancing a Presence or Socialize action, this is typically the Resolve of a single character, but it can be the group’s Resolve if the Solar is enhancing another character’s performance with her own music. If successful, convert the Solar’s extra successes into nonCharm bonus dice on the beneficiary’s social influence. If the beneficiary is successful on a roll so enhanced, the Lawgiver regains a point of Willpower, though this does not confer any knowledge of that success to the Exalt.
