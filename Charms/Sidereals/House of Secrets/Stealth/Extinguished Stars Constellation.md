The Sidereal conceals the threads of her companions’ fates within the constellation she stands under, subsuming them into her resplendent destiny. The Sidereal extends her resplendent destiny to her Circlemates and up to ([[Essence]] + 1) other willing characters, giving them a semblance suitable for companions of resplendent destiny’s role and the usual benefits of a resplendent destiny (p. XX). If multiple characters under a destiny make disguise rolls that benefit from it simultaneously, they can all use the highest roll among them. In places concealed by [[Privacy-Enhancing Gesture]], that Charm’s target number increase applies to rolls against such disguises. Rolls not enhanced by superhuman senses or magic automatically fail.
