Once per scene, when the sorcerer succeeds on a threaten roll or a roll to inspire fear against a nontrivial character, she gains sorcerous motes equal to the Attribute used, which last until the scene ends. If she successfully influences a higher-Essence character, she gains additional sorcerous motes equal to the difference in their Essence ratings.
