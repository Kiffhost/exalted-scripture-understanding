The Dragon-Blood strikes the earth or an earthen structure with precise deliberation, attuning herself to the flow of Earth [[Essence]]. She may cause a held object to vanish into soil, stone, or similar materials, submerging into them without displacing or increasing the earth. She cannot store an object in something that is smaller than it — she could hide her daiklave in a brick wall, but not in a pebble, coin, or gemstone. A second use of this Charm allows her to retrieve the embedded object. This Charm can also be used to steal objects that other Dragon-Blooded have hidden using it. Finding the location of a hidden cache usually requires both [[Investigation]] and [[Awareness]] rolls. The hidden object also reappears, intact, if whatever it’s embedded in is destroyed.
