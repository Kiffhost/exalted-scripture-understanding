Mere metal cannot endure Sekhem’s flames. This Evocation is a difficulty 5 gambit that superheats an opponent’s weapon. If successful, an artifact becomes too hot to hold for the rest of the scene; a nonartifact weapon is destroyed. The opponent must roll (Wits + combat Ability), difficulty 3 (5 for Worn weapons), to drop the weapon before getting burned. Failure results in one level of lethal damage and a −1 penalty to all actions involving the hand(s) that wielded the weapon until that wound heals. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation has no effect against artifact weapons. 

## Resonant

At Heat 7+, this Evocation’s Willpower cost is waived.
