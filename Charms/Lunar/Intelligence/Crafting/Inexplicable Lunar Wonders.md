Standing on mystery’s precipice, the Lunar anticipates challenges yet to arise. She begins a superior or legendary project with any Attribute to create an artifact or manse without defining exactly what she’s making, depicting a craftsman of uncanny foresight. For an artifact, she need only determine its level and what magical materials and other components she’s incorporating into it; for manses, only the demesne she’s raising it atop (which determines its aspect and level) need be determined. The project should be left offscreen or vague; while characters can observe the artifact or manse in progress,playerswon’tknowwhatitisuntilit’sfinished. Upon completing the project, the player reveals what her character has been crafting all along. This Charm can’t create First Age artifice. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by completing a superior or legendary project other than the one it enhances.
