*With but a thought, the Wheel’s master transforms it, striking a foe with its heft before drawing back with the speed of lumenir.*
The Wheel’s master changes it form reflexively. If she uses this to attack an enemy after moving toward him, she retains the benefits of mounted combat and waives the [[Initiative]] cost of making a smash attack. If she uses it to disengage after attacking, she doesn’t lose [[Initiative]]. Chariots Riding a chariot in combat uses the mounted combat rules for the steed that draws the chariot (Exalted, p. 202). Most chariots designed for war can carry one to two passengers, who also gain the benefits of mounted combat. Chariots provide light cover to its driver and passengers, without requiring take cover rolls. However, mounts drawing a chariot suffer a −1 mobility penalty. Exceptional chariots, including artifact chariots, have no mobility penalty, which replaces the usual equipment bonus.
