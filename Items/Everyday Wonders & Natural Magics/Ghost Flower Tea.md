This rare and unusual drug consists of the ground dried petals of the luminous, palm-sized ghost flower, which grows only in shadowlands in the temperate portions of the East. Users steep ghost flowers with water, creating a faintly luminous tea that they drink just before sleep.
The first few times it’s used, ghost flower tea produces vivid dreams in which the user can see and communicate with any ghosts nearby. Continued use (more doses than the user’s [Stamina + Resistance] in a single season) means that the user builds up enough resistance to the drug that she can remain awake under its influence and see and communicate with ghosts while awake. Taking more than ([Stamina + Resistance] x 3) doses in a single season allows the user to touch and be touched by ghosts. She can fight duels with ghostly opponents, or even take ghostly lovers. 
Frequent users appear pale and sickly, and their lips glow faintly in dim light. Ghosts can also take ghost flower tea and use it to communicate with the living in a similar way. Anyone who dies while taking ghost flower tea becomes a ghost herself
