A living divinity, the Lunar craves the worship and adulation she’s owed by right. Everyone she sees must adore, love, or obsess over her. Those who don’t, or who fail to sufficiently fawn over her, must be won over by whatever means she chooses to employ — artistic performances, lavish gifts, seduction, demagoguery, healing ailments, destroying hated edifices, working spectacular miracles, etc.
This ends if the Lunar’s attempts to win over a significantly dangerous adversary give him an advantage over her or her allies.
