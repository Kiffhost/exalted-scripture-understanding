Such is the Lunar’s effortless allure that she radiates desirability through the most innocuous acts. She adds an automatic success on an influence roll to seduce someone or instill a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of love, lust, etc., toward herself (or her current shape), and conceals her efforts from her target and onlookers. They won’t recognize that she attempted to influence her target unless they successfully read her intentions or profile her that scene.
