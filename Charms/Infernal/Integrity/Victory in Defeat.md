*The Infernal can endure any humiliation in the name of ambition, biding her time until the moment for betrayal draws near.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after her Resolve is beaten by an influence roll that she could have spent Willpower to resist. By forgoing the opportunity to resist, she forms a Minor Tie of resentment toward the influencing character and steals one Willpower from him. She can’t voluntarily weaken the Tie for as long as she remains subject to his influence: until she’s fully removed an instilled Intimacy, completed a task she’s been persuaded to perform, etc.
