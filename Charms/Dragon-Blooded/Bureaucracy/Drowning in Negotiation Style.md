*Calling upon the endless [[Essence]] of the depths to stand witness to a contract, the Dragon-Blood binds all parties to it to their words.*
This Charm may be invoked when the Dragon-Blood witnesses a verbal or written contract being made. If any party to the contract willingly violates it, he drowns on dry land as water appears inside his mouth and lungs. This deals ([[Essence]] x2) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]], and leaves ink-black stains dripping from his mouth that are visible only to the Dragon-Blood and other parties to the sanctified contract, marking him as an oathbreaker for (Dragon-Bloodâ€™s [[Essence]] + [[Charisma]]) years.
