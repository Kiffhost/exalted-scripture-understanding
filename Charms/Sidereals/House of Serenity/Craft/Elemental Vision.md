The Sidereal’s eyes shimmer with the Essence of her patron Maiden’s element as she deals with spirits. Each of the Maidens is associated with an element: Mercury with air, Venus with wood, Mars with fire, Jupiter with water, and Saturn with earth. The Sidereal gains the following benefits with respect to her Maiden’s element: 
- She adds (Craft) dice on Occult rolls involving elements and other spirits associated with her Maiden’s element as well as demesnes, manses, hearthstones, and similar elemental magic. This bonus doesn’t apply on Shape Sorcery rolls. 
- Her understanding of the element smooths her dealings with its elementals, Dragon-Blooded of the appropriate Aspect, and other supernatural beings associated with it. Such characters count as having a Minor Tie of patience to her unless they have a negative Tie to her. 
- She can use Craft instead of the usual Ability for any Perception-based roll against a spirit. Against elementals and other spirits associated with her Maiden’s element, she waives Excellencies’ mote costs to reduce such roll’s target numbers. 
- She can use Craft instead of Lore to introduce facts about her Maiden’s element and spirits or other phenomena associated with it. She doesn’t need a Lore background to do so.
