Her blades rippling with invisible flame, the Immaculate agitates her foeâ€™s Essence with a precision strike, burning him from within. She makes a withering attack against an enemy with a lower Initiative. The Initiative she gains from the damage roll is halved, but the enemy loses one mote for every 9 on the damage roll, and two for every 10. The Immaculate chooses whether personal or peripheral motes are lost first. If this crashes that enemy, his lost motes ignite as an inward flame, rolling one die of lethal damageforeverytwomoteslost(roundedup),maximum (Essence), ignoring Hardness. The Immaculate may expend her Fire Aura to gain the full amount of Initiative from the damage roll.
