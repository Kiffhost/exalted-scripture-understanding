*Loose stones, leaves, and other debris dance in orbit around Everlasting Descent’s wielder.*
The wielder reflexively rolls to take cover by gathering debris, clutter, and other unattended objects within short range. This increases to medium at Spin 1+ and long at Spin 3+. Success provides light cover for this Evocation’s duration and grants one Spin. If there’s a significant amount of debris available within this Evocation’s range, it provides heavy cover instead. If the wielder renews this Evocation when its duration ends, its Initiative cost is waived and she doesn’t need to roll again. 
## Dissonant
This Evocation is Supplemental; the wielder must use an action to take cover normally.
