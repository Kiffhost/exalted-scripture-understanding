*The Solar sweeps [[Volcano Cutter]] across the boiling earth, gathering up its searing [[Essence]] into the blade, then unleashing it in a catastrophic blast of flames when she next strikes down an enemy.*
This Evocation may be used as soon as the Solar steps into an eruption point, drawing the eruption point into [[Volcano Cutter]] before it can detonate under her feet and thereby removing it from the battlefield. Her next successful decisive attack adds two dice of damage per 5 points of [[Initiative]] held in the eruption point. [[Volcano Cutter]] can only hold one eruption point at a time.
