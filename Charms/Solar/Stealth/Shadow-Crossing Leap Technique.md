Unfurling her unseen anima, the Solar leaps to join the darkness she has conquered. While concealed, Exalt may move up to one range band, from one place of cover to an equal place of cover, without penalty. Theremust be a path for the Solar to make this leap: she cannot leap through solid walls or closed doors. This transition is instantaneous, the Solar blinking out of one location and flashing into another without passing through the space between. This Charm is incompatible with [[Blurred Form Style]]. At [[Essence]] 4+, the Solar can flash into hiding places that do not have a clear path to move by passing through structures that are transparent or partially opaque, such as windows or gates. At [[Essence]] 5+, the Solar may use this Charm even when she is not concealed, as long as she is moving through places where visual penalties might apply. If she is not concealed and not actively trying to stay concealed, this Charm no longer costs a point of [[Willpower]] to use. Crossing a range band with [[Shadow-Crossing Leap Technique]] always counts as the Exaltâ€™s movement action for the round. At [[Essence]] 6+, when concealed, the Exalt may move one range band per turn using this Charm, and an additional range band using her normal movement. This use always costs a point of [[Willpower]].
