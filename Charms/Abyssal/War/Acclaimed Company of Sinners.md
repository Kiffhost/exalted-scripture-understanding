*The deathknight recognizes the worthy among her ranks, marshalling a terrible force of elite killers.*
The Abyssal spends a scene commending a battle group whose members all have Ties from [[Loyal Unto Death]], praising their martial prowess, faithful service, or red-handed deeds. (Mindless battle groups can’t benefit from such praise.) As long as the battle group’s members maintain their Ties, it gains the following benefits in combat:
 - +1 base [[Initiative]].
 - +1 [[Resolve]]. This increases to +2 [[Resolve]] against fear-based influence or influence opposed by their Ties of loyalty.
 - The Abyssal’s command actions treat the battle group’s [[Drill]] as one step higher to determine how it affects the roll (Exalted, p. 207). If it already has elite [[Drill]], the dice added are converted to non-Charm successes.
 - It’s immune to penalties from fatigue and deprivation.
 - Its rout checks don’t suffer increased difficulty from allied battle groups or leaders being defeated.
The Abyssal may stack the Charm to enhance up to ([[Essence]]) battle groups.
## Special activation rules
This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if the Abyssal uses it to conclude Hardened Killer Training Style’s regimen.
