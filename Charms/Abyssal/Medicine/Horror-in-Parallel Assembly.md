*Ever efficient in her craft, the Abyssal necrosurgeon swiftly stitches together hordes of shambling monstrosities.*
The Abyssal can pay a five-mote surcharge when she uses Life-Mocking Assembly, Necrotic Graft Technique, or Superior Necrosurgeon Methodology, letting her apply those Charms’ benefits to up to (Essence x5) animated corpses. This doesn’t increase the time needed to complete the surgery.
If the Abyssal has access to a well-stocked surgical theater and numerous assistants, she can instead pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to apply the enhanced Charm to enough corpses to form a battle group of up to Size (Essence). This takes one day, plus an additional day for each dot of Size over 2.
This Charm is incompatible with Ivory Whirlwind Restoration — the Abyssal’s superior speed is already factored into its effect.
