Cholera is contracted from drinking water contaminated with filth or cursed by angry water-spirits, or by eating marine life caught in such tainted waters. Victims suffer fever or a constant, watery diarrhea, eventually dying of dehydration unless they receive fluids and medicine. Cholera can become epidemic in rural villages without a sanitary source of water, as the excrement of the disease taints the same rivers that the villagers drink from.
