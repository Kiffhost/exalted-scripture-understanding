Once per scene, the sorcerer can draw power from cackling, screaming, cacophonous music, or otherwise producing meaningless noises at the loudest volume she can. As long as any creature hears her, she gains three sorcerous motes that last until the end of the scene. If this causes a significant character to flee, avoid, or chastise the sorcerer, she gains (Charisma) additional sorcerous motes.
