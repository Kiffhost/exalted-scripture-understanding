*Striking quick, rapid jabs to nerve clusters and pressure points, the martial artist leave her foes numbed and deadened, as if they had actually been bitten by a venomous snake.*
Crippling Pressure-Point Strike allows the Snake stylist to use one of the following gambits, crippling vital pressure points and disrupting meridians of Essence with painful fang strikes.
- **Blinding Fang Strike** (Difficulty 3): A finger-fang strike to each of the enemy’s eyes leaves him blinded for the rest of the scene. The enemy suffers a -3 penalty on all actions. He may recover his sight by spending a turn rubbing his injured eyes, a miscellaneous action which cannot be placed in a flurry.  
- **Nerve-Deadening Venom Atemi** (Difficulty 4): A lightning-swift flurry of fang strikes along an arm leaves it paralyzed until the end of the scene. The victim immediately drops anything he was holding in that hand, cannot use it to perform any actions, and suffers a -2 penalty on any actions that would normally require the use of both hands. It is possible to paralyze both (or sometimes, all) of an enemy’s arms with repeated use of this gambit, leaving him unable to wield weapons at all without clever stunting on his part.  
- **Withering Venom Paralysis** (Difficulty 6): A single devastating fang strike to an enemy’s sacral chakra leaves his lower body paralyzed or the rest of the scene, causing him to immediately fall prone. Even on a successful rise from prone action (which must always be rolled, against difficulty 3), he is only capable of propping himself up on arms and elbows to crawl across the earth. He may take other movement actions at a -3 penalty, and treats all ground as difficult terrain, but still suffers all other penalties of being prone. 
## Terrestrial
In order to use this Charm, a Dragon-Blood must first successfully dodge a decisive attack. On her next turn, she may take advantage of the opening in the attacking enemy’s defense to unleashing the Crippling Pressure-Point Strike against him. Withering Venom Paralysis cannot be used.
