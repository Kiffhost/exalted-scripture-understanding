Touching a surface, the Dragon-Blood displaces her sense of hearing through the [[Essence]] of earth. She can listen through that barrier as though it weren’t there. Obstructions made of stone, wood, or weaker materials don’t require a roll to hear through, while metal or similarly durable materials may require a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll at difficulty 3+. On a failed roll, she’s only able to hear fragments of conversation or certain noises determined by the Storyteller with this Charm for the rest of the scene.
