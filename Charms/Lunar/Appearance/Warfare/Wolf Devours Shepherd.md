*Chaos breaks across the battlefield as the Lunar comes into view.*
When an enemy takes a [[command]] action targeting a [[battle group]] that can see the Lunar, he suffers a −(her [[Appearance]] − his [[Resolve]]) penalty, minimum −1. If he fails, he loses [[Initiative]] (which the Lunar doesn’t gain) equal to the 1s on his roll and the [[battle group]] suffers a −3 penalty on all actions until its next turn ends. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
