*The Abyssal deals out death with unerring accuracy.*
The Abyssal calculates the accuracy of a withering attack as though she were attacking from close range (Exalted, pp. 587, 597). When attacking from close range, she instead inflicts a −1 Defense penalty.
When used with Crypt Bolt Attack (p. XX), the Abyssal calculates its accuracy as if attacking at short range.
She inflicts the Defense penalty against enemies at short range, but not close range.
