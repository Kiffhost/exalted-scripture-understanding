*The Abyssal melts into the air, becoming nothing more than dark, chill fog.*
The Abyssal dissolves into a cloud of fog, with the following effects:
 - She gains +2 [[Defense|Evasion]]. With an appropriate stunt, she can dodge unblockable attacks.
 - She can’t take physical actions except for dodging, [[Stealth]] rolls, and movement actions, as well as [[Charms]] like [[Breath-Seizing Mist]] that are explicitly compatible. She’s still able to speak.
 - In combat, she can move two range bands on her turn as an action that can’t be flurried. She can do so reflexively on the turn she uses this Charm.
 - She can hover up to close range above the ground, letting her float over difficult terrain and certain [[environmental hazards]] unimpeded. She can’t cross running water.
 - She can pass through doors, walls, and other obstructions as long as they aren’t airtight or magically warded against such intrusion.
 - She’s immune to decisive damage unless its source is enhanced by magic, based on heat or cold, or benefits from an appropriate stunt. Even then, decisive damage rolls against her subtracts ([[Essence]]) successes unless they’re based on heat or cold.
 - [[Grappling]] her is impossible without appropriate magic.
The Abyssal must pay one [[Initiative]] at the start of each of her subsequent turns or this Charm ends. It also ends if she’s crashed.
