*Bringing Sunset Blaze’s fiery reproach to bear against an enemy general, the wielder proves her superiority to the armies on both sides.*
She adds dice equal to the [[Size]] of the largest allied battle group in the fight on the attack and damage roll of a decisive attack. An enemy damaged by this attack suffers a penalty (maximum –5) on his command actions and influence rolls equal to the levels of damage dealt for the rest of the scene. This ends if he crashes or incapacitates the wielder.
## Dissonant
This Evocation doesn’t add dice of damage.
## Resonant
A damaged enemy can’t make any command actions or influence rolls until the end of his next turn.
