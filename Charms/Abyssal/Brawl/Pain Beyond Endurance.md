*Striking without regard for anything but breaking her victim, the deathknight floods his mind with pain.*
The Abyssal makes an unsoakable withering attack.
She doesn’t gain Initiative from the damage roll — instead, for every four Initiative she’d gain, her enemy’s wound penalty increases by −1 until the start of her next turn.
With an Essence 3 repurchase, the Abyssal gains Initiative from the damage roll.
