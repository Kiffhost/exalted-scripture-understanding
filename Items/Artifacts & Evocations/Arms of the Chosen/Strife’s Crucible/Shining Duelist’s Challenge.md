Truth in Strife Riposte Radiating deadly intent with her battle stance, the wielder exudes an aura of terror that prevents any interference in her duel. This Evocation upgrades Majestic Radiant Presence (Exalted, p. 370). The Solar’s chosen opponent is unaffected by it, but all other enemies must pay three Willpower instead of one to resist. If the wielder attacks any character other than her chosen opponent, she loses this benefit.
