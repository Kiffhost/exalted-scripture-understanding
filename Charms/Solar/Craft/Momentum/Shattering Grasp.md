An Exalt with this Charm knows the strengths and weaknesses of her chosen materials and may rend them down with a mixture of light, precise touches and wringing blows. She may rend apart stone with her hands, destroy a door by crossing it with her palms and may disassemble a steel portcullis with her fingertips. The two former examples represent basic tasks, while the latter represents a major project. In any case, she needs no tools to perform such tasks, only an appropriate [[Craft]] Ability and a few moments time. Disassembly does not accrue the Exalt any craft points, though if she uses the rent material to build new objects or to repair the ones she has damaged, she may earn craft points accordingly.
