*The Solar’s preternatural awareness of her surroundings makes her nearly impossible to harm.*
Even when struck unaware, she may part herself from her foe’s attack, undoing the damage that was done to her. This Charm may be activated in response to an ambush attack, a trap, or other damaging effect the Solar is completely unaware of, setting her [[Defense|Evasion]] to two against the attack and adding an additional point of [[Defense|Evasion]] for every 1 or 2 in the attack (before [[Charms]] such as [[Excellent Strike]]). If the Solar’s [[Defense|Evasion]] recovers to its full value, she may apply additional [[Dodge]] [[Charms]] if necessary.
