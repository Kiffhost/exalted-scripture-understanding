*Speaking the name of the Tragedian of Flame Undaunted, the sorcerer transforms standing water into a conflagration of devil-fire that burns unnatural deepest crimson.*

The sorcerer targets a body of water within (Perception x 50) miles that she can perceive, setting its surface ablaze. The flames extend out to (Essence x 5) miles from a chosen point within range — enough to set all but the widest parts of its greatest rivers aflame from bank to bank. In a standing body like a lake, the flames are content to burn merrily until the spell’s end; in running water, they flow downstream or with the tide like a raft of fire. No matter how hot the fires burn, the water around them won’t evaporate.

The inferno created by this spell is hotter than any bonfire, an environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 5L/round. The flames don’t extend beneath the water’s surface, but the superheated water them is scarcely any better, a hazard with difficulty 3, Damage 3L/round. Even characters who aren’t directly exposed to the flame or boiling water, such as those aboard a ship, must still contend with incredible heat, a hazard with difficulty 3, Damage 1B/minute. (Only the most severe hazard applies.)

Mundane ships are all but lost. The inferno is a marine hazard with difficulty 7 that inflicts (sorcerer’s Essence) levels of Hull damage on a failed roll (Exalted, p. 244-245). Rolls to navigate the hazard fail automatically unless enhanced by magic or if the ship in question is an artifact or magically reinforced. The number of rolls needed to escape is based on the distance to be travelled, as usual.

The sorcerer is unharmed by these flames, as is any vessel she’s aboard.
# Control
Raindrops and sweat shed off the sorcerer as crimson sparks, and her tears are painless fire. When casting this spell, she may shelter any number of individuals or vessels from it, halving any damage they take from the environmental hazards, rounded down. Once per scene, she may take an unrolled Shape Sorcery action and pay one Willpower to ignite a smaller body of self-contained water that spans no more than (Essence/2, rounded up) range bands, such as a fountain, pond, or small reservoir, dealing damage as per a bonfire.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 20)
The flames abate, decreasing all hazards’ difficulty by one and damage by two. Alternatively, a distorting sorcerer may render himself immune to the spell’s hazards. If he’s aboard a ship, he can also protect it and any characters he chooses within long range of it.
