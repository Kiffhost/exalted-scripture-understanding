*An arrow of pure malice flies from the Abyssal’s bow, and those struck by it feel their flesh, blood, and Essence scream in torment.*
The Abyssal makes a withering attack against an enemy within short range, adding her Initiative to its raw damage. This resets her Initiative to base, though she still gains Initiative from the attack as usual.
If the Abyssal’s Initiative is at least ten higher than her target’s, the added damage is post-soak.
With Essence 4, if this crashes its target, he suffers (Abyssal’s Essence) dice of lethal decisive damage, ignoring Hardness, as his heart seizes from fear.
