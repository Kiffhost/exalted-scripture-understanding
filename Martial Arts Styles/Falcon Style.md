# [[Falcon Style]]
Falcon style is a high-flying art, its practitioners leaping across the battlefield to deliver powerful strikes or claim elevated vantages from which to deliver the finishing blow. In addition to attacks executed in midair, the style makes heavy use of grappling, locking enemies into painful submission holds or throwing them to the ground before executing punishing follow-ups. Its techniques are showy and spectacular, and many Falcon stylists draw flocks of bystanders to their fights — whether they’re wandering folk heroes or ruthlessly dishonorable brutes. Falcon style is most prominent in the South, although iconic masters have spread it to other directions.
## Weapons
Falcon style’s unarmed attacks use all four limbs and headbutts. It’s compatible with the [[Cestus]], [[Iron Boots]], [[Tiger Claws]], and medium or heavy improvised weapons that deal bashing damage. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced by Falcon [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage. 
## Armour
Falcon style is compatible with light armor.
## Complementary Abilities
Falcon stylists use [[Athletics]] and [[Dodge]] for battlefield maneuverability
