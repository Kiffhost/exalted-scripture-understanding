*Seven Widows Venom Veins of pink-and-crimson [[Essence]] flash across Spring Razor’s edge as it makes a fateful cut, granting its target the gifts of beauty and death.*
After being successfully struck with this attack, flowers begin to slowly appear and blossom across the target’s body. On each of the target’s subsequent turns, these flowers lessen the duration of all poisons afflicting the target by 1, and grow closer to achieving full bloom. After consuming four intervals of poison, the flowers unfurl and flood the victim’s system with concentrated, [[Essence]]-enriched toxins, immediately inflicting poison damage equal to twice the damage they prevented by consuming intervals of active poisons. If the victim has no poison intervals in his system for the flowers to consume, their growth stalls. In either case, they sublimate into [[Essence]] at the end of the scene. This Evocation can’t be directed against the same target twice in a scene.
