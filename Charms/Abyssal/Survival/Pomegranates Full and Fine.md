*Death’s Lawgiver knows the wilderness, procuring nourishing viands even amidst the Underworld’s most barren reaches.*
The Abyssal rolls ({Perception or Wits} + Survival) to forage for food. The difficulty is set by the Storyteller based on the terrain the deathknight forages in.
Success lets her find enough to feed herself for a day, plus an additional person for each extra success. Even on a failed roll, or if the Storyteller determines there is no sustenance available, she is able to somehow find enough food for one person.
Characters who are unfamiliar with the Abyssal gain a Minor Tie toward her if they partake in these provisions, unless they resist for one Willpower. The affected character’s player chooses whether the Tie is one of awe, fear, or respect. If the Abyssal uses this Charm within shadowlands or the Underworld, she may choose to have the living gain a Minor Principle representing fascination with the Underworld instead.
