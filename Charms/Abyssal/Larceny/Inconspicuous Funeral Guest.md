*Shrouded in subtle portents of the grave, the deathknight moves unnoticed through the herd of the living.*
The Abyssal can benefit from trappings of death even if they’re so subtle that noticing them — or their morbid significance — requires a roll of up to difficulty 7. When a character makes such a roll, his 1s subtract successes. Trivial characters fail automatically.
If the Abyssal uses a disguise to impersonate someone who’s already dead, she counts as wearing trappings of death.
With [[Larceny]] 5, [[Essence]] 2, opposing rolls’ 2s also subtract successes.
