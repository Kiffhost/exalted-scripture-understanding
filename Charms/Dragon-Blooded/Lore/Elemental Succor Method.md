*Understanding the harmonious flow of elemental [[Essence]] through the human body, the Dragon-Blood may direct it to heal her wounds.*
This Charm upgrades [[Elemental Empowerment Meditation]]. The Exalt may exchange five motes granted by it to heal a single level of non-aggravated damage. If she knows [[Dragon-Kin Empowerment]] and guides another Dragon-Blood through the meditation, he may likewise heal this way.
