The sorcerer shapes foam and aqueous reflections into a simulacrum of reality. From nothing, she may create a lifelike, convincing water-replica of a person, an animal up to the size of a horse, or an object up to the size of a wagon. She rolls (Manipulation + Occult) to determine the quality of the illusion. The illusion performs lifelike motions, is capable of simple speech, and has scent, body heat, and other sensory qualia, though it’s not capable of taking actions that require rolls. While the sorcerer is present, she may direct the illusion’s behavior; if she goes further than long range from it, it reverts to a default pattern of behavior that is realistic but uncomplicated. A character within short range can roll (Perception + Awareness) opposing the sorcerer’s initial roll to realize its illusory nature. Touching the eidolon’s water-sculpted surface grants three bonus dice on this roll. A character who speaks with the eidolon may realize it’s illusory by reading its intentions, opposing the sorcerer’s initial roll. A sorcerer with this as her control spell may create up to (Manipulation) separate illusions each time she casts it. Distortion (Goal number: 10): Distorting this spell allows the opposing sorcerer to wrest control of the illusion away from the sorcerer who cast it.
