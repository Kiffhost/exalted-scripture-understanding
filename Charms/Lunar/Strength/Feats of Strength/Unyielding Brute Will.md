Planting her feet, the Lunar defies the world to move her. She automatically succeeds on a feat of strength to maintain a damaged structure’s integrity or to hold a moving object still, e.g., holding up a temple’s roof in place of a shattered pillar or preventing a yeddim from stampeding by seizing the chains fixed to its yoke. She ignores the feat’s Strength minimum. She can even prevent uncountable damage with appropriate feats, such as holding up a chunk of mountain dropped on her by a behemoth. She can’t use this Charm if she’s taken a move action this round. The Lunar can maintain a feat enabled by this Charm by reactivating it for five motes on subsequent turns. She can continue doing so for the scene’s duration, so long as she doesn’t take move actions. This Charm can only be used once per day, except for subsequent activations as described above. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Beast of Burden or Legendary Size, the Lunar waives the cost of subsequent activations. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Beast of Burden can learn this as a Stamina Charm, with Moonsilver Thew Exertion (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
