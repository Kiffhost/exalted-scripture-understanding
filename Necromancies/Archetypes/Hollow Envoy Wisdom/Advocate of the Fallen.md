*When the necromancer makes a promise, negotiates a deal, or otherwise mediates with an undead being, she may hallow her word, gaining (3 + his [[Essence]]) necromantic motes that she may use on spells that further that promise or which resonate with his nature and passions.*
These motes refresh at midnight until she fulfills her promise. She may keep only one such hallowed promise at a time.
