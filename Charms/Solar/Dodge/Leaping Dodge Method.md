The Exalt feels the coursing [[Essence]] of Creation moving through her. With a thought, she grasps the flow and is carried away. Upon a successful [[Dodge]], the Solar may invoke this Charm, burning her momentum to create a sudden burst of movement. She may leap backward, forward, up or down (if applicable) a single range band.
