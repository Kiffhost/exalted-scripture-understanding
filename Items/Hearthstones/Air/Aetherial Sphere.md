This clear, perfect sphere seems to swirl with prismatic facets when viewed from different angles. If the owner knows the Charm Terrestrial Circle Sorcery, this hearthstone grants knowledge of one spell of the Terrestrial Circle (excluding
Demon of the First Circle or Summon Elemental) while placed in an attuned socket. Once a spell has been cast using this hearthstone, it remains imprinted on the hearthstone until the owner learns to cast the spell on her own.
