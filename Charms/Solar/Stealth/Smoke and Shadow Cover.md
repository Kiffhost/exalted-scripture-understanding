*The Exalt is at one with the shadows, drawing safety from even the most intangible concealment.*
While this Charm is active, the Solar treats concealment as cover. 
Mild concealment (such as hiding in partially obscuring shadows, behind light foliage, or in obscuring fog) is treated as light cover, while heavy concealment (such as deep, full-body covering shadows, undergrowth that  obscures all but the character’s eyes, or thick, opaque smoke) is treated as heavy cover. Completely pitch-black, lightless environments count as full cover. 
Using concealment as cover requires a take cover combat action (see p.198) replacing Dodge with [[Stealth]] unless the character is already concealed. In that case, her hiding place counts as cover until she moves out of it or something happens to obviate it, such as flames banishing the shadows she’s crouched in. 
Furthermore, this Charm also penalizes non-ranged attacks by one success in addition to any dice penalties the attack might accrue from fighting in low visibility conditions.
