Issuing an order is a ({Charisma, Appearance, or Intelligence} + War) roll against difficulty 1. Intelligence is used by rear line characters who are not actively participating in the battle, generally characters protected somewhere behind the [[battle group]] they’re issuing orders to. Charisma and Appearance are used to lead from the front, by characters actively participating in the battle. Charisma directs troops through impromptu speeches and valorous exhortations, while Appearance leads by example, such as charging at the enemy while calling for troops to follow. An order action both determines what the targeted battle group will do on its next turn and adds its successes to the battle group’s dice pools for all actions taken during that turn.
