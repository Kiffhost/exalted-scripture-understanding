The Dragon-Blood’s mastery of speech and language is synonymous with her mastery of deception. She rolls ([Manipulation or Intelligence] + [[Linguistics]]) to create a coded message, designating a single character who can understand it. Through her insight into his mind, she devises a cipher that he can intuitively read — for him, the symbols on the page seem to rearrange themselves to spell out the hidden message. For others, deciphering the message, even with code-breaking magic, requires a ([Perception or Intelligence] + [[Linguistics]]) roll opposing the Dragon-Blood’s initial roll. Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood may draw from one of her Principles to create a code that can be intuitively understood by any character who shares that [[Intimacy]].
