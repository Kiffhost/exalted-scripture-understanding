Socketed in an attuned artifact, this red-speckled green gem protects and purifies its bearer’s blood. She gains the Natural Immunity and Toxin Resistance merits (Exalted, pp. 164-165), and doubles 7s against nonmagical diseases and poisons. In addition, her wounds never get infected, nor do they bleed — even severed limbs won’t cause blood loss.
