*No scrap of carrion or splinter of bone is beneath the Abyssal artisan’s notice, imbuing her work with deathly power.*
The Abyssal excels in making use of the dead as raw materials: forging armor from iron mixed with bonecoal, tanning a beast’s hide for a cloak, tempering a freshly-made daiklave by using it to execute a living prisoner, etc. So long as such materials form an essential component of a project, she only needs two extra successes to trigger an increased [[Craft]] reward on basic and major projects (Exalted, pp. 240-241).
A project can only benefit from one slain character, and a character’s remains can only enhance one project.
Additionally, when the Abyssal uses a nontrivial character’s remains for a major project, the cost for her first roll is reduced by (victim’s [[Essence]]) silver points. If she killed him herself, it’s reduced by (applicable [[Craft]]) points, if that’s higher.
With [[Craft]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal can enhance superior projects using the remains of supernatural beings. She reduces the first roll’s gold point cost by (victim’s Essence/2, rounded up). She doesn’t halve her victim’s [[Essence]] if she killed him herself. Creating soulsteel artifacts always qualifies for this benefit, treating soulforged ghosts as [[Essence]] 1 unless they’ve already been established as characters.
