The necromancer treats her [[Appearance]] as one higher for determining bonus dice on [[persuade]] rolls to draw someone towards her. Once per session, she may declare that an unExalted undead with [[Essence]] lower than (her [[Appearance]]/2, rounded up) is automatically enchanted by her, gaining a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fascination, attraction, or awe of their playerâ€™s choice.
