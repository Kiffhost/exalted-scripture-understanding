The Lunar steals the safety of home, and with it, identity. She performs a sacred hunt to claim an animal or human shape by infiltrating a place her target considers home: a peasant’s hovel, a Dynast’s estate, a wolf’s den, etc. To do so, she must be in the home at the same time as her target, escape without being captured, and do something that reveals the extent of her intrusion — stealing a precious heirloom, carving her name into a wall, leaving a letter scented with her favorite perfume, etc. — such that her victim forms a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her, or whoever he believes she is. If the Lunar is captured or retreats to avoid capture, the sacred hunt fails, and she can’t take her target’s shape through this Charm for the rest of the story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means.
