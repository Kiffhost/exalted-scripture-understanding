The Sidereal summons a bridle of stardust that transforms into a memorandum on saffron paper, bearing one line for her signature and another for her familiar’s. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Sidereal secures a promotion in the Celestial Bureaucracy for a familiar uplifted with Spirit-Shape Companion. The Sidereal’s player and the Storyteller should determine what role the Sidereal’s familiar receives. He gains the following benefits: 
-  He gains two-dot Backing in the bureau he’s promoted into. His official duties include accompanying the Sidereal, allowing him to remain by her side, but he may face occasional bureaucratic obligations. 
-  He gains two dots of Essence. 
-  His mote pool increases to ([Essence x10] + 50). 
-  He gains (Sidereal’s Essence) spirit Charms that reflect his new office or his animal origin. He gains additional Charms as the Sidereal’s Essence rises and one Charm at the end of any story in which he played a meaningful role. The Sidereal may purchase this Charm once for each of her qualifying familiars. If a familiar is permanently killed, the experience cost is refunded.
