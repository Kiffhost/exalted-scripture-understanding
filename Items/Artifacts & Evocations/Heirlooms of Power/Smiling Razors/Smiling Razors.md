Sesus Kalama, the Grinning Wicked Flame, received the Smiling Razors from the Empress for exceptional service in the Immaculate Order. She wielded them in many a Wyld Hunt, stalking Anathema as a flickering shadow and gouging painful burning wounds across their skin before dispatching them. Kalama loved the violence of the Wyld Hunt, but grew discontent with the life of a monk. She publicly decried the Order, igniting her anima to incinerate her robes and profaning an offering-laden Immaculate altar. She declared herself a force against those who clung too tightly to tradition and order, publicly challenging monks to duels so that she might demonstrate the fallibility of the Immaculate Texts, and seducing Dynasts into apostasy. There was only one word for what the Grinning Wicked Flame had become — Anathema. A Wyld Hunt was dispatched to hunt down the flame-devil, led by her cousin Sesus Bajo tracking her by the wake of blasphemy and fire she left across the Blessed Isle. Kalama fought fiercely, and maimed many of the shikari sent to kill her, but in the end, she fell. Her death became an object lesson to young Dragon-Blooded on the dangers of heresy, and the specter of the flame-devil lingered as a threat whispered to rebellious adults and disobedient children alike. Bajo retrieved the Smiling Razors from his cousin’s corpse to return them to his house. Though the cruel blades were ill-suited to his temperament, he made a show of wielding them publicly to cleanse the stain of Kalama’s blasphemy. Once the house deemed its reputation suitably repaired, the Smiling Razors were turned over to its vaults. House Sesus’ Masked Council has chosen subsequent wielders of the Smiling Razors, reforging Grinning Wicked Flame’s legacy into a weapon suited to their clandestine purposes.
