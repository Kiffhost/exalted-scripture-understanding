*The Abyssal corsair flies beneath a false flag, running blockades or raiding unwary ships.*
The deathknight rolls (Manipulation + Sail) to disguise her ship over the course of an hour, setting her crew to work altering the ship’s appearance or calling up waterlogged phantoms to serve. She can work drastic changes, even making it look like another kind of ship altogether, as long as it’s of roughly similar size.
This deception is usually perfect, but a character within medium range of the ship can see through it he has reason to be suspicious, rolling (Perception + {Lore or Sail}) opposing the Abyssal’s roll.
