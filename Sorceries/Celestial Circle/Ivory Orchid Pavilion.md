*As the sorcerer spends a few minutes tracing the borders of this spell with her footsteps, a spire of ivory rises from the ground like the calyx of an immense flower carved from marble.*
Once she completes the circuit, the central pillar unfurls its petals to reveal a splendid mansion. Ornate furniture, silk curtains, and fine beddings adorn the chambers of the palace, and the pleasant scent of fresh orchids is everywhere. Feasting tables within the mansion’s dining room are replete with fresh fruits and nuts and bowls of wine, never seeming to run empty, though vanishing if taken outside. 
Any character who enters the Ivory Orchid Pavilion and partakes of its amenities or sleeps within it is treated as having a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of blissful contentment towards dwelling within it until the end of his stay—most spirits and cultured sorcerers consider this a luxury rather than an imposition, relishing the chance to forget their troubles. 
Once this spell ends, the mansion folds back into the ground, safely depositing all guests outside. For five years after the casting of the spell, white orchids will grow from the ground where it was cast. 
## Control Spell
A sorcerer who knows [[Ivory Orchid Pavilion]] as her control spell may cast it with a duration of Indefinite. The mansion will remain standing for as long as she stays within it. 
## Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
Distorting an [[Ivory Orchid Pavilion]] subtly inverts the blissful atmosphere of the sanctum, transforming the [[Intimacy]] imposed by this spell into a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of suspicion and distrust of all other characters within the pavilion. This inversion lasts until it leads to a scene in which built-up suspicion comes to a head in a dramatic fashion.
