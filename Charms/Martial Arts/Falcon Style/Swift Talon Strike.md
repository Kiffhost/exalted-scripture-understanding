*Launching herself at a foe, the stylist sharpens her talons with momentum and Essence.* 
To use this Charm, she must move into close range with an enemy and attack him on the same turn, adding an automatic success on the attack roll. She rerolls 1s until they cease to appear on the damage roll or the control roll of a grapple. If the stylist moved downward to reach close range, she rerolls 2s as well as 1s. 
## Mastery
If the stylist moved downward to reach close range, the success added to the attack roll is non-Charm.
