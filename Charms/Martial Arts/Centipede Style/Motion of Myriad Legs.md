The stylist’s limbs whirl with hundredfold striking force. She makes up to (higher of Essence or 3, maximum 5) decisive attacks against one enemy. She divides her Initiative evenly among all attacks, rounded up, and must assign 3+ Initiative to each attack. If at least one attack deals damage, the target’s onslaught penalty doesn’t refresh on his next turn. 
## Terrestrial

The stylist subtracts one from the total number of attacks she can make, and rounds down when dividing Initiative among attacks.
