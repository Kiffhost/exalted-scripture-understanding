*Filling her ship with a measure of her own unholy resilience, the deathknight preserves it against damage.*
The Abyssal negates all Hull damage that would be dealt to a ship by an attack, naval hazard, or similar peril. This protection extends out to short range from the Abyssal — if a threat specifically targets a portion of the ship outside of the area, this Charm can’t be used against it. If an area-of-effect attack or similar threat extends beyond the protected zone, this Charm offers diminished protection, halving the Hull damage dealt to the ship, rounded up.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm multiple times in the same scene against a single peril that causes recurring damage, she waives the Willpower cost of uses past the first.
With Essence 3, this Charm’s range extends to medium.
