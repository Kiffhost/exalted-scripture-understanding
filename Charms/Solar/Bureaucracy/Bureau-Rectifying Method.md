The Solar may use her bureaucratic prowess to reform an ailing or corrupt bureaucracy. The Lawgiver must participate in an investigation of the organization, attending or leading inquiries, reviewing records and interviewing involved parties. For the duration of the inquest, add the Solar’s Bureaucracy in automatic successes to her Investigation and Socialize rolls to conduct this investigation. In addition, while this Charm is in effect, members of the organization will automatically perceive the Solar as a subject of confidential trust with regards to the bureau— someone they should both confide in and should speak truthfully to. This registers as a Major Intimacy with most, but those with strong will and reasons to want to hide the truth will clock in with no more than a Minor Intimacy of respect for the Lawgiver’s authority.
