After making an (Attribute + [[Craft]]) roll, this Charm may be invoked to add a supernatural burst of precision, skill, and inspiration to the Solar’s hands. This Charm allows the Exalt to purchase a number of additional non-Charm successes equal to ([her Essence] + successes) on the initial roll. This Charm does not factor in “double numbers” effects from other [[Charms]]. If the Lawgiver is using a double 9s effect, and rolls three 9s and no other successes, she would be able to purchase ([[Essence]] + 3) successes, not ([[Essence]] + 6).
