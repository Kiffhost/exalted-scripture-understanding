It often isn’t safe for a Lawgiver to hang out her shingle. Meditatingonthebusinesssheseeks,theSolarexpandsher Essence outward so that it may guide troubled customers toherdoor.ThisCharmcoversacityblockfromtheSolar’s position, and will guide customers with financial or mercantile problems to the Exalt’s location, even going so far as to lead them through hidden alleys and secret doors to do so. When activating the Charm, the Solar must be very specific about which kind of customers she will attract based on their Resources rating. The player can specify customers with “financial problems and Resources 5”, “multiple Resources 5 who need to deposit vast sums of money”, “a valuation inquiry and any Resources rating”, and so on. As long as the Solar’s net isn’t cast extremely wide, as soon as a person with the designated problem steps into the area affected by her Essence they will be drawn to her. Note that an arriving customer won’t exactly understand why they’ve been drawn to the Solar or how it was done. It’s up to the Solar to recognize the customer, figure out what their problem is, and impress them with her expertise and preeminence in all things commercial. 

## Special activation rules

If the Solar knows the Larceny Charm Seasoned Criminal Method, the player may use this Charm to specify targets with “Larceny problems difficulty 1-5” or of one specific difficulty. The player may also combine specifications: “a subject with Resources 5 that has a difficulty 5 Larceny problem.”

### On Pattern-Exploiting Commerce Spirit

The backer’s favorite Caste is Eclipse, and their favorite Ability is Bureaucracy, so I decided to make them a very mystical, extremely useful Charm for Solars trying to operate in the shadow economy or who are simply trying to be very exclusive. Readers might be interested to know that the J.P. Morgan banking dynasty began with banking services catering only to the ultra rich, usually exclusively to trade organizations. They never advertised, and never opened up more than a single office in one country, and that exclusivity elevated them to a nigh-mythic stature. A Solar dealing in gigantic sums of capital, troubleshooting economic problems and providing legal services can become an even greater subject of myth, and even more sought after. This Charm also helps the Solar to protect herself, since direct advertisement or street-side storefronts aren’t always safe. Players should note that this Charm is bound to be more effective in busy trade districts of bustling cities. If you use this Charm in the dusty village of some half-dry desert watering hole, you might not have much luck attracting customers. Backer: Jordan Neal
