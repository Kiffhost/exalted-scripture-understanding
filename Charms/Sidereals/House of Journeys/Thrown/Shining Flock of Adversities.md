*Promising that things can always be worse, the Sidereal causes a weapon embedded in her foe to dissolve into a golden whirlwind, drawing in stray arrows, stones and debris, and the occasional small animal.*
The Sidereal makes an undodgeable ([[Wits]] + [[Thrown]]) withering or decisive attack against an enemy afflicted by [[Life-Gets-Worse Approach]] and all other enemies within short range of him. The primary target suffers damage normally if hit; secondary targets suffer ([[Essence]]) dice of withering or decisive damage, ignoring soak and [[Hardness]]. Such withering damage doesn’t award [[Initiative]]. Secondary targets can’t suffer more damage than the primary target. On a withering attack, she can’t gain more than ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] from Any attack roll. On a decisive attack, each damage roll has ([[Wits]]) base damage and divide the Sidereal’s [[Initiative]] evenly among them, rounded up, to determine their damage. If her primary target is crashed or suffers 3+ decisive damage, the embedded weapon dissolves into his [[Essence]], becoming impossible to remove for the scene. If the Sidereal has any familiars within short range of the primary target, she may have them be drawn into close range of him. One of her familiars may reflexively make an attack against him: withering if the Sidereal’s was decisive, or vice versa. This counts as its attack for the round, or the next round if it’s already attacked.
