Attuning her senses to the subtle flow of water and Essence, the Dragon-Blood spies from the depths. While submerged in a body of water such as a lake or river, she may displace her sense of hearing to another point within the same body of water no more than (Essence) range bands away from her. She’s able to hear everything around the chosen point as though she were physically there. She doubles 9s on Awareness rolls she makes through the water, as well as on Socialize rolls to read the intentions of characters she’s eavesdropping on. This Charm doesn’t enable the Dragon-Blood to breathe underwater, requiring her to hold her breath or use magic such as the Water Aspect anima power (p. 155) or Unbreathing Earth Meditation (p. 248) to make extended use of it.
