*The vizier need not act to seize victory; the lessons she’s imparted to her shadow fingers have already ensured her triumph.*
The stylist can enhance the attacks of shadow fingers present in the same scene with the following techniques: 
In Throne Shadow Form, if the stylist enhances an attack with multiple techniques with Willpower costs, she need only pay one Willpower. 
### Deadliest of All Weapons (5m, 1wp; Reflexive; Dual)
After a shadow finger’s withering attack crashes an enemy or his decisive attack hits, the stylist asks that enemy one question, to which he must respond truthfully (in character) unless he spends one Willpower. Incapacitated enemies answer before succumbing to their wounds. 
### Flow-Breaking Strike (2m, 1wp; Supplemental; Decisive-only)
Each 9 and 10 on a decisive attack also causes the enemy to lose one Initiative, which the shadow finger doesn’t gain.
### Pneuma-Sealing Strike (5m; Reflexive; Withering-only)
After a withering damage roll, the shadow finger can forgo up to (his Essence + stylist’s Essence) Initiative awarded by it. Each point of Initiative forgone reduces the number of motes regained by the damaged enemy at the end of the round by one. If this exceeds the amount he’d recover, the excess is applied to the next round’s recovery. 
### Welcoming the Uninvited Guest (3m; Supplemental; Uniform)
The shadow finger can attack an enemy he’s unaware of as long as the stylist is aware of him and has beaten his Stealth, if applicable.
## Mastery
The stylist’s shadow fingers can pay the cost of these techniques instead of her. 
## Terrestrial Reset
This Charm’s minimum Essence increases to 4. Each of its techniques can only be used once per scene, unless reset when a shadow finger lands a decisive attack that resets his Initiative and builds back to Initiative 15+. This resets all used techniques.
