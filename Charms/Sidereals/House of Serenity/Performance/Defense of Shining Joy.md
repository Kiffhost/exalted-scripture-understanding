*The Sidereal anticipates her enemyâ€™s every move as if they were dancing together, maneuvering gracefully in perfect counterpoint to his offense.*
The Sidereal adds (Appearance/2, rounded up) [[Defense|Evasion]] against an attack and dodges even if its successes equal her [[Defense|Evasion]]. Dodging a decisive attack grants her the [[Initiative]] her attacker loses for missing.
