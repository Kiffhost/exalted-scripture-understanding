*The martial artist sweeps across the battlefield like the East’s migrating thumbnail spiders, striking like thousands or millions of tiny, hungry spiders devouring all they swarm over.*
The stylist moves up to two range bands, or three range bands if Dance of the Hungry Spider is active. At the conclusion of her movement, she makes a single undodgeable decisive attack roll against each enemy she came within range of at any point during her movement. She rolls damage separately for each; each attack has (Initiative/2, rounded up) damage dice. This attack can’t be clashed, nor can counterattacks be used against it; the death of a single spider doesn’t harm the swarm. This counts as the stylist’s movement action for the turn.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used once per scene unless reset when the stylist takes a movement action to come within close range of at least three nontrivial enemies while she has Initiative 20+.
## Enlightenment
The stylist’s attacks can strike dematerialized enemies. If the stylist is dematerialized — using Unnatural Many-Step Stride or other magic — she can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to strike materialized targets with it.
