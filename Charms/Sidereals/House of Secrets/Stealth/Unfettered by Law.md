*Laws apply only to those who exist — a loophole easily exploited by a canny Sidereal.*
No matter what the Sidereal does or how she behaves, nothing she does will be seen as violating any laws. This extends to secondhand accounts and physical evidence of such acts, even after this Charm ends. This doesn’t prevent others from taking offense at the Sidereal’s crimes if they have other reasons to do so — they simply won’t view it as a criminal matter. As a result, such acts generally won’t be reported to authorities, nor will the Sidereal face legal consequences.
This Charm’s scope encompasses any rule, regulation, or obligation that’s officially imposed by a political leader, governing body, or an analogous authority. It doesn’t apply to informal rules like social expectations.
Nor does it cover acts committed while this Charm isn’t active, such as any misdeeds the Sidereal may confess to while using it.
If the Sidereal commits an act that offends one of a nontrivial character’s Major or Defining Intimacies, he may pay three Willpower to resist. Nontrivial characters with an opposed Defining Intimacy involving justice or law may always do so.
Additionally, the Sidereal is shrouded from the law’s eyes. She gains the following benefits against anyone actively engaged in enforcing the law, like a prince’s hired enforcers, a city watchman, or a lion-dog
- Once per scene, she can add a free full Excellency on a Larceny or Stealth roll as long as the only nontrivial characters who oppose her roll are enforcers of law.
- She can use Blinding the Boar against all such - Privacy-Enhancing Gesture inflicts +2 target number against such characters, not +1.
- Walking Outside Fate doesn’t end if the Sidereal takes overt action or lets her anima reach burning or higher, as long the only nontrivial witnesses are enforcers of law.
(Allies don’t count as witnesses for this).
Resisting this Charm’s Psyche effect doesn’t render such characters immune to the above effects.
