*Sheathing her bloodied blade, the Sidereal gives a command to her defeated foes that can’t be disobeyed.*
After defeating one or more foes, the Sidereal makes a ({Appearance or Charisma} + Battles Ability) persuade roll against them, ignoring multiple target penalties and adding a free full Excellency against all defeated enemies. The defeat need not be in battle: athletic competition, debate, and the like also count. The defeat counts as a supporting Intimacy with an intensity based on its severity:
### Minor
The defeat doesn’t cause any significant setback for enemies other than their injuries: an ordinary sparring bout, drunken brawl, friendly footrace, petty argument, etc.
### Major
The defeat is a consequential setback, though not a total loss: fending off thieves, a battle in a larger war, a competition with a significant prize at stake, etc.
### Defining
The defeat thwarts an enemy’s agenda, plans, or other overall goals: decisively defeating forces laying siege to a city, assassinating a bodyguard’s charge, swaying the public to despise a once-influential demagogue, etc.
Resisting the command in a Decision Point costs two Willpower but is only possible if a character used magic to defend against the influence or has an opposed Defining Tie.
