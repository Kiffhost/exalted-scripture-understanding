*The stylist’s weapons whirl into formation, forming a bladed aegis to fend off attack.*
The stylist gains +1 [[Defense|Parry]]. On a successful block, if her Arsenal equals or exceeds her current onslaught, that attack doesn’t inflict onslaught.
With Arsenal 3+ the [[Defense|Parry]] bonus is replaced by a +1 [[Defense]] bonus from light cover ([[Cover]] bonuses are non-Charm). This becomes a +2 bonus from heavy cover with Arsenal 5+.
## Mastery
If the stylist’s Arsenal equals or exceeds her current onslaught penalty, she can use this Charm after the attack roll.
