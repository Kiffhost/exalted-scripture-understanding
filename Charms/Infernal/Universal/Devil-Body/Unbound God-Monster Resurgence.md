*The Infernal’s inner demon can’t be caged for long, ripping itself free of her mortality with a monstrous roar.*

The Infernal can use this Charm to reset the once-per-story limit on using her Devil-Body when one of its trigger conditions is met during Calibration. She can then enter her Devil-Body in response to the trigger condition.

Additionally, the Infernal gains one of this Charm’s keys for free. Each provides another way of resetting her Devil-Body, as above.
## Reset
Once per session.
### Keys
#### Breaking Point Rampage
The Infernal can use this Charm when subjected to extreme duress or torment: being forced to act against a Defining Intimacy, being imprisoned under agonizing conditions, watching someone she has a Defining Tie of love for die, etc.
#### Hellish Eruption Unleashed
The Infernal’s Devil-Body resets when one of its trigger conditions is met while she’s in Limit Break.
#### Immortal Vengeance Apotheosis
The Infernal’s Devil-Body resets when she’s incapacitated by an enemy for whom she has a negative Defining Tie.
#### Triumphant Devil-Monster
The Infernal’s Devil-Body resets when she accomplishes a legendary social goal.
#### The Face of the Titans (Essence 5, any one key) (+20m, 1wp)
Once per story, the Infernal can pay a twenty-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm whenever one of her Devil-Body’s trigger conditions is met.
