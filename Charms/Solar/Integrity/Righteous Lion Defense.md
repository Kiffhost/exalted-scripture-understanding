Around a certain issue, the Solar cannot be moved, shaken, swayed or tempted. Upon purchasing this Charm, the player selects a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] that exemplifies the Solar in such a way that she should never act against it. Righteous Lion [[Defense]] allows the Exalt to treat any persuasion which would cause the Solar to act against the selected [[Intimacy|Principle]] as [[unacceptable influence]]. This effect may not be routed through principles that are overly broad. “I will never kneel,” is too broad, but “I will never kneel to Zhao Li,” is not. Likewise, “Creation must be conquered,” is too broad, while “Great Forks must be conquered” is not. The Solar’s zealous resolution daunts even the most relentless opposition. Any attempt to decay the inviolable [[Intimacy]] with an instill action must be rerolled, forcing the opponent to take the lower result. The opponent may enhance the second roll with additional [[Charms]] as necessary, but even if he’s able to penetrate the Solar’s [[Resolve]], the [[Intimacy]] still does not decay. However, success in this regard allows the Solar to be targeted with persuasion to convince her to act against the protected [[Intimacy]], and this weakness persists until she has taken major or defining action in the [[Intimacy|Principle]]’s defense. The Solar may always choose to act against her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], or change them. If her [[Intimacy|Principle]] is downgraded, destroyed, transformed or reconciled as a result of roleplaying or [[Limit Break]], this Charm ceases to function until the [[Intimacy]] is restored, or until the Solar dedicates herself to a new [[Intimacy|Principle]]. At [[Essence]] 3+, this Charm may be repurchased a single time, to protect one additional [[Intimacy|Principle]].
