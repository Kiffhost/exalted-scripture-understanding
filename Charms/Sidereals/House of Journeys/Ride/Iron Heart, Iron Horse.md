*The Sidereal masters her fear as forcefully as any stallion she’s broken, riding boldly onward into peril.*
The Sidereal and any mount she rides gain +1 Resolve, or +3 Resolve against fear-based influence. They don’t gain this bonus against influence that leverages any Intimacies of bravery they have.
If the Sidereal has an Intimacy of bravery, her steed gains it as well for this Charm’s duration and adds (Intimacy) dice on attack rolls and to its withering attack’s Overwhelming.
