The martial artist responds to attacks with speech and posture more suited to a friendly altercation or test bouts than a life-or-death struggle. She adds (Guile + 1) to her natural soak against a withering attack and reduces its Overwhelming value by one, or gains (Guile) Hardness against a decisive attack. This includes bonuses to her Guile from White Veil Form or other effects. If an attack fails to damage her (including if it misses), she may conceal it from onlookersâ€™ notice as per Owl Clutches at the Night. 
## Mastery

When the stylist successfully conceals an attack against her from all onlookers, she may steal (Manipulation) Initiative from her attacker.
