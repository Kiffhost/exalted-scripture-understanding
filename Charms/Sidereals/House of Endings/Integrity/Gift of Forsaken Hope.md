*Making a slashing motion with one hand, the Sidereal tears away a thread of her hopes and weaves it into a spirit’s Essence.*
The Sidereal imparts one of her hopeful Intimacies to a spirit, losing it herself and transferring the Intimacy to the spirit at its full intensity. Against unwilling spirits, this requires a special (Charisma + {Integrity or Presence}) instill roll, which she adds a free full Excellency on. This costs three Willpower to resist.
As long as the spirit has the Intimacy, both he and the Sidereal are subject to the following
- The Sidereal can’t voluntarily reform the Intimacy, be instilled with it, or otherwise regain it by any means.
- The Sidereal can still use the Intimacy to “pay” for effects that require her to weaken or sacrifice an Intimacy to use them, like Dream-Sacrificing Maneuver, drawing from the spirit.
- The spirit can’t voluntarily weaken the Intimacy unless he pays three Willpower per level. He adds (Sidereal’s Essence, maximum 5) Resolve against influence that would weaken or alter the Intimacy.
- The spirit gains Cult (Intimacy), nourished by the Sidereal’s hopes, or gains +1 Cult if his own rating is already equal or higher.
When this Charm ends, the Sidereal’s Intimacy returns from the spirit to her at its original intensity, while the spirit loses the Intimacy, if it still had it. This emotional transference isn’t instantaneous, taking until at least the end of the scene to occur.
