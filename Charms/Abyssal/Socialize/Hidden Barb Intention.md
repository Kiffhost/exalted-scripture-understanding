*With a false twitch or sly smile, the Abyssal conceals her wicked ways from would-be inquisitors.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a [[read intentions]] roll beats her [[Guile]], distorting the result. If the opposing character sought to discern her intentions, she chooses what they appear to be. If the opposing character sought to uncover an [[Intimacy]], she may reveal a warped version of it, changing a [[Intimacy|Tie]]â€™s context or the wording of a [[Intimacy|Principle]] to mislead him.
