*Guiding another through a journey of self-discovery and metamorphosis, the Lunar learns the secret truths of who her companion was and who he’s become.*
She performs a [[sacred hunt]] to claim a human’s shape by traveling alongside him for a journey, which must have some element of peril — harsh terrain, bandit-haunted roadways, wild beasts, etc. The Lunar’s prey must also undergo a moment of major change or character development by journey’s end: raising an [[Intimacy]] to Defining and then taking an action that upholds it; forsaking a person, group, or ideal toward which he had a Defining [[Intimacy]]; accomplishing a legendary social goal; etc. Once they reach journey’s end, the Lunar claims her companion’s form. If the Lunar abandons her companion before the journey’s end, or the journey concludes without the requisite peril or character development, the [[sacred hunt]] fails, and she can’t take his shape through this Charm for the rest of the story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means.
