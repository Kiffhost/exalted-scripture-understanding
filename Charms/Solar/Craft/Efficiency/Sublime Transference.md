Meditating calmly for five minutes, the Solar erases all thought and function; her conscious mind recedes to nothingness. During this time, the player may rearrange the Solarâ€™s crafting points in the following way: two silver points can become one gold point; two gold points can become one white point; one white point can become two gold points, and one gold point can become two silver points. However, each use of this Charm only allows the Solar to shift one type of experience to another; in five minutes, spending six motes, she could convert silver points to gold, but she would have to activate the Charm again to transfer gold points to white. The Exalt may activate this Charm while she is asleep or incapacitated.
