*FLYING SILVER DREAM [[Essence]]: (Exalt’s [[Essence]]); [[Willpower]]: (Exalt’s [[Willpower]]); [[Join Battle]]: 10 dice Combat: [[Attack]]: (10+Essence) dice (Damage 15, minimum 4) Combat movement: (10+Essence) dice [[Defense|Evasion]] 6, [[Defense|Parry]] 7 Soak/Hardness: (10+Essence)/(6+Essence) Special: Flying Silver Dream’s [[Willpower]] resets at the start of each combat.*
The sword’s fury knows no distance. When fighting independently, [[Flying Silver Dream]] can spend one [[Willpower]] to use [[Sandstorm-Wind Attack]] (Exalted, p. 350) against an opponent that’s dealt at least one health level of damage to the Exalt this combat, or toward whom the Exalt has a negative Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]]. If this attack deals damage, the sword gains one temporary [[Willpower]].
