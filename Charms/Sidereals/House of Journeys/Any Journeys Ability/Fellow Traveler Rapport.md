*The Sidereal comes to understand those who travel in her company, whether over a round of grog or around the campfire’s warmth.*
The Sidereal makes a special ([[Perception]] + {Resistance, [[Ride]], [[Sail]] [[Survival]], or Thrown}) read intentions roll against a character traveling on the same vehicle or along the same route as her. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
- Why is he making this journey? 
- Where’s he been that I should know about? 
- How prepared is he for the difficulties and dangers of this journey? 
- Where does he call home? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if [[introducing a fact]].
