*The thrill of murder urges the Abyssal onward to her next victim with incredible speed.*
After incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack, the deathknight can move one range band towards another nontrivial enemy. If she enters close range with him, she may reflexively make a decisive attack against him with ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) dice of damage.. This follow-up attack doesnâ€™t reset her [[Initiative]].
If the Abyssal uses this Charm multiple times in a single tick, she waives the [[Willpower]] cost of activations past the first.
