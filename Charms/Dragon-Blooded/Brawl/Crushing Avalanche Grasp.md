The Dragon-Blood’s grip is sure and unshakable as stone. If she hits an enemy with a grapple attack roll and successfully establishes a clinch, she doesn’t lose rounds of control over it from attacks against her that miss. In Earth Aura, attacks that hit her but fail to deal any damage also don’t cause her to lose rounds of control.
