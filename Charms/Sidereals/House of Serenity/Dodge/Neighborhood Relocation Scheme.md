*The Sidereal wraps a long prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Hunted Maiden around her waist, where it transforms into a crystalline band of sky-blue Essence, binding herself to the world that they might evade calamity and strife together.*
The Sidereal can transport a landscape or community across Creation, reshaping both reality and the Celestial Bureaucracy’s records to make it as if it had always been there. When she uses this Charm, she chooses a region out to (Essence) miles from her, ensnaring all inhabitants, structures, habitations, natural features, demesnes and manses, and the landscape within her fate. She can’t pick and choose what to bring, nor can she bring something that doesn’t fall entirely within this range. If this includes an unwilling character’s demesne, manse, or similar place of power, the Sidereal must roll (Wits + Dodge) opposed by his (Wits + Occult) to move it. On a failed roll, it remains behind.
As the Sidereal moves, the region moves with her.
She must travel under her own power, rendering this incompatible with mounts, sorcerous travel, and the like. Vehicles are also incompatible, except for mobility aids like wheeled chairs. The region and its inhabitants exist at a remove from reality until they reach their destination; they’re visible and still capable of action, but outsiders can’t interact with them without specialized magic, and vice versa.
The prayer strip slowly tightens around the Sidereal’s waist, inflicting one die of unavoidable bashing damage each hour. Incapacitation from this isn’t fatal but ends the Charm, leaving the transported region wherever she fell.
Once the Sidereal stops moving, the region is integrated into the world around her. It won’t destroy anything that was there originally: bringing a desert into a forest would cause the forest to recede enough to make room; dragging a village on top of another would blend their architecture and landscapes together.
Characters’ memories, maps and other documentation, and Heaven’s records are altered to reflect that the transported region has always been at its destination.
This can be resisted like arcane fate (p. 141). Even destiny is revised, seamlessly accounting for the Sidereal’s changes (though she should expect to pick up her coworkers’ bar tabs for the foreseeable future if she uses this Charm frivolously.) ## Reset
Once per story unless reset by learning of a narratively relevant threat to an entire region.
