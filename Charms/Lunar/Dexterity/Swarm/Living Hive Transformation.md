*Cunning Anglerfish Decoy The Lunar’s flesh twists and writhes, portions of her body transforming into small animals or parts of larger creatures.*
Skin unwinds into serpents; hornets burrow out of her flesh; sharp-fanged maws open across her body. When an enemy successfully attacks her from close range, she can make a decisive counterattack with an unarmed attack or natural weapon. This deals ([[Essence]]) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. It doesn’t include or reset the Lunar’s [[Initiative]]. She adds ([[Essence]]) dice of damage to counterattacks made with [[Coiled Serpent Strikes]] from close range using unarmed attacks or natural weapons. While clinched, counterattacks enhanced with this Charm ignore penalties for being grappled, and the Lunar can respond to her enemy’s restrain, drag, release, or other non-attack grapple actions with counterattacks. If she controls a grapple, she may make one reflexive decisive attack on each of her turns against her victim, which functions identically to this Charm’s counterattacks. 

## Special activation rules

When the Lunar uses [[Deadly Beastman Transformation]] (p. XX), she may reflexively activate this Charm. 
## Totemic 

Lunars with hive-dwelling spirit shapes may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm, with Salamander’s [[Tail]] Feint (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
