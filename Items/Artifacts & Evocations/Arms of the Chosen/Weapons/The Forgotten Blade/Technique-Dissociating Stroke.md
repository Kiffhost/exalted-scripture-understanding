*A warrior’s skills are ingrained in his memory through training and experience, yet memory is merely food for !!theExalt’ssword.Afterthewieldersuccessfullyblocksan!! attack with the Forgotten Blade, she chooses an Instantduration Charm, Evocation, or spell that was used in the attack.*
For the remainder of the scene, the attacker forgets that he ever possessed that Charm, Evocation, or spell and can no longer use it, though it remains valid as a prerequisite. This Evocation can be stacked ([[Essence]]) times. Each time, it applies to a different attacker. [[Technique-Dissociating Stroke]] cannot be used against [[Excellencies]]. It terminates if the wielder is crashed, but using it again this scene against the same target has no [[Willpower]] cost.
