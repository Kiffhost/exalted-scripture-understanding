Senators wear extravagant white silk robes, trimmed with scarlet signifying their devotion to the Empress; many also wear colored sashes to indicate their factional affiliation. Delegates wear gray and scarlet robes. Each of the Deliberative’s officers wears a ceremonial cape, its pattern and colors unique to her position. Failure to wear one’s official garb bars Deliberative members from attendance; wearing shabby robes is a grave insult to both Deliberative and Empress. The expense of maintaining one’s wardrobe is yet another distraction the Empress imposed on potential enemies.
