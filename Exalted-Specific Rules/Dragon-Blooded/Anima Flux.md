## Anima Flux

When a Dragon-Blood’s anima banner rises to the bonfire level, her untamed elemental power spills from it as pure destructive force, called anima flux. At the bonfire level, she rolls one die of withering damage against all non-Dragon-Blooded characters within close range of her (including allies) at the start of each turn. She doesn’t gain [[Initiative]] from her anima flux.

Crashed characters and trivial enemies instead suffer one die of decisive lethal damage. Outside of combat, anima flux inflicts one die of lethal damage each minute. Characters with [[Hardness]] 1+ are unaffected by anima flux.

Anima flux may damage scenery if dramatically appropriate, setting cloth tapestries ablaze or shattering wooden walls with seismic force. For this reason, Dragon-Blooded favor sturdy stone architecture in their homes or other places where their anima banners might flare.
