*The Abyssal speaks the Old Laws anew, asserting spiritual dominion over death itself.*
The Abyssal speaks in an eerie discordance that is not a language but is understood instinctively by the undead and other creatures of darkness. She adds (Essence/2, rounded up) automatic successes on Occult rolls as long as she uses this bleak tongue in her stunt.
However, she can’t comprehend any other languages except when listening to creatures of darkness.
With an Occult 5, Essence 2 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to enhance this Charm. Any roll that receives its bonus dice also rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10, maximum (Essence).
