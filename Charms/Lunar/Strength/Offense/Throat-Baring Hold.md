*The Lunar brings down her prey, letting a fellow hunter deal the final blow.*
She need only expend one round of control over a clinched foe to restrain or drag him (Exalted, p. 201), and doing so inflicts an onslaught penalty. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Pack Hunting, the clinched foeâ€™s onslaught penalty subtracts from his soak and [[Hardness]] until his next turn.
