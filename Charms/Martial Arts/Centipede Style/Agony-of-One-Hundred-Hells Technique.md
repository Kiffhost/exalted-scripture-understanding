*Unleashing Centipede style’s death-strike, the stylist inflicts excruciating pain on a foe, his nerves screaming and his veins blackening with poison.* 
She makes a decisive attack. As long as it deals damage, her victim adds his onslaught to his wound penalty, with a combined maximum of –4, until his onslaught penalty refreshes. If he suffers new onslaught penalties before then, they’ll continue adding to his wound penalty. 
If the victim is poisoned, (higher of onslaught or wound penalty, maximum 5) total intervals of poison discharge through him, rolling damage against him and reducing duration commensurately. If there are multiple poisons, the stylist chooses which ones are discharged. 
If the stylist uses this Charm to make a savaging attack, she can also expend rounds of grapple control to discharge that many additional intervals of poison, maximum 10. 
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that raises a nontrivial enemy’s onslaught penalty to –8 or higher.
