Those who hide in the darkness reveal their own wickedness. The martial artist adds (Occult) bonus dice on an Awareness roll to Join Battle or detect a hidden threat in combat. If any creatures of darkness oppose her roll, (her Essence) total 1s on their rolls add nonCharm dice to her roll. She cannot pinpoint which of her enemies are creatures of darkness with this Charm, but can sense sheâ€™s in the presence of unhale forces. 
## Mastery

If the martial artist wins Join Battle against a creature of darkness and uses her first turn to attack one, she may reflexively move one range band towards it before attacking in addition to her normal movement action, and adds (Occult) dice of post-soak withering damage or one success on a decisive damage roll.
