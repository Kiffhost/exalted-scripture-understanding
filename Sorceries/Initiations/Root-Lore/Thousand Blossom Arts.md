## Thousand Blossom Arts
The sorcerer can spend a few hours foraging in the wilderness to retrieve a puissant plant, a difficulty 2 (Intelligence + Survival) roll. The roll’s difficulty is increased in areas with sparse plant life. Collecting multiple reagents raises the difficulty by 2 but provides an effectively unlimited stock. Once per scene, she may incorporate a reagent into a spell, contributing (highest of Intelligence, Lore, or Survival) sorcerous motes towards it. Reagents retain their power for a week and can only be used by the sorcerer who harvested them.
