The Exaltâ€™s body becomes almost fluid as it disperses the force of attacks. Against a withering attack, (lower of [[Essence]] or [[Stamina]]) 1s on the damage roll subtract successes. Against a decisive attack, (lower of [[Essence]] or [[Stamina]]) 1s force her attacker to reroll that many damage dice that show success, beginning with 7s and moving up.
