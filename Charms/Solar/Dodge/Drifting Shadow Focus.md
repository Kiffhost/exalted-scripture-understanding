Like a shadow moving in the darkness, the Lawgiver drifts through the ranks of her enemies, sowing terror and confusion. This Charm is declared before an attack and lasts until the Exaltâ€™s next turn. Upon a successful dodge, it allows the Solar to redirect an attack made against her to any other target within close range.
