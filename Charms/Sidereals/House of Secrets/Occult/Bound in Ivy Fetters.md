*The Sidereal has become a vessel for a thing forbidden by Heaven’s will, remaking herself in body and soul as a living prison.*
The Sidereal has a great foe of Heaven sealed within her. Time spent training to learn this Charm consists of securing approval from the Division of Secrets and undergoing rituals that purify the Sidereal’s spirit and mark her as a binding vessel for this being. Such training can’t be accelerated or circumvented with magic, though stories tell of rogue Sidereals who’ve instead learned this Charm by forming pacts with otherworldly forces
Once the Sidereal has completed her training, Heaven’s gaolers bind a powerful and malevolent force within her: an ancient forbidden god, powerful demon, or worse. This always leaves a scar, tattoo, or similar marking. The Storyteller doesn’t need to create traits for this being and it can’t be interacted with like a normal character, though the Storyteller can optionally make a list of its Intimacies for roleplaying purposes. 
As the bound entity’s vessel, the Sidereal gains the following benefits. Some of them let the being impose an [[Intimacy]] on the Sidereal, inflicting it at Minor intensity or strengthening an Intimacy by one step. The Storyteller should choose Intimacies that represent the being’s destructive or corrupting influence and challenge the Sidereal’s own goals, desires, and ethical beliefs. This can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]]. 
### Chained Maiden’s Wrath
The Sidereal may reflexively commit five motes and pay one Willpower to merge with the bound entity for a scene, undergoing a transformation that expresses its nature. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Sidereal’s player should design this transformation by choosing 10 dots of mutations as well as ([[Essence]]) Eclipse Charms suitable to the spirit’s nature. While transformed, she gains these mutations and can use the chosen Charms. If she gains one of those traits normally by spending experience, she may select a replacement. Invoking this transformation lets the sealed being impose an Intimacy on the Sidereal. 
### Gaol-Mind Durance
The sealed being’s presence grants the Sidereal +1 [[Resolve]] against [[Charm Keywords#Psyche|Psyche]] effects and +1 [[Guile]] against magic that reads her thoughts or otherwise intrudes on her mind. When she spends Willpower to resist such an effect, she can let the being impose an Intimacy on her in place of paying one Willpower. Once she’s done so in place of three points of Willpower, no further Willpower is needed to resist. If the effect requires her to spend Willpower on multiple occasions, this only counts for that one occasion. 
### Sealed Power Awakening
Once per day, the Sidereal can draw power from the sealed being, reflexively rolling ([[Charisma]] + [[Occult]]). For each success, she gains one mote or can add a sorcerous mote to a spell she’s shaping. She can also exchange five successes for a point of Willpower. Doing so lets the sealed being impose an Intimacy on the Sidereal. 
The bound entity can offer advice and tutelage to the Sidereal, with expertise comparable to that of a three-dot [[Mentor]]. The Sidereal’s player should work with the Storyteller to determine the specifics of its knowledge and expertise. It can always teach her Eclipse Charms appropriate to its nature. If the being’s expertise applies to the Sidereal’s training, she can divide the time necessary by 10 or incur experience debt (p. 169) to gain it. 
So long as the Sidereal lives, the sealed entity can’t escape its imprisonment.
