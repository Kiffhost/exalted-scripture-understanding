*The Sidereal’s feint exposes the weaknesses of an enemy’s defense.*
A successful distract gambit inflicts a penalty equal to the enemy’s soak and [[Hardness]] equal to the [[Initiative]] transferred. This lasts until the end of the gambit beneficiary’s next turn. If this reduction exceeds either his soak or [[Hardness]], he suffers dice of unspeakable withering damage equal to the total difference. This damage awards [[Initiative]] to the gambit’s beneficiary, separate from the gambit’s bonus.
