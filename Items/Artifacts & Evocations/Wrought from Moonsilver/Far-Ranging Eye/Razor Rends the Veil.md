Those who hide behind trickery find themselves unveiled. When the wielder successfully uses SoulPiercing Lens against an enemy employing magical disguise, concealment, or similar sense-deceiving magic, she may roll Initiative at difficulty (that power’s minimum Essence + 2), as per a gambit (Exalted, p. 199). This counts as an unblockable, undodgeable attack. Success ends that effect. If her target benefits from multiple such effects, she chooses which one to target. This Evocation can’t negate shapeshifting, resplendent destinies, or instant or permanent effects. If used against effects that enhance mundane disguises, like Perfect Mirror (Exalted, p. 319), it won’t retroactively negate bonuses to disguise rolls, although it will cancel deception beyond the usual effect of a successful disguise. 

## Resonant

The gambit’s Initiative cost is halved, rounded down.
