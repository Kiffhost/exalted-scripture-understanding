Drawing on her abundant medical expertise, the Dragon-Blood turns disease into another weapon in her arsenal. She strikes at a foe with malaise-bearing [[Essence]], afflicting him with any mundane disease that she’s successfully made a [[Medicine]] roll to treat during the chronicle. This is a difficulty 3 gambit using any combat Ability. Success exposes that enemy to the disease, with every two threshold successes on the Dragon-Blood’s [[Initiative]] roll imposing a −1 penalty on his ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll against its virulence. Trivial foes and crashed enemies acquire the disease at Major intensity on a failed roll. With [[Medicine]] 5, [[Essence]] 5, the Dragon-Blood may add supernatural diseases that she’s treated with a successful [[Medicine]] roll to the repertoire of ailments she can inflict by repurchasing this Charm for each disease. She must pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to do so, and the difficulty of the gambit rises to 5. Incurable or irresistible diseases such as the Great Contagion cannot be transmitted through this Charm.
