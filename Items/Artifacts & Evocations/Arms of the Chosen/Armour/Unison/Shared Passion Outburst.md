*The Exalt’s passions become the armor’s passions.*
[[Unison]] suffuses her strikes with more force and speed when it senses that they hold great import. To use this Evocation, the wearer must be in [[Unison#Quicksilver Host Mien|Quicksilver Host Mien]] or [[Unison#Final Unity Mien|Final Unity Mien]]. She chooses an [[Intimacy]] that represents her reason for fighting, and adds ([[Intimacy]]) to the Overwhelming rating of all her withering attacks for the rest of the scene. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wearer isn’t dissonant with moonsilver, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] while in any of Unity’s miens.
