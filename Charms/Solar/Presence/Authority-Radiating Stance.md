The Lawgiver exudes rightful authority. This Charm prevents every ally within medium range from succumbing completely to fear. As long as they can see the Solar or hear her voice, they suffer no fear-based penalties to their actions. The Exaltâ€™s rally rolls (p. 210) are also enhanced, gaining one automatic success. This Charm does not protect characters from supernatural terror or from being threatened by a [[Dawn]] Caste.
