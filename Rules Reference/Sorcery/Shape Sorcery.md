1. Declare the Spell and spend its [[Willpower]] cost if appropriate.
2. Roll ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]), this counts as a [[Combat Action]], and cannot be [[Flurry|flurried]]. 
	1. Each success contributes 1 [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Motes|sorcerous mote]] to the casting of the spell. ^d9f282
3. If this is sufficient to meet the spell’s cost, it is cast immediately (and reflexively).
	1. If not, the sorcerer must continue focusing [[Essence]] into the spell in subsequent rounds.
	2. Repeat from [[#^d9f282|step 2]], adding sorcerous motes until enough are accumulated to cast the spell.
	3. Upon successful casting, the sorcerer regains 1 point of [[Willpower]] spent to cast the spell, except if they are in [[Initiative#Crash]]. 
A sorcerer can pause in the act of gathering sorcerous motes to perform another #Action, but loses 3 sorcerous motes at the end of every [[Time#Round|round]] where none were gathered. [[#Reflexive rituals]] can help here.

Some spells require an extended period of shaping [[Essence]] to cast, generally on the order of hours or longer. Keeping track of the accumulation of sorcerous motes in these cases is less relevant than the time invested in the spell, and so they are simply noted as having a cost of “Ritual.”
# Rituals
The way in which a sorcerer wields power is called a *shaping ritual*. These may be drawn from a  sorcerous *archetype*, which represent the character's sorcerous background.
## Archetypes
Example archetypes include:
```dataview
LIST
FROM #SorcerousArchetype 
```
Each archetype is associated with a number of *shaping rituals*, which provide instructions and conditions as to how a character might gain [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Motes|sorcerous motes]].
## Reflexive Rituals
If a sorcerer uses a shaping ritual that allows her to reflexively gather sorcerous motes for a turn, this prevents the loss of motes for interrupting a cast.
# Changing Spells
If the sorcerer begins casting a different spell from the one she has started shaping, then her current spell is prematurely aborted, and all gathered sorcerous motes disperse and are lost. If she simply stops gathering motes, she will continue losing three sorcerous motes per round until she has none remaining, at which point the spell is lost.
