*The Abyssal dedicates herself to the hunt, making her more alert, deft, and aggressive.*
The Abyssal chooses an individual to be her quarry. She adds one non-Charm die on rolls to [[Tracking|track]] him, [[rush]] him, or oppose his [[disguise]] or [[Stealth]] rolls for each of the following that’s true:
 - She’s faced her quarry in combat in the current story.
 - Her quarry has a −1 or higher [[Health Track#wound penalties|wound penalty]].
 - She has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] that supports pursuing her quarry.
 - Her quarry has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear that applies to her.
This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if the Abyssal uses it against an enemy after damaging him with a [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack]] or [[Initiative#Crashing|crashing]] him with a [[Attack#withering|withering attack]].
With an [[Archery]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a three-mote surcharge to treat all the living as her quarry. This can’t receive the discount above.
