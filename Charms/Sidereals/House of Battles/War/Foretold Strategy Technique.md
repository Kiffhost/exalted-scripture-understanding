Foreseeing how a strategy might be defeated, the Sidereal chooses an alternative. The Sidereal can use this Charm after a Strategic Maneuver roll to reroll it. It receives the benefits of all magic used to enhance the first roll; the Sidereal can use additional Charms as well. She may change what stratagem she seeks to enact with the reroll.
