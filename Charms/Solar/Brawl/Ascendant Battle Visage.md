Channeling her anima through her physical form, the Lawgiver merges with her iconic manifestation to become a visage of divine wrath. Her hair may lengthen and change colors while her skin darkens toward the spectrums of Solar anima. Her eyes glow white, her voice echoes and thunders, and her body becomes the blazing imprint of tattoos and markings that represent her iconic form, alive and glowing with inner fire. During this time, her anima licks the air as if it were burning, but will neither rise to iconic or fall to dim so long as this Charm’s mote cost is committed. During this time, the Exalt moves with terrific speed. She may rush with double 7s, and may rush with her Strength instead of Dexterity, flying toward her opponent in great leaps. If her opponent is three or more range bands away, she may move two range bands to approach him until she is within medium or short range. During this time, she may clash any attack as her combat action, without having to delay, and if she successfully clashes a ranged attack she immediately flashes into close range with her opponent, clashing, blurring over the distance and striking her target all in the same instant. Furthermore, Ascendant Battle Visage makes the Solar incredibly resilient. For the duration of the Charm, no amount of withering damage can crash her unless it is delivered from close range. If the Solar knows Orichalcum Fists of Battle, she may activate that Charm and its prerequisite reflexively when she assumes this Charm, paying only six motes and ignoring the anima and Willpower cost to do so. In addition, if she knows the Charm Fire-Eating Fist she may store damage from any attack she clashes, with or without Charms. If she knows the Charm Apocalypse Flare Attack, she may unleash that attack at the iconic level without expending her anima or ending this Charm’s effect.
