The Exalt opens her eyes not to the visual world, but to the world of Essence, sensing her target in that fashion. She may make an Archery attack without penalties for visual conditions. Smoke, fog, and pitch darkness are no longer a problem for her, though other factors such as high winds and cover still apply against the attack. At Archery 5+, Essence 3+, the Solar can momentarily see through cover, perceiving her targets as silhouettes the colors of bright anima.
