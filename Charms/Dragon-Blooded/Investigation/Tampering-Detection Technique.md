*Even the slightest disturbance at the scene of a crime can have consequences that ripple throughout an entire investigation.*
Success on a [[Case Scene]] roll reveals whether any attempt has been made to [[Conceal Evidence]] (Exalted, p. 224), although not the identity of the character responsible. Alternatively, this Charm can be used when the Dragon-Blood examines an item for signs of tampering. She can automatically tell if any character has used [[Larceny]] to interfere with that object in the last ([[Essence]] + [[Investigation]]) hours — picking a lock, forging credentials, hiding contraband inside a barrel, and so on. This reveals the nature of the tampering, but not the perpetrator’s identity or the time it occurred. With [[Investigation]] 4, [[Essence]] 3, the Dragon-Blooded can detect tampering that has occurred in the last ([[Essence]] + [[Investigation]]) days.
