*The Abyssal pours the allure of immortality into her work, encouraging the weak-willed to fight to possess it.*
The Abyssal makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Craft instill roll against a single target as she displays something she’s crafted with at least a major project. If successful, her target gains a Minor Obsession (Exalted, p. 169) with acquiring it. If he had a Major or Defining Tie that supported the Abyssal’s influence, his Obsession is Major instead.
Until the Abyssal’s target obtains the object, he can’t regain Willpower from resting, his dreams poisoned by avarice. If he succeeds in obtaining it, he can’t give it up. Whenever he makes a read intentions roll, he must make a Willpower roll against his Obsession if he hasn’t already done so that day. If he fails the Willpower roll, he fails the read intentions roll automatically and believes his target seeks to obtain the Abyssal’s creation.
Each time a character succeeds on a Willpower roll against his Obsession, its hold on him is weakened, letting him regain Willpower from sleep that night. Once he’s done so (Abyssal’s Essence) times, he loses the Obsession and is freed from this influence. However, once a character obtains the Abyssal’s work, he can only resist by abandoning it, requiring him to enter a Decision Point and cite a Major or Defining Intimacy to pay three Willpower. Even magic capable of breaking Psyche effects is ineffective.
If he dies, he always returns as a ghost if able, still subject to this Charm’s influence and incapable of resisting it. The ghost remains obsessed with protecting the object and his hungry ghost stalks and attacks anyone who possesses the object.
## Reset
This Charm can’t be used against a character more than once per story.
