Such is the martial artist’s speed that she is not seen to move as she strikes aside fatal blows. After an attack beats the stylist’s Defense, but before the damage roll, she can use this Charm to make a decisive counterattack. If she deals damage, her attacker’s damage roll suffers a penalty of (her attack roll extra successes + damage roll 10s). If she incapacitates him, she gains one Willpower and is treated as if she’d successfully blocked the attack. This Charm can only be used once per scene unless reset by crashing an enemy who’s suffering wound penalties.
