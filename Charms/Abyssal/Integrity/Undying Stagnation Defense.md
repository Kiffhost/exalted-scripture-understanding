*The Abyssal permeates her being with death’s stasis, passing unchanged through the courts of chaos.*
The Abyssal and her equipment are immune to the effects of exposure to the Wyld and other environment Shaping effects that would alter her body, mind, or equipment.
She instinctively senses such perils in time to use this Charm and can use it even while asleep or incapacitated.
