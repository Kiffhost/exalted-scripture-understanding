*Noise ever fills the Demon City, as silence is danger. Though almost all this sound is meaningless, its passage through Hell’s strange environs and the homes of mighty demons infuse it with echoes of strange power. Those who endure the pain and danger of exposure to an onslaught of the loudest clangour may catch a whisper of a mystical secret. At first, it takes the form of an inconstant tinnitus, but persistent practice amplifies the reverberation to a litany of ancient chants and forgotten names. A loose college of cacophonists exists, meeting in the midst of Hell’s loudest parades and communicating through mystical means or secret signs. Though this practice is largely unknown outside Hell, an ancient wail that once escaped into Creation is now bound in a secret prison, where it continues unabated for the study of its captors.*
