*The Lunar walks the boundaries between human and beast, at one with both worlds.*
Animals feel an instinctive loyalty toward her, equivalent to a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]]. Her social influence doesn’t suffer penalties for targeting multiple animals, and they don’t gain [[Resolve]] bonuses for lacking a shared language. This doesn’t affect familiars and other magically enhanced animals. With [[Wits]] 3, the Lunar may spend one [[Willpower]] while in an animal shape. For that scene, animals of the same species are treated as having a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty toward her, unless they are nontrivial and have reason to defy her, e.g., hunger, rabies, or a spirit’s influence.
