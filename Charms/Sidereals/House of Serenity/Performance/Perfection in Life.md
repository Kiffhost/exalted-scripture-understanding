The Sidereal sketches out the pattern of what someoneâ€™s perfect life could be, inspiring their every word and action with a glimpse of a better life. After at least a minute spent observing or interacting with someone, the Sidereal transfers up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) [[Willpower]] to him. With a [[Performance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can transfer [[Willpower]] instantly.
