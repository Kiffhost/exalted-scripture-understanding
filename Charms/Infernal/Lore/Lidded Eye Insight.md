*The Infernal sleeps fitfully, bearing witness to secret horrors and forbidden truths.*

The Infernal can spend a scene in deep sleep to introduce a fact without needing a Lore background, adding a free full Excellency. If she has a Defining Intimacy of fear related to the topic, she succeeds automatically, but can’t voluntarily weaken that Intimacy for the rest of the story. If she has an applicable Lore background, she only needs a Major Intimacy for this.
