By disguising her ship’s sail, rigging style, ornamentation, and crew uniform, the Solar may use this Charm to complete the illusion. After a process of disguising the ship that takes one hour, this Charm completes the disguise, making it look like a vessel of slightly smaller or slightly larger build, going so far as to change the hull’s construction so that it appears as a completely different type of boat, and giving it the telltale ornamentation, flag, and name appropriate to the style of vessel the Solar intends. As long as the ship is not behaving suspiciously, the disguise is perfect, allowing a pirate vessel to slip into a harbor disguised as a coastal merchant. This effect becomes uncertain when suspicious characters come within three range bands of the ship. Such characters can attempt to pierce this Charm by rolling Perception + Sail or Perception + Lore against the Lawgiver’s Manipulation + Sail. If successful, the suspicious character sees some flaw that collapses the whole illusion. What constitutes “suspicious behavior” is up to the dramatic whim of the Storyteller.
