*He who denies, attacks; she who knows, invites.*
After parrying an attack made by an enemy whose secrets she knows, the wielder makes a withering or decisive counterattack. The attack roll gains a bonus success for a serious secret, or two successes for a life-changing secret. 

## Resonant

The wielder may reflexively make an influence roll in place of a counterattack, leveraging one of the attackerâ€™s secrets against him. She steals a point of [[Initiative]] from him for each threshold success, maximum ([[Manipulation]]).
