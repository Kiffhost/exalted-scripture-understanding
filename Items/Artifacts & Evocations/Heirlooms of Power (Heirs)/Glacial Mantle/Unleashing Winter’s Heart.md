*Slamming a mailed fist into the ground, Glacial Mantle’s master unleashes a wave of freezing [[Essence]] to sculpt the battlefield to her will.*
She rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[War]]) to freeze the battlefield with one of the following effects, at the listed difficulty.
 - Ice Platform (Difficulty 1): The wearer freezes the surface of a body of water to create a platform of ice within close range that’s capable of bearing her weight.
 - Ice Slick (Difficulty 3): The wearer rimes over a surface within close range of her, creating a patch of difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) large enough to encompass a single character. If she uses this Evocation to create an ice slick directly beneath an enemy, the roll’s difficulty is (higher of his [[Defense|Evasion]] or 3).
 - Ramp/Bridge (Difficulty 4): The wearer creates a bridge or ramp of ice within close range, providing unobstructed passage over pits, difficult terrain, and the like. The bridge or ramp is only a single range band long. There must be a significant source of water she can draw from to create it, such as a barrel or stream. An enemy can destroy it with a difficulty 4 gambit against its [[Defense|Parry]] of (higher of wearer’s [[Essence]] or 3). The gambit’s difficulty is reduced to 2 if performed with a fire-based attack.
 - Wall (Difficulty 4): The wearer creates a barrier of ice within close range, capable of providing light cover (Exalted, p. 198-199). If there is a significant source of water, such as a barrel or stream, this provides heavy cover instead. An enemy can destroy this barrier with a difficulty 4 gambit against its [[Defense|Parry]] of (higher of wearer’s [[Essence]] or 3). The gambit’s difficulty is reduced to 2 if performed with a fire-based attack.
If the wearer is fighting under a stratagem enacted with [[Winter Brings Death]], she adds an automatic success on rolls to use this Evocation, and her ice constructs can’t be destroyed with gambits.
