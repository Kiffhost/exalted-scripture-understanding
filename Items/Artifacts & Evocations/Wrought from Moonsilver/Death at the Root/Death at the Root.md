A master Lunar geomancer and artificer of the First Age, Shu Ri-Li the Dragon Line Shepherd wielded his Crook of Earthly Harmony to raise chatoyant towers that ascended into Yu-Shan, sacred pagodas that sealed shadowlands, and jungles of living gemstone. But when the Usurpation’s aftermath delivered his life’s work into the hands of the traitorous Dragon-Blooded, he snapped his green jade rod and reforged it with a heavy moonsilver blade. With the newly christened Death at the Root, he denied the usurpers their stolen manses, maiming dragon lines and destroying irreplaceable First Age geomantic and sorcerous infrastructure. A weapon of immense power well-suited to the Silver Pact’s purposes, Death at the Root has been held by many Lunars throughout time. Seventh-Born Moth used it to destroy the Mirror-Eye Ziggurat, blinding the Realm to her Circle’s liberation of Kinerack. Black Heavens Magister turned it against the Four Winds Throne at Greyfalls, laying low the almighty Realm Defense Grid for a season, though the ensuing Wyld Hunt killed him and captured the grimcleaver. It would not remain long in Dragon-Blooded hands; Hajkal Pra stole it from Ledaal Purun’s sanctum-manse and sundered the wards worked into its walls as an afterthought. It frequently trades hands within the Pact as a repayment for favors between shahan-yas and their schools.

Upon attuning to Death at the Root, its wielder awakens Sever the Flow for free. The grimcleaver can destroy hearthstones without needing the normal prerequisites and period of examination (Exalted, p. 604).
