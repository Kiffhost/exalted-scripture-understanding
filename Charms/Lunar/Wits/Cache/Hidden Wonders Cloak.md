*The Lunar hides treasures in places that aren’t there.*
She can use [[Many-Pockets Meditation]] to conceal items in spaces that would normally be unable to contain them, instead of Elsewhere — an innocuous bag, jaunty hat, voluminous coat, etc. She can designate characters who can detect and retrieve the concealed object. Others can’t perceive it, although characters using magic like [[All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight]] (Exalted, p. 356) can see and retrieve it. If the container is destroyed, the stored object vanishes Elsewhere, per [[Many-Pockets Meditation]]’s default effect. 
The Lunar may normally conceal ([[Wits]] x2) objects in one container. If using [[Many-Pockets Meditation]]’s repurchase to conceal larger objects, she’s limited to one per container.
