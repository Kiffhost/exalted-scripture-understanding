*The Abyssal drifts through the air with eerie weightlessness.*
The Abyssal can make a horizontal leap without needing anything to kick off against, , and can end her movement in midair. On her next turn, she must use this Charm again to continue the leap or fall to the ground. In addition to any horizontal motion, she descends one range band for each consecutive use of this Charm past the first, though a stunt can circumvent this. Leaps that span multiple range bands require a running start.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can avoid all damage from a fall. For falls greater than two range bands, she must pay a three-mote surcharge, plus another three motes for every three range bands beyond the third.
With an [[Athletics]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a two-mote surcharge to use this Charm without jumping, gliding eerily across the ground. She doesnâ€™t lose elevation while gliding through midair and can cross multiple range bands without needing a running start.
