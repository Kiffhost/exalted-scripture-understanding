*Such is the martial artist’s speed that she is not seen to move as she strikes aside fatal blows.*
After an attack beats the stylist’s Defense, but before the damage roll, she can use this Charm to make a decisive counterattack. If she deals damage, her attacker’s damage roll suffers a penalty of (her attack roll extra successes + attacker’s wound penalty). If she incapacitates him, she gains one Willpower and is treated as if she’d successfully blocked the attack.
### Terrestrial
The damage roll penalty can’t exceed −5.
This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round, or for the next round if she’s already attacked.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by crashing an enemy who’s suffering wound penalties.
