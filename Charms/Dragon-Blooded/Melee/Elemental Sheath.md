*The Dragon-Blood consigns an artifact [[Melee]] weapon to the elements, banishing it Elsewhere through a dramatic and significant manifestation of an element that is at least as large as her weapon.*
Her daiklave might become translucent and fluid as she touches it to the surface of a lake, dissolving into the body of water; a [[Templates/direlance]] plunged into a boulder or stone wall might vanish into it; a [[Goremaul]] fades away as a strong gust of wind carries it away. She may alternatively recall it from a similar manifestation of the same element. If the Exalt doesn’t have access to an appropriate elemental manifestation, she may expend a level of anima to banish or recall her weapon. Once banished this way, it may be recalled through a manifestation of her Aspect element.
