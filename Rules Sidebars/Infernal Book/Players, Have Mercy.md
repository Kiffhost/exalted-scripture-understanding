[[Unity of the Closed Fist]] is a powerful tool brimming with dramatic potential. It also asks a lot of both the players and the Storyteller. We strongly recommend that players create the traits for their Amalgam long before casting the spell.

By default, the Amalgam is limited to five participants, but this should be adjusted if there’s a higher or lower number of player characters. We recommend against mixing player characters and Storyteller characters as part of the same Amalgam; the intention is to give players the opportunity to shine cooperatively, rather than picking the optimum fifth participant. Likewise, a Circle is intended to have only one Amalgam, rather than many theoretical permutations of two-, three-, or four-character combinations.

These guidelines are meant to help maintain the spirit of the spell as a wondrous miracle of cooperation. Feel free to diverge from them to better suit the wants, needs, and preferences of your group as a whole.
