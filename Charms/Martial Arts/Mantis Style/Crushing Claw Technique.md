*The mantis catches its prey with deadly speed.*
The martial artist adds one automatic success on the attack roll of a grapple gambit or a decisive attack. If she lands a grapple, she rolls ([Strength or Dexterity] + [[Martial Arts]]) with (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) bonus dice to establish control over it. If she lands a decisive attack, ([[Essence]]) 10s on her attack roll add dice of damage.
