Many [[Socialize]] [[Charms]] describe functioning to change policy, or having an effect on a character’s standing in a particular culture. These [[Charms]] apply equally to small groups such as “The local fishermen,” “Members of the [[Guild]] hall,” “The Nimble Raiton Company,” and so on. Keep in mind that small groups have their own distinct cultures and rituals and that these terms do not refer exclusively to the politics and mores of nations. [[Charms]] such as [[Understanding the Court]] work equally well in a tea shop where peasants congregate as they do in the palace of Chiaroscuro’s Tri-Khan.
