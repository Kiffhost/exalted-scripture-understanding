*Cloaked in nothingness, the Abyssal dances through all that would harm her.*
The Abyssal perfectly dodges an attack or other source of harm, even if it’s undodgeable. This doesn’t let her defend against ambushes. Uncountable damage is negated completely; she becomes immune to a recurring source of uncountable damage.
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless the Abyssal successfully dodges three decisive attacks using [[Incomparable Phantom Form]].
