*Searching for ripples of pain within the fate’s weave, the Sidereal traces them back to the wound that caused them.*
The Sidereal makes a (Perception + Awareness) roll to bear witness to something that took place in the past at her current location. She subtracts one success for each day that’s passed since the event.
If successful, the Sidereal gleans much of what happened from fate’s weave: the number of people present, their movements, and their emotional states. She identifies all characters present that she knows and gets a general description of them. This doesn’t reveal any visual or auditory details, like an unknown character’s exact appearance, though this can be circumvented with an appropriate stunt.
Certain conditions increase the time interval used in determining the roll’s penalty. Each applicable condition increases it by one step: from days, to weeks, to months, to seasons, to years.
- Someone was injured, betrayed, or otherwise harmed in the event.
- Someone was killed in the event.
- An enemy of fate was present at the event, or the event otherwise involved a disruption to destiny.
- The Sidereal has Essence 5+.
