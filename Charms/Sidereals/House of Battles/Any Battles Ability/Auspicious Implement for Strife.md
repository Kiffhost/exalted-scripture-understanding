The weak cling to their weapons; the Sidereal recognizes the potential for violence in every stone, dinner utensil, and piece of furniture. The Sidereal reflexively readies an improvised weapon. She waives the Initiative cost for attacking with it. Withering attacks with it add (higher of Essence or 3) raw damage; decisive attacks double 10s on the damage roll. An Any Battles Ability 3, Essence 2 repurchase lets the Sidereal pay a two-mote, one Willpower surcharge to grant the weapon artifact traits. It can then be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation that can be used with improvised weapons. These Evocations draw their themes and function from the Siderealâ€™s personality, Caste, and birth and Exaltation signs.
