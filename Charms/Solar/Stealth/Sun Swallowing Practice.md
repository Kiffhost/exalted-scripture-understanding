Taking a single short breath, the Solar drinks in her anima to restore the shadows. This Charm costs two motes per anima level the Exalt wishes to consume. Releasing this Charm causes the Solarâ€™s anima to leap into view. At Essence 5+, if the Solar has swallowed four or more levels of anima, she can release her commitment to this Charm by spitting her hidden anima into the air, creating a massive heatless flare that can be seen up to ten miles away. This method of release sheds her anima completely, and inflicts a (number of anima levels expelled + 3) penalty to the Awareness rolls of all characters within long range of the Solar until the next round. A Solar using Eye of the Unconquered Sun is immune to this effect.
