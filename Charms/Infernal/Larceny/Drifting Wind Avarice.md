*The Infernal has never stolen anything. She simply receives the tribute owed to her by the world.*

The Infernal rolls ({Dexterity, Manipulation, or Wits} + Larceny) to steal an object within short range. She need not be aware of it — her player can use this Charm without any conscious action on her part. If successful, the object dissolves into wind and drifts to her hand before reforming, passing through even the slightest of openings.

Alternatively, the Infernal can use this roll as a disarm gambit to steal a weapon within short range. Against mortals and trivial enemies, she can do so even if she isn’t aware of them.
## [[Keys]]
#### Unexpected Bounty Breeze (+1wp)
The Infernal can use this Charm to make a disarm gambit against enemies of any kind without needing to be aware of them.
#### Borrowed Blade Zephyr (Essence 3) (+3m or 3m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote surcharge to use this Charm reflexively on her turn. It doesn’t use her attack, but she can only do so once per turn. Alternatively, she can pay a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to clash an attack with it. If she uses this together with [[#Unexpected Bounty Breeze (+1wp)|Unexpected Bounty Breeze]], she can clash an ambush.
#### Treasure-Seizing Tempest (Larceny 5, Essence 3)
If the Infernal steals an attuned artifact from a character, his attunement to it is broken. The Infernal gains up to (higher of Essence or 3) motes that were committed to the artifact and can reflexively attune to it.
