The Solar is as relentless as the coming storm. This Charm supplements a withering or decisive attack, preventing the onslaught penalty to her target’s [[Defense]] from fading on his next turn. The Solar’s onslaught can only be abated by escaping her long enough to suffer no attack for at least one round. If the Solar is unable or unwilling to attack her target, the effect ends and the target’s [[Defense]] refreshes as normal. [[Falling Hammer Strike]] does not maintain onslaught penalties from other characters’ attacks, nor does it supplement grapple attacks.
