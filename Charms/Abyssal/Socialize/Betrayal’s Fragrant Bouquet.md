*The Abyssal knows well the stench of treachery and deceit.*
The deathknight makes a special read intentions roll. Success lets her player ask the [[Storyteller]] one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes.
 - Does he intend to deceive or betray me?  - Does he think I intend to deceive or betray him?  - Has he betrayed someone who trusts him in the past?  - Who here does he most distrust? If the [[Storyteller]] doesn’t have an answer in mind, the Abyssal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
