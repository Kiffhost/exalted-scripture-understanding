The Solar burns with Essence, launching a captive at a group of foes. When the Solar hurls her captive at a group of foes, the damage roll is enhanced by 4 dice per round of control forfeited by the throw, as described on page 201. The Solar throws her opponent at a target within short range; her captive goes from her like a meteor, blasting through her target and every opponent within short range of him, applying a single Dexterity + Brawl withering attack with a base damage of seven to all additional opponents. Foes struck by this explosive impact are knocked to the ground, and the damage of the throw is applied to each of them separately. If the Solar is crashed when she uses this attack, she still damages each foe, but she only gains Initiative from a single target. When used in combination with Crashing Wave Throw, not only is the damage of this throw enhanced, but also its range, allowing the Solar to strike enemies out to medium range without spending rounds of control per the rules of Crashing Wave Throw. 

## Special activation rules

Shockwave Technique can be used once per combat. In order to reset it, the Solar must deal 10+ health levels of damage on a single decisive Brawl attack.
