The Sidereal maneuvers around possibilities that would give her enemy a clear shot, forcing him to contend with a less favorable reality. An attack against the Sidereal’s Evasion suffers +1 target number. Dodging grants her one Initiative for each die that isn’t a success because of target number reduction, maximum (Essence). With a Dodge 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to inflict +2 target number. Her enemy loses any Initiative she gains with this Charm.
