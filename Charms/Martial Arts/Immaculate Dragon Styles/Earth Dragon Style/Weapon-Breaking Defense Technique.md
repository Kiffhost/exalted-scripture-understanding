The fool who proclaims he’ll slay the mountain can only blame himself when he returns home with a broken sword. The Immaculate reflexively clashes an attack from close range with a disarm gambit that benefits from Shattering Fist Strike. This doesn’t count as her combat action for the round. Winning the clash adds her attack roll threshold successes to the gambit’s Initiative roll. This Charm can’t clash unarmed attacks or other attacks that have the Natural tag. In Earth Aura, the Immaculate may clash to fracture artifact weapons without expending her Aura. This Charm may only be used once per scene, unless reset by dealing 7+ levels of damage to a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack.
