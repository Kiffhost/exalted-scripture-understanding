*The Infernal rewards her faithful steed with a delicious treat.*

The Infernal’s mount makes a grapple gambit with its fangs or maw. If it has a bite attack, it can use that attack’s dice pool instead of its normal grapple attack and control pools. It doubles 9s on the gambit’s Initiative roll and control roll and waives the gambit’s Initiative cost.

On a successful grapple, the mount catches its victim in its jaws. It doesn’t suffer any of the usual penalties for grappling and doesn’t lose rounds of control if the grappled enemy attacks it. (It still loses rounds of control if damaged.) The mount continues to gnaw on its prey, dealing three dice of decisive damage to him at the start of each of its turns, ignoring Hardness, in addition to its grapple action. However, it can’t make bite attacks against other enemies (unless it has another mouth).

If the mount incapacitates a nontrivial enemy that it’s capable of eating, it heals one level of non-aggravated damage. This doesn’t apply to trivial enemies.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she uses [[Blossoming Maw Monstrosity]].
## [[Keys]]
#### Carrion Fodder Regimen (Essence 3)
The Infernal’s mount heals one level of non-aggravated damage upon a successful grapple gambit against a nontrivial enemy that it’s capable of eating, and heals another level each time that enemy takes damage from this Charm. The healing for incapacitating an enemy increases to (enemy’s Essence/2, rounded up) levels.
#### Horrifying Gullet Prison (Essence 4, [[#Carrion Fodder Regimen (Essence 3)|Carrion Fodder Regimen]]) (+3i, 1wp)
The Infernal may pay a three-Initiative, one-Willpower surcharge to have her mount fully swallow a grappled enemy. Its body can distort grotesquely to accommodate oversized prey; horses and similarly-sized mounts can swallow nearly any enemy that lacks Legendary Size. The mount can’t take the usual grapple actions, other than by releasing him, but adds (Infernal’s Essence) to the damage he suffers each turn. The devoured enemy can’t attack anyone but the mount and may suffer other restrictions at the Storyteller’s discretion.
