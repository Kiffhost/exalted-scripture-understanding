The Exalt’s arrows are drawn to those who are drawn to her. When supplementing an attack against an opponent who has an emotional Intimacy or Derangement toward her, or who has focused an inflamed passion (Exalted, p. 218) or other strong emotion on her, the Exalt adds that Intimacy or Derangement’s rating to her attack and damagerolls,treatinganinflamedpassionasaMajorIntimacy. When used with Hunter’s Swift Answer (Exalted, p. 258), this Evocation’s mote cost is waived.
