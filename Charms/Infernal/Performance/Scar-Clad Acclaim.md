*The Infernal’s lament is for her suffering alone. All others are forbidden even from bleeding lest their petty agonies upstage her.*

When a character who can hear or see the Infernal performing suffers decisive damage, she can use this Charm to take up to (1 + her wound penalty, maximum 5) levels of that damage herself, paying one mote and one Initiative per level. His flesh may be cut, but the wounds are hers alone. She ignores wound penalties on Performance rolls and any Appearance-based rolls for the rest of the scene.

If the Infernal’s ally takes no damage after this, he gains the Initiative she spent on this Charm and forms a Minor Intimacy based on his understanding of (or speculation about) the Infernal’s suffering.
