*Reveling in bestial supremacy, the Lunar lays low her prey.*
She adds (1 + attack roll 10s) dice to the post-soak damage of a withering attack, maximum ([[Strength]]), or the damage of a decisive attack, maximum (lower of [[Essence]] or [[Strength]]) dice. Against crashed foes, she counts 9s as well as 10s.
