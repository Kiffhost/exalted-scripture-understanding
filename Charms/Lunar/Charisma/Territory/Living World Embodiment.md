*The Lunar is an avatar of her sacred lands.*
Her wounds are the land’s wounds; her vigor renews the world. Each territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]] gains a virtual health track of seven health levels: one −0, two −1s, two −2s, one −4, and one Incapacitated level. When the Lunar suffers decisive damage within a territory, she may divert up to half that damage, rounded down, into that territory’s health track. Alternatively, she may negate a botch or loss of [[Willpower]] from a disease while in a territory at the cost of one level of damage to it. Damage to the Lunar’s territory manifests as withered plants, barren soil, disease-ridden animals, etc. The territory’s wound penalty is imposed on [[Survival]] rolls to forage or find shelter within it, and [[Craft]] rolls to create objects from its natural resources. The territory heals one level of damage each month. If it’s enhanced by [[Moon-and-Earth Blessing]], it heals one level of damage each week, but Moon-and-Earth Blessing’s bonus successes don’t apply while the territory’s −1 levels or deeper are damaged. While in a territory, the Lunar may forgo healing one level of damage in her own health track to heal a level in the territory’s health track. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this can also undo blights, infestations, or curses upon the land. If a territory’s health track is completely undamaged and it’s enhanced by [[Moon-and-Earth Blessing]], the Lunar may forgo healing levels of damage in her health track to increase Moon-and-Earth Blessing’s bonus to four automatic successes for a number of weeks equal to the levels of healing she forgoes. During this time, her territory evinces supernatural fertility, with plants growing to many times their usual size and animals exhibiting incredible vitality.
