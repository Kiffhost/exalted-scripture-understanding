*The Abyssal may seize knowledge and power from the fragments of a destroyed spirit.*
When the Abyssal lethally incapacitates a spirit with God-Slaying Torment, she can absorb its Essence instead of destroying it. She temporarily gains up to (Essence) of the spirit’s Eclipse Charms for three motes each, as long as she meets their Essence minimums. She can also gain up to (Essence x3) dots of mutations based on the spirit’s appearance and power, committing one mote per dot.
The Abyssal can incur experience debt (p. XX) to permanently gain these Charms or mutations. She waives the experience cost of the first Charm she learns.
