*Holding her ground with ferocious tenacity, the Lunar blockades her foesâ€™ advance.*
She rolls ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]), which counts as her move action. Until her next turn, enemies attempting to move into close range with her with reflexive move actions must roll ({Strength or Dexterity} + [[Athletics]]) opposing her result as a miscellaneous action, which counts as their move action. Those who succeed can enter close range; those who fail are rebuffed by her forceful defense.
