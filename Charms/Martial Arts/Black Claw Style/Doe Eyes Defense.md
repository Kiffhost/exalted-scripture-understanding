Understanding that vulnerability is her greatest defense, the Black Claw stylist exploits it ruthlessly, falling back in exaggerated response to an attack. Every movement accentuates her inferiority in the face of the oncoming assault, unnerving or unduly exciting her aggressor depending on his temperament. Doe Eyes Defense imposes a penalty equal to the martial artist’s Guile on an attack against her. Enemies who have a positive Tie towards her add its intensity to the penalty they suffer. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood uses the lower of her Essence or Guile when calculating the penalty inflicted by this Charm. 

## Mastery

Successfully defending against an attack with this Charm grants the martial artist (1 + the enemy’s Intimacy) Initiative.
