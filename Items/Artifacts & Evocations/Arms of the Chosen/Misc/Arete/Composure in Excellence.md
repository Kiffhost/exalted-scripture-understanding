*What greater source of conviction can one have than one’s own excellence? Whenever a roll supplemented by [[Mudra of Perfected Skill]] achieves 10+ threshold successes, the Exalt gains one temporary [[Willpower]].*
This can exceed her permanent rating. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the Exalt isn’t dissonant with orichalcum, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she rolls 10+ threshold successes on a roll enhanced by [[Mudra of Perfected Skill]]. 

## Resonant

Once per day, the Exalt may trigger this Evocation to gain [[Willpower]] with only (10 − [[Essence]]) threshold successes.
