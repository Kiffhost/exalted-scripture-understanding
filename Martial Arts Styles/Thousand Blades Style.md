# Thousand Blades Style
Thousand Blades is an ancient battle-art of the First Age, an esoteric style that can only be practiced with artifact weapons. Its signature technique lets a stylist wield these weapons with Essence alone, letting them float at her side until she wills them to strike. It can be practiced with only a single daiklave, but unlocking the style’s true potential requires mastering many weapons. Students hone their mastery of Essence through meditation and breathing exercises. They perform the style’s ancient rites and undergo tests of will and endurance to heighten their rapport with the weapons in their arsenal. Few in the Second Age still practice this style, but it’s not been forgotten. Prominent modern-day masters include Sublime Danger, elder of the Silver Pact; Cathak Tatsuzo, a blood-drenched renegade Dawn Caste spearmaster; and the Silver Prince, the Deathlord who rules the Skullstone Archipelago. 
## Special
Learning this style doesn’t require the Martial Artist Merit, as it has no foundation of mundane techniques.
## Weapons
Unlike other styles, Thousand Blades doesn’t have style weapons. Instead, upon learning this style, the martial artist chooses a single type of close-range artifact weapon as their signature weapon. Daiklaves and other bladed weapons are the most common signature weapons, but some stylists employ the likes of goremauls, direlances, or razor parasols. 
## Armour
Thousand Blades Style is compatible with medium armor.
# Arsenal 
Many of this style’s Charms make use of the martial artist’s Arsenal — the number of signature weapons they wield with Thousand Blades Unsheathed. Arsenal can’t exceed 5, even if the stylist has more weapons.
