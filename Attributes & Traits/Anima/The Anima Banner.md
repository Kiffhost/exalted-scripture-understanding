As an Exalt taps into the Essence at her command, her soul ignites, revealing her nature to the world. All of the Chosen possess an anima banner: an invisible, intangible aura that flares to vibrant life when exposed to their unleashed glory. Gods and other natural Essence-users lack anima displays, but the Exalted are neither wholly mortal nor entirely divine; extreme expenditures of Essence eventually stoke their souls into brilliant visibility. As the display builds in power, it might reveal an Exalt to everyone in the room, then everyone in the building, and finally everyone in the city! At its most intense, an Exalt’s anima banner becomes a blazing icon, an immense, coruscating image visible for miles.

# Solar

Your character’s anima is a reflection of who she is, incorporating colors, sounds, and imagery suited to her temperament, ideals, and Caste. The anima of a Zenith priest-king might blaze like the noonday sun, a molten-gold light that burns away all shadows. As he spends Essence, the light takes shape, surrounding him with the image of a sacred mandala inscribed with the vows he’s sworn to the Unconquered Sun and his people. As he makes pronouncements, phantasmal offering-smoke rises to Heaven, and soft voices sing hymns of praise. The anima of a Night Caste assassin might shroud her in a flickering glow like torchlight, casting dancing shadows every which way. As the display intensifies, the shadows grow longer, turning into cloaked, blade-wielding silhouettes that mirror her every move like puppets in a shadow-play. 

**When your character spends five or more motes of Peripheral Essence in an instant, her anima ignites and intensifies by one level for every five Peripheral motes spent.** Personal motes don’t agitate the anima, nor do smaller expenditures of Peripheral. Some Charms may only be used at specific anima levels, while others can mute, diminish, or extinguish the display entirely. 

## Anima Levels 

| Anima Level | Effects |
| ---- | ---- |
| Dim | The Solar’s anima is invisible to all senses, masking her Exalted nature. This is the default level at which a Solar’s anima resides when not spending Essence. |
| Glowing | The character’s anima glows and pulses, outlining him with the colors of the sun. His Caste mark appears on his brow, shining through anything placed over it. Any attempts at stealth or disguise suffer a -3 penalty. |
| Burning | The character’s anima blazes brightly, subsuming his Caste mark into its radi- ance, though the mark may reappear when he uses powerful Charms. Wisps of bright power coil off his body and rise into the air. Anything subjected to his anima may become warm to the touch afterwards, or take on the faint scent of a summer afternoon. Stealth becomes impossible. |
| Bonfire/Iconic | The Solar’s anima ignites in a grand display Iconic of iconic splendor, depicting personal iconography chosen by the player—one Solar warrior’s anima may depict a tiger whose roar shakes the heavens, while a savant may be surrounded by a storm of whirling parchment covered in the lore of bygone ages. This phantasmal display then collapses into a raging bonfire of spiritual power stretching high into the air, visible for miles. This level of display illuminates the area around the Solar out to short range, banishing shadows. His Caste Mark behaves as in the previous progression, and the iconic display may also reappear at dramatic moments. |

It takes about an hour for the anima to vanish from its full brilliance—fifteen minutes to recede from bonfire to burning, the same length to go from burning to glowing, and then about half an hour until the glowing anima dims and vanishes. 

## Anima Effects 

A character’s anima is her most instinctive expression of Essence, granting access to a number of small miracles. A few of these are available to all Solars, while most are unique to a Caste. Where anima effects enhance a dice pool, they do not count as dice added by a Charm (p. 251-252). By feeding a mote of Essence into their anima, all Solars can evoke the following effects: 
- The Solar may feel the brilliant presence of the sun relative to herself and know the exact time of day thereby. This works even if she’s underground or in the Wyld beyond Creation.
- The Solar may cause her Caste Mark to appear and display itself for as long as she desires. 

In addition to these universal effects, Solars of each Caste enjoy a number of innate benefits (ctrl + hover to preview):

# Dragon-Blooded

The anima banners of the Dragon-Blooded manifest their elemental puissance as they expend Essence. **For every five motes of Peripheral Essence a Dragon-Blood spends in an instant, her anima banner rises by one level.** 
## Anima Levels
| Anima Level | Effects |
| ---- | ---- |
| Dim | The Dragon-Blood’s anima is invisible to all senses. This is the default level at which it resides when she’s not spending Essence. |
| Glowing | The Dragon-Blood’s anima outlines her body in the glowing colors of her element, and her aspect markings become more pronounced. Any attempts at stealth or disguise suffer a −3 penalty. |
| Burning | The Dragon-Blood’s anima burns brightly in an aura around her. Stealth becomes impossible.  |
| Bonfire/Iconic | The Dragon-Blood’s anima erupts into a shining pillar of elemental force that stretches high into the sky, visible for miles around. Upon reaching this level, and at suitably dramatic moments, her anima manifests an iconic display of elemental power or other personal symbolism chosen by her player, such as an erupting volcano or a snow leopard carved from ice. The area out to short range of the Dragon-Blood is completely illuminated. Stealth is impossible. |
It takes fifteen minutes for the Dragon-Blood’s anima banner to recede from the bonfire level to burning or from burning to glowing, and half an hour for her glowing anima to recede to dim.

## Anima Flux

When a Dragon-Blood’s anima banner rises to the bonfire level, her untamed elemental power spills from it as pure destructive force, called anima flux. At the bonfire level, she rolls one die of withering damage against all non-Dragon-Blooded characters within close range of her (including allies) at the start of each turn. She doesn’t gain Initiative from her anima flux.

Crashed characters and trivial enemies instead suffer one die of decisive lethal damage. Outside of combat, anima flux inflicts one die of lethal damage each minute. Characters with Hardness 1+ are unaffected by anima flux.

Anima flux may damage scenery if dramatically appropriate, setting cloth tapestries ablaze or shattering wooden walls with seismic force. For this reason, Dragon-Blooded favor sturdy stone architecture in their homes or other places where their anima banners might flare.

## Anima Effects

A Dragon-Blood’s anima powers are considered to be of her own elemental Aspect for purposes of her Elemental Aura (p. 162). By spending one mote, a Dragon-Blood may use one of the following effects: 
- She may perform minor manipulations of her Aspect’s element: cooling herself with a light breeze, igniting a fire without flint or tinder, causing a flower to blossom early at her touch. These never carry mechanical effects, but provide minor utility and can be incorporated into stunts. 
- Once she’s joined a Sworn Kinship (p. 104), she may sense the direction and approximate distance to another member of it.

In addition to these universal effects, Dragon-Blooded of each Aspect enjoy a number of innate benefits (ctrl + hover to preview):

# Lunar

A Lunar’s anima banner blazes forth into visibility as she expends Essence. **For every five motes of Peripheral Essence she spends in an instant, her anima banner rises one level.**

## Anima Levels
| Dim | The Lunar’s anima is invisible. This is its default level when she’s not spending Essence. |
| ---- | ---- |
| Glowing | The Lunar’s anima outlines her body in glowing light. Her Caste Mark appears, shining through anything placed over it. Her Tell and moonsilver tattoos become obvious to all who see her. Stealth and disguise rolls suffer a −3 penalty. |
| Burning | The Lunar’s anima shines in an argent aura around her. Objects touched by it may be left damp and warped, as if exposed to the night air and elements for many days. Her Caste Mark is subsumed into her anima, reappearing at dramatic moments. Stealth is impossible.  |
|  Bonfire/Iconic | The Lunar’s anima ignites into a brilliant bonfire stretching high into the sky, visible for miles around. Upon reaching bonfire, and at suitably dramatic moments, her anima manifests a personalized iconic display: a stylized depiction of her spirit shape, a quicksilver mirror depicting warped reflections, whirling blades inlaid with an intaglio of luminous runes, phantasmal limbs holding symbols of power, etc. Her anima completely illuminates her surroundings within short range. Stealth is impossible.  |
It takes 15 minutes for the anima banner to recede from bonfire to burning or from burning to glowing, and half an hour to recede from glowing to dim.

## Anima Effects

For one mote, a Lunar can: 
- Make her Caste Mark appear for as long as she desires. 
- Make her Tell obvious for as long as she desires. 
- Discern the moon’s phase and the precise time of day.
