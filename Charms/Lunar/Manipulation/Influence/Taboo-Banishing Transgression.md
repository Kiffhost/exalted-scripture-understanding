The Lunar disperses traditions and mores like half-remembered dreams. For a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge, [[Fox-Tailed Trickster’s Grace]] suppresses affected characters’ memory and knowledge of the violated custom. Any Principles that embody the affected custom are suppressed. She might cause Immaculate monks to forget their faith’s aniconism by erecting an idol to a local god beside their shrine. This lasts (6 – victim’s [[Integrity]]) hours, but affected characters are freed from it if they’re reminded of the custom.
