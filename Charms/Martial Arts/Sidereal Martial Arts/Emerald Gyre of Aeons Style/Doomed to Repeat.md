*The stylist intertwines her enemy’s failures in the present with the mistakes to be made in his future.*
The stylist can use this Charm after someone she can perceive fails a roll, making a special ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]) counterattack opposed his ([[Wits]] + [Integrity or Resistance]). If successful, he must repeat that action on his next turn (or repeat it immediately, outside of combat). He must target the same character, use the same [[Charms]], and so on — for instance, if he fails an attempt to seduce a merchant, he repeats the exact same words. He can still flurry the action normally. If changed circumstances make it impossible to repeat the action precisely, the enemy must repeat as much as possible. If the target of a failed attack has moved out of range, he may repeat the attack against a different enemy. If the enemy no longer has enough motes to pay the cost of all [[Charms]] used on the first action, he must use as many as possible on the second. 
## Reset
This Charm can’t be used against the same character more than once per scene.
