*The Exalt sees with eyes of fire, realizing the perfect path of a strike the moment before she suffers an attack.*
She may reflexively clash an attack against her with a decisive attack. This counts as her attack for the round, and can’t be used if she’s already made an attack this round. In Fire Aura, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Aura to clash without it counting as her attack for the round.
