*The Abyssal sloughs off the face she wore in life, revealing what has risen from her grave.*
The Abyssal’s appearance changes as death’s [[Essence]] permeates her body. The nature of this transformation depends on whether she has the [[Hideous]] Merit (Exalted, p. 162), which she may gain for free as part of learning this Charm.
An Abyssal without [[Hideous]] is suffused with deathly beauty: skin turns deathly pale or colors with rich vitality; hair darkens or pales; her lips and cheeks flushing with blood; etc.
An Abyssal with [[Hideous]] decays into a grotesque horror: her eyes sink deeper into her skull; skin wither, desiccates, or rots away entirely; blood or bile drips from her eyes, mouth, or skin; the scent of death clings to her; etc.
The Abyssal’s altered appearance adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on certain [[Influence roll|influence rolls]]. If she doesn’t have [[Hideous]], she does so on [[persuade]] and [[bargain]] rolls to seduce others and [[instill]] rolls to create or strengthen Ties based on desire for the Abyssal. If she has [[Hideous]], she does so [[threaten]] rolls and [[instill]] rolls to create or strengthen [[Intimacy|Tie]]s of fear toward herself.
Regardless of the nature of the Abyssal’s transformation, her distinctive appearance betrays her nature.
She suffers a −([[Appearance]]) penalty on [[Disguise]] rolls.
With [[Presence]] 3, the Abyssal adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice. With [[Essence]] 3, this increases to ([[Essence]] + 1).
