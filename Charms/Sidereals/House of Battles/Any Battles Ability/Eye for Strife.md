*The Sidereal recognizes the signs of struggle in another’s eyes.*
The Sidereal makes a special (Perception + Battles Ability) read intentions roll. Success lets her player ask the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every three extra successes
- What’s the most significant conflict in his life right now?
- What’s the most significant conflict in his past?
- What happened the last time he got into a violent or emotionally heated conflict?
- What’s the easiest way to provoke him to violence or open hostility?
If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
