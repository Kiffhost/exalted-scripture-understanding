A direlance is a massive spear forged with an alloy of one of the magical materials. Its sturdy construction allows it to be used to make mounted charges like a lance or be wielded as a long spear in melee. If used like a lance, the direlance may be used single-handed during a mounted charge. If used as a spear, a direlance requires two hands to wield.
