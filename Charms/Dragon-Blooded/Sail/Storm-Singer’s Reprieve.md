*Singing ancient rimes and sea shanties passed down across generations of sailors since the dawn of history, the Dragon-Blood appeals to the gods of the sea for mercy, dispersing thunderstorms or opening a path through hurricane winds.*
Faced with a weather-based maritime hazard or other troubled waters (Exalted, pp. 244-245), she may use this Charm to roll ([[Charisma]] + [[Sail]]) with double 9s against the hazardâ€™s difficulty. Success disperses the hazard entirely, without needing an extended [[Sail]] action. On a failed roll, she can still attempt to navigate the hazard normally. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset !!bysuccessfullydispersingorotherwisenavigatingthrough!! a hazard to continue sailing on to a location for the direct purpose of achieving a major character or story goal !!(Exalted,p.170)oralegendarysocialgoal(Exalted,p.134).!!
