*Death’s Lawgiver enacts an unquestionable decree, suffusing her dread authority, with the weight of the Old Laws.*
When the Abyssal enacts a law, rule, or regulation, she can pay an twelve-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use [[Accursed Overlord Authority]], imbuing it with one of her Defining Principles. It affects all who read or hear the law and are subject to its authority, though it doesn’t affect characters outside of whatever territory that rule applies to. It also affects any mindless undead in that locale. The Abyssal doesn’t have to proclaim the law by her own authority — as long as she’s involved in its enactment, she can use this Charm.
While the Charm is active, any written codification of the law within will bleed through any covering placed over it. The words outlast even physical destruction — if a carved stone stele is shattered, the Abyssal’s edict lingers in the very air.
The Abyssal can only have one such enhanced use of [[Accursed Overlord Authority]] at a time. This Charm isn’t compatible with [[Hateful Scorn Panopticon]] or [[Suffer No Betrayal]].
