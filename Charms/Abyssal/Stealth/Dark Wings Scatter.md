*Triumph turns to despair as the Abyssal is struck, only to dissolve into mist, black feathers, and fluttering raitons.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a decisive damage roll against her, before her attacker’s [[Initiative]] resets. She rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) opposing her attacker’s ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll, with each of them adding non-Charm successes equal to their [[Initiative]].
If the Abyssal succeeds, it’s revealed that the attack never struck her — only an illusion. She isn’t harmed by the attack, and counts as having dodged it, while her attacker is reset to base [[Initiative]]. She enters concealment against her attacker, while other enemies must make their own ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) rolls against her. The successes added by the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]] don’t apply against them.
If the Abyssal fails this roll, she resets to base [[Initiative]].
With [[Essence]] 5, if the Abyssal uses this Charm to evade damage that would have incapacitated her, she steals one [[Willpower]] from her attacker.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by using [[Atrocity Without Witness]] to establish concealment against all enemies in the seen.
