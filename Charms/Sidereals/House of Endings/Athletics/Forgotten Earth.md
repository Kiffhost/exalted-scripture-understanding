The Sidereal momentarily severs the invisible tether that binds her to the ground. The Sidereal can use a reflexive move action to jump one range band in any direction without needing to roll, which counts as her movement action. Alternatively, she can inflict +1 target number on a falling damage roll. With an Athletics 4, Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a three-mote surcharge to end a horizontal leap in mid-air. On her next turn, she must use this Charm again to continue the leap or fall to the ground. She can choose to descend one range band in addition to her forward movement.
