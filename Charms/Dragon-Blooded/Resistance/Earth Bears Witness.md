The Dragon-Blood braces her body solidly against the ground, feeling the Earth’s Essence upholding her own. As she’s struck, the force of the blow passes through her and into surrounding earth or stone. She subtracts (Stamina/2, rounded up) dice from the damage of a decisive attack, shunting it into the ground. The Storyteller may deem that this creates difficult terrain or destroys mundane objects. If there’s a large, dramatically significant source of stone or other earth-based substance, such as a boulder or stone pillar, within short range of the Exalt, she instead subtracts (Stamina) as it bears the force of the attack for her. The force of her enemy’s blow might smash a crater in the shape of her silhouette into a fortress’s walls or blast a stone monument from its pedestal. With Resistance 5, the Dragon-Blood may purchase the following elemental variants of this Charm for three experience points each. Water: In Water Aura, this Charm can shift (Stamina/2, rounded up) dice of decisive damage into any nearby water. It reduces damage by (Stamina) if she shifts it into a body of water or a large vessel, such as a cistern or a well. Wood: In Wood Aura, this Charm can shift (Stamina/2, rounded up) dice of decisive damage into wooden objects or living plants. It reduces damage by (Stamina) if she shifts it into a wooden structure or tree-sized plant.
