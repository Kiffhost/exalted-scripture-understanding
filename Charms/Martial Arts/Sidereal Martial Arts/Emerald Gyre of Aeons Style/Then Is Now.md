*All things revolve through eternity’s gyre, but the stylist has learned to spin back history.*
The stylist rolls (Intelligence + Lore) to revert an object within medium range to a state it held in the past. She could repair a broken weapon, rewind a door to a time before it was locked, or return an ancient skeleton to a fresh corpse to determine its cause of death. She can’t affect objects that are too large to fit within a single range band. If the object is being held, worn, or used by someone, the stylist must touch him, using her Lore roll in place of the gambit’s attack roll.
The amount of time the stylist can unwind, and the difficulty of doing so depends on whether the object is mundane or supernatural. For mundane objects, it’s difficulty 3 to undo up to a year, difficulty 5 for up to a decade, difficulty 7 for up to a century, or difficulty 10 for (Essence) centuries. The difficulty can’t exceed the difficulty to destroy the object with a feat of demolition.
Artifacts and other supernatural objects are much more difficult to affect; they can’t be reverted back by more than one day. This can potentially repair an artifact that’s been destroyed without the need for the usual project, if it’s done in time. For artifacts and hearthstones, the difficulty is (2 + their Merit rating), or 10 if they’re N/A-level. The Storyteller should assign other supernatural objects comparable difficulties.
### Enlightenment
Once per day, the stylist can use this Charm on a group of objects or a structure that fits within three range bands.
## Special activation rules
When an enemy destroys an object with a feat of demolition or similar action, the stylist can use this Charm reflexively, waiving its Willpower cost, to revert that object to just before it was broken. Her roll is opposed by the enemy’s feat of demolition or other roll instead of the usual difficulty, unless his action was unrolled.
