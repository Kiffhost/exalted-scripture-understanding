An attuned artifact socketed with this dark blue stone is as light as ever in the Exalt’s hands, but becomes as heavy as a boulder whenever she sets it down. Just shifting it a little ways is a Strength 5+, difficulty 7 feat of strength, while dragging it over a distance is a Strength 7+, difficulty 12 feat. (For an unattuned character to pull the stone from its socket is more difficult still — Strength 10+, difficulty 16). If an active opponent is prone, pinning him down with the socketed artifact is a difficulty 5 gambit, though the difficulty may vary with circumstances or for nonhuman opponents of unusual size or form.
