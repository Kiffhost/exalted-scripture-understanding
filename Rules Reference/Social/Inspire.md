The inspire action is used to incite emotions and strong passions in the hearts of others, usually with the [[Performance]] Ability, which those others then act on. When a player takes an inspire action, he chooses which emotion he is attempting to inspire—anger, sorrow, hope, lust, hatred, delight, or any other. On a successful [[Influence roll|inspire roll]], the target is impassioned according to the emotion evoked—but the *target’s player* chooses what form that passion takes.

An impassioned character might form a new passion, or act upon an existing [[Intimacy]] that aligns with the emotion evoked.

<summary>Examples</summary>
<ul>
<li>A tribal warrior-queen who is inspired with anger after hearing a [[Dawn]] Caste’s roaring oration against her enemies might decide to lead a raid against a hated rival clan, or might decide to begin harassing a political enemy within her own tribe. </li>
<li>A merchant prince who is filled with sorrow by the song of a [[Zenith]] Caste playing outside his window might spend the rest of the scene weeping with longing for a dead wife or might resolve to undertake some act of generosity with his fortune in remembrance of her kind-hearted ways.</li>
</ul>

A character doesn’t *have* to drop everything he’s doing to act upon an inspire action, but he must be genuinely resolved to action. If a devout follower of the Immaculate Philosophy is inspired to make a pilgrimage to the Imperial Mountain, he will generally set his affairs in order, supply himself for the journey, and explain to his family where he is going before setting off.

Inspiration doesn’t automatically create or strengthen [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], but it’s often appropriate for it to do so as characters act upon their inflamed passions. An inflamed passion may be treated as a Major [[Intimacy]] for the purposes of modifying [[Resolve]] and enabling [[Persuade]] actions, for as long as the character is acting on it.

The inspiring character *doesn’t* automatically know what passions he has inspired in his audience; he must use [[Read Intentions]] to find out. Because a character does not—and without magic, cannot—tailor the outcome of an inspire action to a specific target, inspire actions aren’t subject to the penalty for [[Social Influence#One Target vs. Many Targets|group influence]], unless specified by a Charm or other effect.

# Retry
You must wait until the scene has ended to retry an inspire action.
