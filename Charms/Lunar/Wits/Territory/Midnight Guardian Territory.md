*The Lunar’s eerie anima illumines her domain, marking it for her spirit shape’s nocturnal protection.*
That night, all who sleep in her territory dream of a great shining beast, watching over them through the long dark. This Charm can only be used within a territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]]. All characters therein gain Nightmare Beast Soul’s [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]] bonuses while sleeping. (The Lunar may exempt characters from this benefit.) The Lunar learns whenever a character in the territory falls prey to dream-affecting magic, unless that character’s player doesn’t consent to her learning that. She can spend one [[Willpower]] to fend off that effect with an opposed [[Willpower]] roll, as per [[Nightmare Beast Soul]]. If the dream-affecting magic targets multiple characters, she need only pay one [[Willpower]] to protect all of them with a single roll.
