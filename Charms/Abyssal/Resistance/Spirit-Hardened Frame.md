*Having died once, Abyssals quickly shrug off lesser wounds as inconsequential.*
The Abyssal reduces withering attacks’ raw damage and decisive attacks’ damage dice by two.
Against decisive attacks, the Abyssal also gains Hardness 4. If she already has Hardness from Flesh Like Marble (p. XX) or Transcendent Soulsteel Flesh (p. XX), she can instead add +2 to that Hardness.
