*Just as there is beauty in the budding and blossoming of flowers in the springtime seasons, so too is there a melancholy elegance in the fall of leaves as the autumnal seasons come in turn. It is with this mournful grace that the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan dispatches her victims.*
The [[Flurry of August Leaves]] enhances an attack based on the tags of the weapon used to make it. If the weapon has multiple valid tags, the martial artist can only choose one of the available options.
- **Clearing the Banquet Table** (Disarming): A successful disarm gambit allows the martial artist to fling her enemy’s weapon out to medium range (or long range, with [[Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form]] active). The [[Initiative]] cost of the gambit is waived. 
- **Lethal Paper Fan Attack** ([[Shield]]): As part of the attack, the martial artist may reflexively take a [[full defense]] action at no [[Initiative]] cost, effortlessly blending offensive and defensive motion in an elegant fan dance. 
- **Unraveling Loose Threads** (Piercing): A successful attack with a piercing weapon neutralizes the enemy’s armor, setting its base soak and hardness to zero against her for the next two rounds. 
- **Resplendent Sash Grapple** ([[Grappling]]): Upon landing a grapple gambit with a grappling weapon, the martial artist may waive the [[Initiative]] cost of the gambit and roll ([[Initiative]] + [[Essence]]) to determine how many rounds of control she gains (if this would be a higher pool than her usual control roll). If the enemy is at short range or further from her (for example, if she is using [[Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form]] to attack from range), he is immediately dragged to within close range of her as the weapon coils around him.
