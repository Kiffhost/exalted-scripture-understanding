The Solar burns with fearsome power, transforming her into an icon of terrible majesty. The Solar activates this Charm when her anima is at bonfire. This Charm inflicts supernatural terror upon all who see the Solar. This is modeled as a threaten action, but requires no words, and suffers no penalty from being unspoken or without specific gesture; the Solar is simply terrifying to behold. This effect also ignores the penalty for group influence. Trivial opponents and most animals, even attack animals, will simply flee the Solar’s presence. Those who fail their Resolve checks also flee. In combat, this effect can be perceived out to long distance, recurs every round without the need of a flurry, and may be resisted for the rest of the scene by paying one Willpower and five Initiative. Finally, a terrorized battle group suffers a loss of three dice from its rout checks (p. 208) when faced with the Solar’s immense and terrifying spiritual force.
