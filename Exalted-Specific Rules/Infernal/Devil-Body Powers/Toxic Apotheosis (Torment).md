This Torment inflicts a poison. For the one-dot version, the Infernal chooses Damage 3i/round, Duration 5 rounds, and −2 penalty, or a variant with Damage 2i/round, Duration 3 rounds, and a −3 penalty. For two dots, it has Damage 1L/minute, Duration 10 minutes, and a −5 penalty.

The Infernal’s player can work with the Storyteller to design alternative poisons with comparable traits.
