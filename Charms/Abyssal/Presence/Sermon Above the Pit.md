*To hear the Abyssal’s words is to hear the distant howl of the end, the soft crumbling of bones into dust — and dust into nothing at all.*
When the Abyssal makes an instill or persuade roll that leverages a negative Tie or a Principle that reflects a positive outlook on death, it also counts as an instill roll to create a related Intimacy. This fails if the target has a Major or Defining Intimacy that directly opposes the instilled Intimacy.
With a Presence 5 repurchase, this Charm can enhance rolls that are opposed by positive Ties or Principles that reflect a negative outlook on death, letting the Abyssal create Minor Tie opposed to that Intimacy.
The target is immune to this only if he has a Major or Defining Intimacy other than the one used to oppose the influence that opposes the instilled Intimacy.
