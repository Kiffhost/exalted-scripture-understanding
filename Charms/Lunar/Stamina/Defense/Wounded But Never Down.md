*The Lunar fights through the gravest wounds, sustained by illimitable rage.*
After a decisive damage roll against her, she can activate this Charm to negate levels of damage for one mote per level, maximum ([[Essence]] + [[Resistance]]) levels. Negated damage is withheld in a special pool. Damage heals from this pool at a rate of one level every two days, beginning with bashing damage. Magic that speeds natural healing also accelerates this process, and healing magic can be applied to damage stored in the pool. When this Charm ends, damage remaining in the pool returns to her health track. This Charm can be stacked up to ([[Essence]]) times, tracking all negated damage in a single pool. 
This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack that resets the Lunar’s [[Initiative]]. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Berserker, the Lunar reduces this Charm’s [[Initiative]] cost by her current wound penalty.
