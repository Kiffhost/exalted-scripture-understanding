The nightingale is no bird of prey, to swoop down with curved beak and cruel talons. Its greatest virtue is its song— and with that song, the students of Nightingale style give voice to their victory. This Charm allows the martial artist to make kiais, unleashing forceful waves of sound that strike her enemies like physical blows. A kiai has the traits of a mundane light weapon with the bashing and thrown (short) tags, save she rolls its attacks with Martial Arts (Silver-Voiced Nightingale style) rather than Thrown. The martial artist may flurry a kiai attack with Performance-based influence without the usual flurry penalties, as long as the content of the social influence is woven into the lyrics or emotional tenor of her song.
