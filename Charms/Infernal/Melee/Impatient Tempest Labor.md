*The Infernal has little patience for hesitation, wretchedly bored by enemies too slow to keep up with her.*

The Infernal can use this Charm at the beginning of a round if she’s within close range of an enemy. She takes her turn before all other characters and must use it to attack that foe. The only movement action she can take that turn is to rush him — or, if move away during her turn, a reflexive move action to pursue him.

With Melee 5, Essence 3, the Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge against an enemy with lower Initiative to add (Essence) dice of decisive or post-soak withering damage, plus additional damage dice equal to the difference in Initiative. The total damage bonus can’t exceed (Essence + 5) withering dice or (Essence + 1) decisive dice.
## Reset
Once the Infernal uses this Charm against an enemy, she can’t use it against him for the rest of the scene unless reset by crashing him.
