*The Infernal understands the cosmic principles that underly all creation, the unity of every art and craft.*

When the Infernal learns this Charm, each dot she has in a Craft Ability grants her an additional dot that she may place in another Craft Ability with a lower or equal rating. Likewise, each Craft dot the Infernal purchases with experience grants another dot that can be assigned to a Craft with an equal or lower rating.

For example, an Infernal with Craft (Alchemy) 2 and Craft (Smithing) 2 would receive four extra Craft dots when she learns this Charm. If she raises Alchemy to 3 later, she’d gain another Craft dot.
