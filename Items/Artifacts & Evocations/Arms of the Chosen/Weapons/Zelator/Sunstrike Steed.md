*While the Exalt is mounted, her mount gains Zelator’s power to make baneful attacks.*
In addition, whenever the Exalt can perceive an immaterial entity, her mount can both see and strike that entity. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with orichalcum, this Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder Joins Battle against any enemy that [[Zelator]] is baneful against while mounted.
