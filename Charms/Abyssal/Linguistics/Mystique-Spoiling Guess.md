*The Abyssal’s extensive reading and preternatural intuition make clear the meanings of even the most cryptic texts.*
When the Abyssal reads a text, she makes a special ({[[Intelligence]] or [[Perception]]} + [[Linguistics]]) [[read intentions]] roll against its writer. Success lets her player ask the [[Storyteller]] one of the following questions about the writer, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes.
 - Is he hiding anything in this text?  
 - Which of his Intimacies is most strongly related to this text?  
 - How could I learn his identity?  
 - What regrets does he have that are related to the text? 
Against a dead writer, the Abyssal may ask an additional question, even if she fails.
If the [[Storyteller]] doesn’t have an answer in mind, the Abyssal’s player should provide one, as if [[introducing a fact]].
