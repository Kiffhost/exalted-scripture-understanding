*The Abyssal’s arrow freezes and shatters in mid-air, showering razor-sharp ice on friend and foe alike.*
The Abyssal makes a [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack roll]] against all other characters — friend or foe — within [[Range#Medium|medium range]] of a point within her weapon’s range. This makes it possible to attack foes beyond her weapon’s range.
The attack has a base damage of ([[Perception]]) dice against each hit enemy, and she divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among them. [[Battle group|Battle groups]] and trivial characters aren’t included in dividing up her [[Initiative]], but still suffer the same damage as other foes.
If the Abyssal’s attack benefits from [[Aim|aiming]], she may avoid harming allies instead of that action’s usual benefit.
