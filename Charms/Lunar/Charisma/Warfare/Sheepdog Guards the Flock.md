*The Lunar rallies her armies in defense of her chosen peoples, holding the line against the forces that would see them enslaved or eradicated.*
To use this Charm, the Lunar must be fighting in defense of a culture she has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward, or leading battle groups made up primarily of such a culture’s members. She grants an allied battle group the following benefits:  - +1 [[Might]].
 - Its positive Ties to the Lunar or the culture increase its [[Resolve]] bonus by +1.
 - It rerolls 1s until they cease to appear on rout checks.
 - Upon reaching [[Size]] 3 or lower, it gains perfect morale for the rest of the scene, as its remaining members make a defiant last stand.
The Lunar can stack multiple uses of this Charm to benefit multiple battle groups. She waives this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost for each battle group past the first.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
