*As the Sidereal places a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden on the Shelf across her eyes, it adheres and begins to drip with dark blood, an omen of the violence she is about to inflict.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
- She ignores vision-based penalties, even blindness. 
- Once per round, she may reflexively clash an attack against her with a decisive attack. If she knows [[Fateful Exchange]], she can clash attacks that aren’t made against her. 
- She may raise her [[Defense|Parry]] with the [[Melee]] Excellency for one mote per +1 bonus. 
- She ignores [[Defense|Parry]] penalties from surprise attacks and waives the [[Willpower]] surcharge to block an ambush with Serenity in Blood’s repurchase. 
- She Excellencies’ costs to reduce the target number of [[Perception]]-based rolls with any Ability in combat.
