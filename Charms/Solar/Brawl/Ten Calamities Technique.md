While controlling a clinch, the Solar locks a ruinous hold on her captive in an attempt to force his submission. The player can describe this as any kind of signature joint lock, chokehold, or scenery-assisted torment they can imagine, applying the damage roll normally. Remember, savaging attacks always hit, and serve only to boost the damage result, per the rules described on page 201. Each consecutive round the character inflicts damage with a grapple, her raw damage growsâ€”+2 per round for withering or +1 for decisive. Thus, a character who made three withering attacks and then a decisive attack would enjoy bonuses of +2, +4, +6 and +4 respectively. Decisive attacks made with this Charm ignore hardness. [[Ten Calamities Technique]] does not enhance throws or slams.
