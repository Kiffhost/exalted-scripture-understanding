Memory-Drinking Meditation The Lunar tastes potent inspiration in the heart’s blood of renowned artisans and legendary craftsmen. Upon learningthisCharm,shegainstensilverpoints.Additionally,she gains craft points for meeting basic objectives as though she’dcompletedabasicproject(Exalted,p.240)whenshe claimstheshapeofahumanwithatleastoneCraftratedat 3+, or that the Storyteller deems a professional artisan. At the Storyteller’s discretion, animals capable of significant crafting can also grant this reward. If the Lunar claims the formofahumanwithCraft([[Artifact]])orCraft(Geomancy) 1+, she’s rewarded as per a major project instead. A Lunar with [[Demon-Drinking Fang]] (p.
