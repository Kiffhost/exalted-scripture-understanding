Closing her eyes and entering a trance, the sorcerer projects her awareness into a tree that bears her visage. To use this spell, the sorcerer must have first carved a life-sized likeness of her face into the bark of a living tree, a basic Craft (Woodworking) project with difficulty 1. Casting this spell lets her perceive and speak through the face, regardless of distance. She may make Perception-based rolls from its vantage or make influence rolls as she speaks through it, but cannot enhance her actions with Charms. While using this spell, she can’t sense anything through her own body nor take actions with it, unless she chooses to end it prematurely. Taking damage automatically ends this spell. While the sorcerer isn’t speaking, her projected presence can’t be detected without the use of magic. A character who knows or suspects that a tree has been marked for use with this spell may destroy the carved visage to render it unusable. This usually doesn’t require a roll, unless the tree has been reinforced with other magic. 

A sorcerer with this as her control spell may simultaneously project herself into up to (Perception) separate wooden faces, seeing and speaking through all of them simultaneously. 
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 5)
To distort this spell, a sorcerer must be within short range of the tree, not the sorcerer. Distortion renders the wooden face [[blind]], [[deaf]], and [[mute]], plunging the casting sorcerer into sensory isolation that causes her to lose one Willpower.
