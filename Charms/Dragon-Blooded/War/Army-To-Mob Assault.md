*The Dragon-Blood overwhelms enemy forces with tactics designed to spread confusion and chaos.*
When an allied battle group attacks an enemy battle group under the Dragon-Blood’s orders, she converts ([[Manipulation]]) bonus dice granted to the battle group’s attack by her command to automatic successes. If this empties the enemy battle group’s Magnitude, add +1 to the difficulty of its roll to resist rout.
