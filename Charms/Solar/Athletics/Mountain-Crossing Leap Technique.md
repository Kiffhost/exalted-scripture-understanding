*The Solar gathers enormous spiritual pressure into her legs and launches herself skyward.*
The Exalt makes a wild leap four range bands forward or three straight up. As the force of her leap is almost uncontrolled, she may not leap fewer than three range bands with this Charm. This Charm stays active every turn until the Solar stops leaping across range bands, making it possible for the Exalt to cross a mountain range in minutes. If this Charm is combined with [[Monkey Leap Technique]], the Exalt can make a controlled leap to the second range band. If opponents are within close range before the Exalt activates this Charm, she must succeed at a disengage action before it can be activated. All minor opponents within close range when the Solar uses this Charm suffer automatic knockdown, and more impressive opponents may need to roll to keep their balance.
