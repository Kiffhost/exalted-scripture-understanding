*The martial artist’s body becomes tenebrous and insubstantial, dissipating and deforming to let blows pass harmlessly through her.*
[[Shadow-Body Dissolution]] subtracts the martial artist’s ([[Essence]] + [[Stealth]]) from the raw damage of a decisive attack against her. If the martial artist takes no damage at all from the attack, she may reflexively make a [[Stealth]] attempt. On a successful roll, what her foe struck at was nothing but a shadowy illusion, while she had been hidden elsewhere all along. This Charm is incompatible with other effects that reduce decisive damage. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood must roll ([[Essence]] + [[Stealth]]), with each success subtracting one die of damage. If all damage is negated this way, then the successes from this roll are used as her stealth attempt, rather than having her make a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]] roll).
