Drawing down on a crashed opponent, the Lawgiver channels all the fury of her anima into her fists and strikes a world-rending blow. This is an unblockable, undodgeable withering attack with double 7s on the damage roll. The Solarâ€™s anima must be at bonfire in order to use this Charm, as she sheds her entire anima into the attack and returns to the dim level.
