*Few can run fast or far enough to escape the Infernal’s wrath.*

The Infernal adds a non-Charm die on rush actions and opposed Athletics rolls in speed-based competitions.

This Charm can be purchased up to (lower of Essence or Athletics) times.
### Keys 
#### Unimpeded Perfection of Exertion
As long as the Infernal moves at full speed without stopping, she has perfect balance and can move across surfaces too narrow or weak to support her weight without needing to roll. Her light-footed tread imposes a −1 penalty on rolls to track her and on Awareness rolls opposing her Stealth.
