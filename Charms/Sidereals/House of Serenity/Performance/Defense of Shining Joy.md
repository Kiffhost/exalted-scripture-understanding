The Sidereal anticipates her enemyâ€™s every move as if they were dancing together, maneuvering gracefully in perfect counterpoint to his offense. The Sidereal adds (Appearance/2, rounded up) Evasion against an attack and dodges even if its successes equal her Evasion. Dodging a decisive attack grants her the Initiative her attacker loses for missing.
