The Sidereal invokes her intrinsic authority over the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] to promote a familiar into its ranks. The Sidereal transforms one of her familiars into a god, conferring the following benefits: 
- He gains a human-level faculty for complex and abstract thought and the ability to understand the Sidereal’s native tongue and Old Realm. 
- His natural state is dematerialized. 
- He gains a pool of ten personal motes, if he didn’t have one already, and the Materialize Charm (Exalted, p. 510). 
- He may spend five motes as if using a Simple Charm to transform into a human-like shape that still bears signs of his animal form. His traits remain unchanged, but his human-like anatomy may let him avoid certain penalties. Changing back to his animal form works the same way. 
- If killed without magic capable of permanently destroying spirits, he reforms at the story’s end (Exalted, p. 509). 
- He gains a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of obligation to the Sidereal. No influence, other than the Sidereal’s, can make him act against this [[Intimacy]]. This Charm’s experience cost is waived the first time the Sidereal uses it. If an enhanced familiar is permanently killed, the Sidereal regains any experience spent enhancing him.
