*The crane is sacred in its beauty, a bird of celestial splendor and serene repose. Such are the virtues that the Crane master may teach to her disciples with the final move of this style.* 
[[Wisdom of the Celestial Crane]] can be used when the martial artist makes a decisive counterattack in response to an enemy’s decisive attack. Gambits, as well as the attacks of battle groups and trivial opponents, do not provide the opportunity to use this Charm.
The martial artist adds her enemy’s [[Initiative]] to the raw damage of the attack in addition to her own. Incapacitating an enemy with [[Wisdom of the Celestial Crane]] is always nonfatal, and allows the martial artist to choose any of her opponent’s Intimacies that fit the criteria set out in [[Humbling Enlightenment Commentary]], and strengthen it to Defining intensity. Alternatively, she may leave her foe with a Defining Tie of love towards all Creation. 
## Reset
[[Wisdom of the Celestial Crane]] can only be used once per combat, unless reset by going three rounds without being hit by an attack or making an attack (not including counterattacks). 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood cannot add more bonus dice to the raw damage of the attack than her current [[Initiative]] with this Charm. 
## Mastery
If the martial artist successfully defends against the attack that triggers the counterattack, then his enemy loses all [[Initiative]] and is crashed.
