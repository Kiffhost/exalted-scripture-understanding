*The Lunar’s superior force of personality overwhelms opposing viewpoints.*
She makes an influence roll against one character; if he bolsters [[Resolve]] with an [[Intimacy]] directly opposing one of the Lunar’s own, she adds non-Charm successes equal to the [[Resolve]] bonus. She need not be aware of the [[Intimacy]] before she makes the roll, nor does she learn what it is.
