A ship’s crew isn’t as intrinsic to the vessel as the rigging of her sails or the draft of her keel, but they’re no less vital to her operation. A ship’s captain may add a +2 bonus to all Sail rolls to command her vessel if the average Sail score of her crew is 4+. If her crew has an average of Sail 1 or below, by contrast, she takes a -1 penalty to all Sail rolls.
