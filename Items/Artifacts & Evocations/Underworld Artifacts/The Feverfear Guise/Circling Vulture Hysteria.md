*Gossip is a powerful contagion, spreading like plague as the Guise’s master warns of dooms to come.*
## Resonant
Only characters resonant with the Feverfear Guise can awaken this Evocation.
The wearer can pay a five-mote surcharge to use [[Creeping [[Plague]] Suggestion]] against multiple characters, describing a disease’s symptoms and vectors of contagion.
Rather than developing an Obsession immediately, affected characters only do so if they believe they’ve been exposed to a vector of infection, . If the wearer prescribed a course of treatment as part of her warning, it’s included in their Obsession as if she’d use Snakeskin Wine Treatment.
Such Obsessions fade after (wearer’s [[Essence]]) days, although failing a [[Willpower]] roll against it resets that. If an affected character goes an entire session without encountering a vector, he’s freed from this Psyche effect.
This Evocation is incompatible with Creeping [[Plague]] Suggestion’s resonant repurchase — the wearer must strengthen victims’ Obsessions one-by-one.
