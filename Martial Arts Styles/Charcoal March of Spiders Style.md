# Charcoal March of Spiders Style
It’s said this style was created when an ancient Sidereal witnessed Asna Firstborn, mother of pattern spiders, kill and consume her mate. Enlightened by the sublime horror-beauty of the act, they attained an understanding of the cosmic principles of consumption. Its practitioners emulate the movements of pattern spiders, striking with venomous techniques that devour Essence, dissolve souls, and reweave reality. Students fast throughout their training as they undergo grueling regimens that hone their body and guide them to this style’s enlightenment: elaborate footwork drills, aerial contortions while dangling upside-down from silken threads, striking the surface of vats of poison and acid, and meditating while surrounded with heaping platters of delicacies. 
## Weapons
This style’s unarmed attacks are sweeping rapid kicks and four-fingered strikes that can jab pressure points as easily as they gouge eyes. It’s also compatible with fighting chains, knives, meteor hammers, nunchaku, rope darts, seven-section staffs, and whips. Unarmed attacks enhanced with this style’s Charms can be stunted to deal lethal damage.
## Armour
This style is incompatible with armor.
## Complementary Abilities
Athletics supports stylists’ mobility. 
## Nature
Flowing.
