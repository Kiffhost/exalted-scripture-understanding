*Violence leaves stains more indelible than blood.*
The Abyssal makes a special [[case scene]] or [[profile character]] roll to sense lingering traces of violent acts.
On a successful [[case scene]] roll, she experiences a nightmare-like vision of an act of violence that’s taken place at that location. Successfully profiling a character likewise gives her a vision of one of his violent acts. While these visions reveal the general nature of the act, they’re too hazy and distorted to give an accurate depiction of events or reveal the identities of those involved.
By default, the [[Storyteller]] should choose whichever violent event is most relevant to the Abyssal’s current intentions. Alternatively, an Abyssal may choose to view either the first act of violence or the most recent one. However, traces of violence fade over time, depending on the nature of the act:
 - Physical altercations, minor scuffles, and the like can be detected linger for days.
 - Acts of violence that cause significant physical harm or emotional trauma linger for weeks.
 - Death or torture lingers for years.
 - Battles, mass executions, and the like linger for decades.
 - Acts that cause a shadowland to open linger indefinitely unless the shadowland is closed.
