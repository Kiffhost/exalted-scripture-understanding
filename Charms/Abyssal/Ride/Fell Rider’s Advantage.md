*The deathknight and her pale steed fight as one, riding down their foes with murderous focus.*
When the Abyssal or her mount makes a decisive attack while she’s mounted, the other character can transfer up to half her Initiative, rounded up, to the attacker. This Charm can also be used when either of them would be crashed and can be used after a withering damage roll.
