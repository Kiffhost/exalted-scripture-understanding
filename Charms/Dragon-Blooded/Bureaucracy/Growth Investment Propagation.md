*A savvy player of the market, the Dragon-Blood conceals funds in profitable investments and revenue-earning ventures, ensuring she always has savings to draw on for unexpected expenses.*
When she makes a purchase using her [[Resources]] rating (Exalted, p. 578), she may expend these saved funds, treating her [[Resources]] rating as though it were two dots higher for purposes of that transaction, and doubling 7s on any bargain roll involved in the transaction. If this would raise her effective [[Resources]] rating above 5, she can instead make a [[Resources]] 5 purchase without incurring any debt.
Using this Charm entails revealing the existence of funds the Dragon-Blood has acquired off-screen, not creating money ex nihilo. In circumstances where it wouldn’t make sense for the Dragon-Blood to access her investments, the Storyteller may require an appropriate stunt to justify using this Charm — a Dragon-Blood marooned on a far-off Western island can’t call in her savings, unless she reveals she’s been funding trade with the island’s natives.
This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by completing a project with a primary goal of amassing wealth or creating a profitable investment.
