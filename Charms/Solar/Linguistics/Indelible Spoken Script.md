*The Lawgiver’s words emblazon a solid surface in the vibrant, multi-hued colors of Solar anima.*
This creates a message no longer than two breaths in spoken length, and lays it over a space up to ([[Essence]] x 3) yards wide or (x 5) high. This message appears in the runes, pictograms, or letters of the language the Exalt is speaking. If she wishes to infuse this message with Written-only [[Linguistics]] magic, she may pay to do so at this time, treating Simple-type Linguistic [[Charms]] as if they were Reflexive. The Solar must be within fifty yards of the surface she is speaking words onto. Anyone who reads this message is subject to any social influence entailed in the script — usually modeled as a typical contest of [[Linguistics]] vs. [[Resolve]] — but only the first time they read it. As long as the Solar keeps motes committed to this effect, the script cannot be scrubbed from the surface of the wall, and any attempt to write over it fails. If the script it painted over, it bleeds through. Any attempt to otherwise cover it ends in horrific botches. The only way to remove the Lawgiver’s words are to kill her, destroy the surface her words are written on, or use a special sorcerous working (Terrestrial Circle, Ambition 2, Finesse 1, Terminus 3). This sorcerous working costs no experience points, but requires one point of temporary [[Willpower]] on each one week interval. Failing to reach the goal by the terminus makes this effect immune to any sorcerous tampering by any sorcerer for two weeks. This failure can be noticed by a character using [[All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight]] (Exalted p. 356) or similar magic. By paying one [[Willpower]] when activating this Charm, the Lawgiver raises the difficulty of removing her words with a sorcerous working to (Terrestrial Circle, Ambition 2, Finesse 3, Terminus 1) and can choose to gouge her words into a surface as hard as granite.

### On [[Indelible Spoken Script]]

When I note that the failure can be noticed with AllEncompassing Sorcerer’s Sight, I am not only referring to the temporary invincibility of the effect, but also the sorcerer who failed the working. A sorcerer who looks into the world of [[Essence]] will see the failed sorcerer emblazoned with the Solar’s message.
