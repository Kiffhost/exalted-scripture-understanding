*Baying to drive demons back to the depths of Hell, the Lunar banishes body-riding phantasms and spiritual parasites.*
She rolls ([[Intelligence]] + {Lore, [[Occult]], or Presence}) against a possessing spirit’s [[Resolve]] to exorcise it. Success drives it from its host, and prevents it from possessing him again until the next new moon. If the Lunar successfully uses this Charm within a circle created with [[Argent Guardian Yantra]], she may invert the ward to contain spirits rather than keeping them out. 
## Protean 

In shapes that the possessing spirit has a fear-based Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward, every extra success on the Lunar’s roll strips one [[Willpower]] from him if his [[Essence]] doesn’t exceed hers.
