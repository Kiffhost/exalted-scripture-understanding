TheLunarsubmergesherconsciousmindinthedepths of the countless beasts that teem in her [[Essence]]. After successfully asserting [[Guile]] against a read intentions roll with at least a single 1, she may use this Charm, causing the opposing character to believe he succeeded. However, instead of the truth, he sees only an animalistic drive of her choice — hunger, aggression, lust, etc. — and disregards her until end of scene unless her actions prompt further attention. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar uses this Charm in an animal’s shape, it causes the opposing character to instead see only the instincts and drives typical to a normal animal of that kind. She may use it even after a successful read intentions roll, as long as it contained at least a single 1.
