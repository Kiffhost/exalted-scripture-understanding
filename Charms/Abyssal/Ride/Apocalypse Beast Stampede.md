*The world trembles as Death’s Lawgiver rides to battle, quaking beneath the hoof beats of catastrophe made flesh.*
The Abyssal’s mount makes a decisive attack against all enemies within close range, which also counts as a threaten roll against enemies who witness it. The attack is unblockable and undodgeable, but can be opposed with a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) or ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll. It makes a separate damage roll against each hit enemy with its full [[Initiative]], maximum 10 dice. Even if a character successfully defends, he falls prone unless he rolled 3+ extra successes on his opposed roll. This counts as both the Abyssal’s and the steed’s attack for the round.
The attack also counts as a feat of demolition against objects and structures within range, doubling the attack roll’s successes to determine its effect. The mount adds (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) to its [[Strength]] to determine what feats it can achieve, and can complete lengthy demolitions instantly.
If the Abyssal’s mount has Legendary [[Size]], this Charm’s range increases to short. If she uses [[Saddled in Epic Monstrosity]] to increase a Legendary [[Size]] mount further, the attack extends to medium range.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal wins [[Join Battle]], she can use this Charm reflexively. If her opposition includes battle groups, she automatically enacts a [[Demoralized]] stratagem (Exalted, p. 212).
