The Dragon-Blood’s lulling speech and hypnotic bearing muddles the memory of an enemy, rival, or ill-treated acquaintance, banishing a past event that would reflect poorly on a current conversation to the depths of his unconscious. She makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Socialize]]) instill roll against a single character to suppress his memory of a single incident of her past misbehavior. She takes a penalty determined by the Storyteller based on the misconduct’s severity — an insult without lasting consequences might suffer no penalty; petty theft or humiliation in front of a small group might suffer a −1 penalty; inflicting a disfiguring wound or public humiliation before a large group might suffer a −3 penalty; a murder attempt might suffer a −5 penalty. Success suppresses the chosen memory, allowing the Dragon-Blood to interact with her victim for a single scene as though it never happened. The victim cannot bring it up or even remember it, rationalizing away any inconsistencies this causes. If he has a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards the Dragon-Blood based on the erased memory, it’s likewise suppressed. If the [[Intimacy]] is based on more than one transgression, the Dragon-Blood must erase them all with multiple uses of this Charm to suppress the [[Intimacy]]. If the victim’s loss of memory would cause him to act inconsistently with a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]], other than a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] for the Dragon-Blood, he may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist. However, he’s unaware she caused his memory lapse. A [[Socialize]] 5, [[Essence]] 5 repurchase allows the Dragon-Blood to expend her Water Aura to permanently erase the targeted memory with this Charm. The penalty for erasing egregious misdeeds subtracts successes instead of dice. The victim may still resist, as above, but doing so only restores the memory for a single scene. Once he’s spent three total [[Willpower]] resisting, the memory is restored permanently.
