When the Solar controls a familiar using the Sense-Riding Discipline effect of [[Spirit-Tied Pet]], she can indict the senses of her enemies. While taking the form of her familiar, the Exalt may activate any [[Stealth]] [[Charms]] she knows to protect her familiar-self from detection. Familiars which are large, unusual, or otherwise unsuited to stealth may incur penalties to normal [[Stealth]] actions based on unfavorable circumstances—a claw strider slinking through a forest can be difficult to notice, but a claw strider skulking through the shadowed streets of Nexus suffers a -2 penalty.
