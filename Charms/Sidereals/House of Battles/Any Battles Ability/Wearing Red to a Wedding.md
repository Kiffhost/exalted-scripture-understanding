*The world’s a cruel and unhappy place.*
That’s just how it is! People won’t comment on or otherwise react to the Sidereal openly brandishing arms or armor, dripping with blood, or showing other signs of battle, nor will they assume the Sidereal poses a threat to them. These never penalize her social rolls. Nontrivial characters can spend one [[Willpower]] to react normally to the Sidereal for a scene. This Charm ends if the Sidereal attacks or takes other overtly hostile action.
