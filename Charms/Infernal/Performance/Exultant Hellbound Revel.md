*The Infernal rouses irresistible passions, bidding her audience to join her in wild revels and decadent debauches.*

The Infernal makes an (Appearance + Performance) inspire roll. Affected characters’ players still choose how they respond to the inspired emotion, but most do so in an overt, dramatic, and potentially excessive way: raucous celebration, overexaggerated displays of grief, or even furious riots. This costs two Willpower to resist. Trivial characters can’t resist.
