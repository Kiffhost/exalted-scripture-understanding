Grim Saturn sees every possible ending, smiling only when they come to pass at their appointed hour. Her Chosen ensure these endings come to pass only as Heaven wills. They are assassins of those who defy their destined deaths, exorcists and psychopomps guiding the undead to reincarnation within fate’s order, magistrates purging institutional corruption, and physicians battling plagues. But their sobriquet as Destiny’s Gardeners isn’t just a euphemism. They’re guardians, healers, and caretakers as often as they are killers, lest an untimely ending snarl destiny. The tapestry of fate is Heaven’s garden, and it must be nourished and pruned in equal measure.

The First Age’s Reckoners were hunters and slayers of Creation’s foes, the sword to the shield of Mars’ Chosen. They led preemptive strikes that decapitated the leadership of faerie warbands and monstrous armies, passed judgment on forbidden gods escaped from their gaols, and banished prehuman horrors awakened from the Underworld by the Neverborn’s death. They warned their fellow Chosen of future perils, whether fending off night-grim assassins as a sorcerer-queen’s consort and sentinel or seeking out corruption and disloyalty within a god-kings’ dominion.

The Second Age is a time of many endings, and Saturn’s Chosen are stretched thin. The nature of their duty has changed little with the passage of ages, but it’s grown all the more difficult. Poverty, war, and pestilence cut short countless lives, while kingdoms, religions, and cultures fall long before their destined end. All the while, Creation’s foes grow ever stronger, claiming new champions who threaten Heaven itself. The Reckoners remain resolute in the face of this, their conviction untarnished by despair. So long as there is something left that they can sacrifice of themselves, the Age of Sorrows has not defeated them.

Destined Reckoners’ mortal lives are touched by death. Some lost a parent, sibling, friend, or lover at a formative time in their life, while others faced the imminent possibility of their own death. Some belong to ancestor cults or have other interaction with the undead, whether as a denizen of the shadowlands, an exorcist or ghost channeler, or a student of necromancy. Others live through times of great upheaval and death: plagues, falling regimes, famines, and worse. Some are predisposed to dour professionalism, abiding melancholy, or morose brooding by this, but others find solace in asceticism, dark humor, or joie de vivre.

# Auspicious Prospects
## Auspicious Prospects for Endings

The Reckoner may pay one mote to determine whether an ending would align with destiny and any relevant details of a destined ending, like how someone’s supposed to die. 

## Lesser Sign of Saturn

The Reckoner may pay five motes to reflexively make Saturn’s lesser sign, trailing violet stardust from her fingertips. Until her next turn, she and all allies within close range add (Sidereal’s Essence, maximum 5) Overwhelming on withering attacks and add an automatic success on decisive damage rolls. This is free at bonfire. 

## Greater Sign of Saturn

Once per story, the Reckoner may pay twenty and one Willpower to make Saturn’s greater sign, shining brilliant violet in the sky above. This takes her entire turn. She and her allies gain −1 target number on damage rolls, or −2 against enemies of fate, and ignore Hardness. Un-Exalted enemies can’t take crippling injuries (Exalted, p. 201) and automatically fail rolls against poison, disease, and crippling effects. Medicine rolls to treat their ailments likewise fail. Those slain in battle pass unto Lethe, though powerful Exalted still require proper burial rituals to ensure they won’t linger as hungry ghosts.
