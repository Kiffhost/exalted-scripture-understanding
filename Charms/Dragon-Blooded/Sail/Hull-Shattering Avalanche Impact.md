The Dragon-Blood’s anima banner enfolds her ship as it builds speed, growing into an insurmountable onslaught of force to smash through enemy ships or fortifications. She undertakes a ram stratagem in naval combat (Exalted, p. 245) with double 8s. A successful stratagem inflicts an additional point of [[Hull]] damage. Outside of combat, this Charm can be used to demolish a seafaring structure or obstacle by ramming it. This is a feat of strength (Exalted, p. 229) rolled using ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]), adding (the ship’s Speed) non-Charm bonus dice. This Charm can be used to attempt feats that normally require up to [[Strength]] 10, as long as the Storyteller deems it feasible based on the size of the ship. This Charm can only be used once per day.
