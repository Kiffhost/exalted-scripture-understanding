*The Lunar weaves between beams of light, hiding in the thinnest shadows.*
She ignores penalties on a [[Stealth]] roll from any source of illumination other than her anima banner. This may render it possible to attempt concealment in locations that would otherwise be inadequate hiding spots. This Charm costs an additional [[Willpower]] if the Lunar is currently visible to any enemies. For an instant, she flickers and blurs, receding into the shadows. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has the [[Night Vision]] Merit may learn this as a Perception Charm, with [[Sense-Sharpening Change]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
