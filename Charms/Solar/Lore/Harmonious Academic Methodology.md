*The Solar’s mind covers a spectrum of mastered topics.*
With this Charm, add the Solar’s [[Essence]] in non-Charm automatic successes to any [[Lore]] roll that involves a [[Lore]] specialty. In addition, the player may add an additional [[Lore]] specialty to her list of [[Lore]] topics at the end of each story. The Storyteller may veto any particular topic, in which case the player is allowed to choose another specialty that’s more acceptable. Finally, at any point in which the Solar succeeds at a moderately or extremely difficult roll to introduce or [[Challenging a Fact|challenge a fact]] (p. 237), the player may request to add a related topic to the Solar’s library of known topics. As with all other topics, this is allowable only at the Storyteller’s discretion.
