*The Solar magnifies her physical [[Essence]], increasing her ability to move massive loads.*
This Charm supplements an attempt to lift or break something, allowing the Solar to attempt an action with a prerequisite beyond her current [[Strength]] rating. Pay two motes and roll the Exalt’s ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) as normal, converting each three successes into a dot of [[Strength]] as needed, until the Solar meets the prerequisite. This bonus [[Strength]] does not enhance her current dice pool, as this momentary surge of might only establishes whether she can succeed with her current dice. Note that she must still have enough successes remaining, after increasing her [[Strength]], to meet the difficulty requirement of the feat.

## Sidebar
For example, the Solar sees a laden wagon sinking into a sand pit. She has [[Strength]] 5, and no time to activate Increasing-[[Strength]] Exercise—perhaps someone will die if she does not act instantly. According to the rules on page 229, this feat requires [[Strength]] 7, and twelve successes on a ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) roll. She grabs the hitch, channeling from deep within her reservoirs of might to try to pull it free anyway.
The player invokes a full [[Athletics]] Excellency, [[Thunder’s Might]] and [[Ten Ox Meditation]], rolling eighteen successes. The player spends six of these successes to raise the Solar’s [[Strength]] by two—the minimum needed to accomplish the feat. Because the player still has twelve successes left over, and has raised the Solar’s [[Strength]] to 7, the Exalt is able to pull the wagon from the sand trap immediately.
