These fearsome weapons are First Age relics whose workings remain beyond the full understanding of any present-day engineer or savant. Resembling a ballista mounted upon a heavy gimbaled pedestal, these mechanisms appear to be made from a dark, glossy, wine-red wood with elaborate inlays and fittings of the five magical materials and diamond-like adamant. An implosion bow fires a spherical pulse of space-warping [[Essence]] that collapses in on itself upon impact, creating a disintegrating vortex that draws in both light and matter. 

An implosion bow must be powered with a hearthstone. This stone doesn’t provide increased mote recovery to its master, although it still provides its other effects.

[[Collapsing Point of Destruction]] is automatically learned on attunement at no cost.
