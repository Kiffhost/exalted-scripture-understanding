*The Abyssal reveals her inner nature, consuming the minds of those who can’t accept this revelation.*
The deathknight causes a [[read intentions]] action against her to fail automatically unless the opposing character accepts (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or Anima) dice of [[Health Track#Aggravated|aggravated decisive damage]] to look upon the unbearable truth she embodies. This damage can’t be prevented by any means.
If the Abyssal successfully asserts her [[Guile]] against a character who chose to accept the damage, that character believes he succeeded…only to discover a truth terrible beyond words. He gains a Major [[Intimacy|Principle]] related to death, the dead, or the Underworld to represent this revelation’s impact, chosen by the deathknight’s player. Her victim can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist this.
For the rest of the scene, any of the Abyssal’s influence that leverages the inflicted [[Intimacy]] costs an additional [[Willpower]] to resist.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses this Charm together with [[Fathomless Inner Night]], she can choose to threaten her target if he fails, rather than [[Instill|instilling]] an [[Intimacy]].
