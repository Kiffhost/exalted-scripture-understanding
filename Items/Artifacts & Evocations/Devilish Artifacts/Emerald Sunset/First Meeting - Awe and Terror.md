*The wielder plucks her bowstrings, releasing a keening song of dread.*

When the wielder flurries an aim action with a threaten roll against the enemy she aims at, she adds the bonus from aiming on the threaten roll as well as her attack. If she beats a demon’s Resolve with the threaten roll, she steals one Initiative from it.

Until the wielder makes an attack enhanced by the aim action, enemies whom she’s successfully threatened this scene suffer a −2 penalty on attack rolls and similar harmful rolls against her. She loses this benefit if she doesn’t attack by the end of her next turn.

Allied demons who witness a successful threaten action against a non-trivial enemy gain +1 Resolve against fear-based effects for the rest of the scene or +1 die on rout checks for demonic battle groups, fearing the wielder more than her foes.
