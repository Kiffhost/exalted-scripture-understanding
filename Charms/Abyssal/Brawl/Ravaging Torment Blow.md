*The Abyssal preys on her maimed foe’s weakness, striking at already-broken bones and digging her fingers into open wounds.*
The Abyssal adds dice equal to her target’s wound penalty on the raw damage of a withering or decisive attack. If his wound penalty is increased above its base value, only ([[Essence]]) extra points count toward this.
While using [[Dark Messiah’s Wrath]], (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Strength]]) points of extra wound penalties count toward the Abyssal’s damage.
