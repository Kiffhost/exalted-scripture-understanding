Stormcaller’s wielder sheathes the blade with a whispered prayer, concentrating the fury of the storm into a single bolt of lightning that moves with her will. This takes the place of the normal consequences of sheathing Stormcaller. She makes an unblockable decisive attack against an enemy out to medium range, adding (Intensity x2) bonus damage. Once this Evocation has been used, it doesn’t reset until the wielder succeeds on a roll to purify Stormcaller under the new moon. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation. 

## Resonant

An Exalt who resonates with orichalcum may reset this Evocation by spending a scene in meditation with the bound demon, attempting to subdue it by force of will alone. She spends one Willpower, and rolls (Charisma + Presence) against difficulty 6. A success resets this Evocation; on a failure, she cannot attempt this again until she purifies the weapon under the new moon.
