Born from the accursed meat of cattle fed on human flesh and made infamous as a weapon of war by the Mask of Winters, puppeteer’s plague slowly seeps through the marrow of its victims, bringing their bones to accursed unlife within the bodies of their still-living hosts.
# Minor Symptom
The victim’s bones begin to stir with malicious intent. Insatiable itches seem to flare up along the bones of his limbs and spine, and he dreams of committing the most horrific atrocities. Each night, the victim must roll (Stamina + Resistance) at difficulty 3. On a failed roll, he cannot regain any Willpower from that night’s sleep. 
# Major Symptom
The victim’s skeleton begins to take on an unlife of its own, seizing control of his body to commit acts of sadism and wickedness. In addition to the above effects, whenever the Storyteller could inflict a botch on the victim from this disease, she may instead compel him to commit a physical action that is cruel or malevolent in nature—lashing out to strike an enemy in combat, stealing from a merchant, crushing a small animal beneath a boot heel. This urge can be resisted by spending a point of Willpower, but the character must enter a Decision Point to do so, drawing on a Major or stronger Intimacy. 
# Defining Symptom
The victim’s body houses an undead monster, constantly struggling to escape. This level functions as the major symptom, but now only defining Intimacies can be drawn on in a Decision Point to resist the evil impulses—which can now occur every scene in place of a botch. 
# Death
The victim’s skeleton wrests itself free from the constraints of muscle and nerve, killing him as it rips itself out of his body as a bonesider (p. 506).
