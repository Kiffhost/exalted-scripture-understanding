The Exalt infuses her familiar with Solar anima, unlocking the form of the sacred beast. Her familiar grows in size by 25%, and gains +1 to all Attributes, and both defenses. It also gains up to ([[Essence]]) mutations, determined by the player upon purchase of the Charm. The Exalt can choose to activate [[Saga Beast Virtue]] with as many or as few of the designated mutations as she chooses. While in Saga Beast form, the familiar is completely immune to fear-inducing effects.
