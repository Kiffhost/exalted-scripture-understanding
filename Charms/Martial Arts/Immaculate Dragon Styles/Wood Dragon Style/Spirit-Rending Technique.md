*Having placed her mark on a truculent god, the Immaculate rends its Essence apart from within.*
She adds (Willpower) dice to a decisive damage roll against a spirit marked by her Soul-Marking Style, and deals aggravated damage. If this incapacitates a spirit, the Immaculate gains (its Essence) motes.
