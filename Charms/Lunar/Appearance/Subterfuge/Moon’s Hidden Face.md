*The Lunar wears her humanity like a cloak over her ever-shifting divine monstrosity.*
One or more of her mutations gain the [[Subtlety]] Merit (Exalted, p. 166). She may optionally disguise a concealed feature as a garment or accessory while not in use, e.g., disguising [[Unusual Hide]] as a fur cloak. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Camouflage may learn this as a [[Manipulation]] Charm, with [[Inexplicable Mystery Incarnation]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
