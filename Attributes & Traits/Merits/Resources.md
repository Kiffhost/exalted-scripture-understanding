This Merit describes a character’s finances. Each dot represents an economic bracket and grants a standard income.
The source of this wealth must be detailed (rents on property, sharecropping, government stipend, banditry), since it may vary as the game plays out. Most Exalted have little difficulty accumulating some Resources if they wish, but it often makes the most sense when taken in concert with another Merit like Backing or Cult.
One dot indicates less than 1 shekel a year in jade, less than 64 koku a year in cash, or less than 60 dinars a year in silver—up to four times the expected income of a household with two skilled working adults (see “The Silver Standard,” p. 77). It’s appropriate to agrarian landlords, respected mortal craftsmen or artisans, renowned performers, successful small merchants, mid-ranking criminals in urban cartels, or local government officials.
Two dots indicates roughly a mina per year in jade, 128 koku in cash, or 100 dinars in silver—around twice the income provided by the previous level. It’s appropriate for urban slumlords, gang bosses, high-ranking local government officials, famous mortal artisans and performers, successful regional trade investors, or the stipend of a Realm patrician.
Three dots indicates a talent or less per year in jade; 8,000 koku in cash; or under 5 talents per year in silver—more than fifty times the income of the previous level. This level of Resources represents a take in the spoils of empire. It’s the income of the heads of established patrician houses, large cartels, or Guild merchant princes, and is also the usual discretionary stipend or income for Dynasts. These characters are usually economies unto themselves, with entourages who help manage their assets and depend on them for a living. Beyond three dots, it’s unusual for a fortune to be measured in cash—most of the independently wealthy bond their riches in silver or real or ledger jade.
Four dots indicates an income of 4-6 talents per year in jade; 16,000-50,000 koku per year in cash; or 20-30 talents per year in silver. Successful Dynasts and well-off patricians sometimes possess this level of Resources, as do successful Guild merchant princes, the most fortunate scavenger lords, rulers of small Threshold states, and mortal craftsmen with skills of singular value to the Chosen—for example, renowned mortal manse architects.
Five dots indicates an income of 12-20 talents per year in jade; 96,000-160,000 koku per year in cash; or 60-100 talents per year in silver. The heads of the richest patrician families, renowned and successful Dynasts (often serving vital positions within their Houses), established Guild factors, and the rulers of powerful Threshold kingdoms possess this level of personal wealth.

#### Dragon-Blooded
The typical Dynastic stipend is represented by Resources 3, with more successful or prominent Dynasts having Resources 4-5. If a Dynast has Resources 0-2, it might represent her being disfavored by her house or coming from an impoverished household, or might be the result of her falling into debt, making unwise investments, or living far beyond her means.

#### Sidereal
The typical starting salary is three-dot Resources; Sidereals can expect a quick promotion to four dots after a few successful missions. Lower ratings reflect sizable debts, disciplinary pay cuts, assets seizures incidental to auditing, poor money management, etc.
