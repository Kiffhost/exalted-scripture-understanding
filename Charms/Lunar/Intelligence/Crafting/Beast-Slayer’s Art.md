*The Lunar makes good use of slain prey.*
When using the remains of an animal, monster, or bestial spirit that she participated in slaying as an essential component of a major project using any Attribute, she gains (highest Mental Attribute) silver points, which must be spent toward an interval of that project. A project can only benefit from one slain beast, and each beast’s remains can only benefit one project.
