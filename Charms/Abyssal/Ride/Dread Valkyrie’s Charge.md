*The deathknight’s steed finds sure footing on even the most ephemeral paths, racing over mist and dark water.*
The Abyssal’s mount can traverse any surface, even non-solid ones: water, clouds, and even open gaps across chasms or shattered bridges. This doesn’t let it move vertically through the air. If this Charm’s duration ends while the Abyssal’s mount is somewhere it couldn’t normally stand, the deathknight must either use this Charm again or let the usual consequences of this ensue.
With a repurchase, the Abyssal may pay an four-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to let her mount move vertically in the air, as if on unseen wings, up to a maximum of long range above the ground. If she uses this Charm while on the ground, she can rise two range bands, rather than one, with a reflexive move action. Once airborne, this Charm’s base effect is sufficient to maintain her elevation — she need only pay the surcharge if she wishes to make further vertical movement. If she’s already airborne, the [[Willpower]] cost is waived.
