*Pinned by overwhelming force, the Bear stylist’s foe is helpless to fight back against her.*
On a successful grapple, the stylist waives Ursine Hide Endurance’s cost against a grappled foe. She gains [[Hardness]] equal to twice her current rounds of control against him, maximum ([[Essence]] + [[Stamina]] + [[Strength]]).
The attack roll penalty for being clinched subtracts successes instead of dice if he attacks her.
Once per scene, the stylist may evince **Invincible Predator Defiance**: After a grappled enemy makes a damage roll against her, she can pay one [[Willpower]] and expend all rounds of clinch control to subtract that many successes from the damage roll.
## Mastery
Invincible Predator Defiance doesn’t expend rounds of control.
## Terrestrial
The stylist can’t use Invincible Predator Defiance.
