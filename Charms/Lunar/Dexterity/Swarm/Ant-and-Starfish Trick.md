*Dividing her [[Essence]] among multiple bodies, the Lunar unfolds an aspect of her myriad selfhood.*
She may use [[Cunning Anglerfish Decoy]] for three motes and one [[Willpower]] to create a replica with full-fledged personhood and agency, immediately rolling for it to [[Join Battle]] if used in combat. It has the following traits: 
- It’s fully independent, capable of acting and making decisions for itself. If the Lunar creates a replica of a human form, it has her Attributes, Abilities, specialties, and Innate [[Merits]]. If she creates a replica of an animal form, it uses that animal’s traits except as noted below. She can’t create replicas of Legendary [[Size]] or Minuscule [[Size]] animals. 
- It has the Lunar’s [[Tell]], [[Willpower]], health track, and [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. It gains a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty toward the Lunar, which can’t be weakened or altered. 
- It can travel up to ([[Essence]]) miles from the Lunar before dissipating. 
- !!IthasEssence1,nomotepool,andcan’tshapeshiftor!! use [[Charms]], anima powers, spells, [[Evocations]], etc. 
- It carries functioning copies of any equipment the Lunar has, although artifacts are replaced by superficially identical but mundane equivalents. These dissolve if separated from the replica for more than a scene. 
- Observers can’t identify the replica as a duplicate with read intentions actions unless enhanced with magic or benefitting from superhuman senses. 
- The Lunar may touch a replica and end this Charm to absorb it into herself, gaining its memories. If she ends this Charm without doing so or a replica is killed, she doesn’t gain its memories. Replicas enhanced with this Charm count toward the maximum the Lunar can have, but don’t benefit from the discount for multiple activations.
