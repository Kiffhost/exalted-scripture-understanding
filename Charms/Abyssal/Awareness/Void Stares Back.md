*No mere darkness dares hinder Death’s Lawgiver.*
The Abyssal ignores penalties from poor lighting and darkness on vision-based [[Awareness]] rolls with any Ability.
While using [[Superior (Sense) Focus|Superior Sight Focus]], when the deathknight Joins Battle while in poor lighting, she adds bonus dice equal to the penalty these conditions inflict on other characters’ rolls.
