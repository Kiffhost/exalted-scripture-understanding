Only the Infernal is fit to judge the crimes she sees in the world. She selects the subject of one of her Ties who has been wronged in some way during the story and stops at nothing to punish those responsible for this crime. The punishment is elaborate, excessively harsh, and pleasingly ironic. The Infernal will go to any lengths to make sure the stage is set for her judgment to play out perfectly.

**Duration**: Session.
Iron Devil Judgment can be ended early if the Infernal harms the subject of her Tie in her schemes, or that she learns she has punished someone who is innocent.
