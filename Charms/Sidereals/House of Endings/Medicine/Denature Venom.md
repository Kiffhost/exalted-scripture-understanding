The Sidereal hastens the end of a venom’s potency, rendering it harmless. The Sidereal rolls to treat poison instantly and without needing any medicine or tools. Her successes are applied directly to lowering its duration, without needing to overcome its difficulty. Alternatively, the Sidereal can cleanse a patient’s system of toxins or drugs. This Charm can also be used to denature a poison or intoxicant with a touch (including touch its container), neutralizing its effect. Against magical poisons or intoxicants, she rolls (Strength + Medicine) against a difficulty set by the Storyteller.
