Though destiny may demand a life be cut short, the Sidereal may grant the dead the solace of seeing their final wishes fulfilled. When the Sidereal uses [[Obituary Composition Technique]] to discover a dead person’s unfinished business, she may take it on in their stead, committing the Charm’s cost indefinitely. She gains all of the deceased’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] relevant to his unfinished business, which can’t be weakened below Minor, and all his relevant memories. The Storyteller should reveal specific memories as they become important. The Sidereal may use them as a [[Lore]] background to introduce facts. When the Sidereal’s in a situation where she could make progress on the unfinished business, the Storyteller should tell her player, though not what she must do. Likewise, when she encounters someone relevant to the unfinished business, she learns that, but not how they’re relevant. This Charm ends when the Sidereal completes the unfinished business or it becomes impossible for her to do so; she can’t end it prematurely. She loses all [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] and memories conferred by it. If she was successful, she may summon the deceased’s ghost to seek repayment, as though binding a demon (Exalted, p. 473) without a roll. Alternatively, she may send him unto Lethe — with Rising Butterfly Prayer’s benefits if she knows it. This counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX). Especially powerful ghosts may require a roll to affect, though their unfinished business should be the most difficult part of affecting them. If the Sidereal fails to accomplish he deceased’s unfinished business, (current temporary [[Willpower]]) dice, losing one [[Willpower]] for each failed die and one [[Limit]] for each 10.
