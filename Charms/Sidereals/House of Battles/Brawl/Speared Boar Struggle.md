*The Sidereal leaves herself wide open, letting the momentum of a foe’s attack drive him into her clutches.*
The Sidereal may reduce her Evasion or Parry against an attack by up to (higher of Essence or 3), counterattacking with a damaging decisive attack or a grapple gambit. Each point she reduces her Defense by adds a non-Charm success to the attack, Initiative, and grapple control rolls and reduces the gambit’s Initiative cost by one. The Defense penalty can’t be negated.
