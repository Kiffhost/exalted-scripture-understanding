Anticipating how a fight will unfold in the blink of an eye, the Dragon-Blood directs her allies into advantageous positions and warns them of potential threats. After rolling [[Join Battle]], the Dragon-Blood may transfer up to (highest of [[Intelligence]], [[Wits]], or [[War]]) total points of [[Initiative]] to any number of allies, dividing up the transferred [[Initiative]] however she chooses. She canâ€™t crash herself this way. If she transfers [[Initiative]] to a Hearthmate, that character gains an additional point of [[Initiative]].
