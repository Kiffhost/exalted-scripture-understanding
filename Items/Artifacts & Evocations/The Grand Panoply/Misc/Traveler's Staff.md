This gnarled staff is an enchanted branch from an ancient tree found in a Greater Wood [[Manse]] located on the Blessed Isle. It can be used as a mundane [[Staff|quarterstaff]] in combat, but this is not its intended purpose, which is to provide food, firewood and shelter. At sunset, the user may plant the staff into the earth and commit three motes. The branch then grows into a fruit tree—usually apple—and sprouts enough wondrous fruit to feed the owner and several others for the evening. If she needs firewood, the owner can use the tree’s branches to provide it—wood gathered this way burns readily. Come morning, she can cut off a large branch to replace the original staff. The tree then dies and rapidly rots away. By sunset, no sign of its presence remains.
