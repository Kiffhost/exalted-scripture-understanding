*The deathknight’s calm and restraint conceal a roiling core of rage, ceaselessly gnawing at its fetters as it strains to break free.*
The Abyssal abandons all restraint, entering a berserk fury
- When she attacks, each 10 on the attack rolls adds one die of decisive or post-soak withering damage, maximum (Strength).
- She ignores wound penalties on attack rolls and influence rolls.
- She treats her wound penalty as one point higher if that’s advantageous for her. She can use her wound penalty in place of an enemy’s for Brawl Charms like Ravaging Torment Blow.
- Her Principles reflecting a positive outlook on death and Intimacies relevant to her motivation for fighting count as one step stronger. Defining Intimacies increase their Resolve bonus by one instead.
- She can’t withdraw, use social influence for purposes unrelated to combat, or cease fighting until all enemies are incapacitated or have fled.
She’s still capable of tactical thinking and intelligent decisions.
Ending this Charm prematurely crashes the Abyssal, setting her to Initiative –3 (if not already lower).
