*The deathknight draws sustenance from the anguished cries of the dying and the rich aroma of shed blood scent.*
When a battle group under the Abyssal’s command deals enough damage to empty an enemy battle group’s [[Magnitude track]], she can use this Charm to roll [[Join Battle]].
While using [[Called to Carnage]], the Abyssal can also use this Charm when her own attacks empty an enemy battle group’s [[Magnitude track]]. She must fight alongside an allied battle group to gain this benefit.
