*Standing at the center of attention, the Sidereal makes whatever party she attends a night to remember — or regret.*
As long as the Sidereal performs, her audience counts as having a Minor Principle of “I should throw caution to the wind and give in to the temptation.” Characters with Principles of asceticism, temperance, discipline, or self-restraint instead treat their intensity as one step lower. This Charm’s performance is incompatible with influence rolls.
