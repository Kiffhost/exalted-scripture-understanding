A breastplate with attached shoulder guards, this armor also includes a skirt that protects the character’s crotch and upper thighs, a pair of greaves to protect the lower legs and a pair of long bracer’s to protect the character’s forearms. The reinforced breastplate offers excellent protection to the areas it covers, but this protection is balanced by the fact that significant portions of the character are totally unarmored. The reinforced breastplate is the standard armor of the Realm’s heavy infantry.
