*Sensing the nascent potential of magical materials and exotic reagents, the Lunar understands how to draw forth their power to shape wonders.*
She undertakes a superior project with any Attribute at an accelerated pace. Artifacts require ([[Artifact]] – 1) months; the time to complete a manse is halved; mundane large-scale projects can be completed in no more than (10 – [[Essence]]) weeks. [[Artifact]] repairs take no more than ([[Artifact]] – 1) weeks. Each interval’s cost is reduced by (Essence/2, rounded up) gold points. This Charm is incapable of accelerating work on N/A artifacts or First Age artifice.
