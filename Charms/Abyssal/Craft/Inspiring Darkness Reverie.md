*Night brings renewed inspiration for the Abyssal, whether in the beauty of a quiet world or the vivid terror of her nightmares.*
Each night, at the stroke of midnight, the Abyssal gains ([[Essence]] + 2) silver points and one gold point for each [[Craft]] she has at 5. She doesn’t gain this bonus during downtime.
