The Dragon-Blood turns the strumming of her fingers on an erhu’s strings or the graceful steps of a dance into a facade for a deadly ambush, concluding her show with a truly breath-taking finale. To use this Charm, she must be in the middle of a performance. She rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Performance]]) with double 9s against the [[Resolve]] of a single target. On a successful roll, the Dragon-Blood, her allies, and her target roll [[Join Battle]]. Either the Exalt or one of her allies, designated before the [[Join Battle]] roll, has the opportunity to make an unexpected attack against the target (Exalted, p. 203). If the attacker beats the target’s [[Join Battle]], the attack is an ambush that bypasses defense completely; if not, it’s only a surprise attack, inflicting −2 [[Defense]]. [[Dance of Flashing Swords]] can be activated reflexively together with this Charm to disguise the sneak attack as part of the performance. If so, its [[Willpower]] cost is waived.
