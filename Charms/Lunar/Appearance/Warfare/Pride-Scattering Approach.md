As soldiers look upon the Lunar, they know she’s something beyond what they’ve trained to fight, a monster that will rip through their ranks and devour their hearts. What choice is there but to flee? This Charm can be used before the Lunar or an allied battle group attacks an enemy battle group that can see her, adding one success on the damage roll. If this causes a rout check, it’s at +1 difficulty; on failure, rally rolls to avoid dissolution take a −3 penalty. 
## Protean 

In shapes that most of the battle group’s members have a Major or Defining Tie of fear toward, 1s on the group’s rout check subtract successes. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
