The Dragon-Blood writes words to spark flames in her readersâ€™ hearts, incinerating all inhibitions in a swell of passion. She doubles 9s on a written inspire roll that creates anger, fear, lust, or another powerful passion. If she chooses to tailor her influence for a single reader only, he must enter a Decision Point and call upon a Major or Defining Intimacy to resist.
