*The Infernal is magnanimous in honouring her followers, accepting their admiration personally and feeding upon their awe.*

When someone makes a declaration of loyalty or love to the Infernal in person, she marks him as her own. He must make the pledge willingly, though not necessarily happily. Insincere promises are still binding, incidentally converting moles and double agents to loyal followers. Emerald flames brand the marked character with the Old Realm glyphs for *“Mandate of Heaven.”* He gains a Minor Tie of terrified awe toward her as the mark is burnt into place, and is intuitively aware that he’ll face harsh consequences for disobedience. The Infernal may choose to make the brand invisible, though it can still be seen with magic like [[All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight]].

The burning brand erupts into emerald flame if the marked character attacks the Infernal, uses a hostile effect against her, or makes an influence roll against her that her player finds disagreeable. It’s also triggered if he voluntarily weakens his Tie to the Infernal. The eruption deals (Infernal’s Charisma) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness.

If multiple characters pledge themselves to the Infernal simultaneously — for instance, in reciting a pledge of allegiance — she can use this Charm to mark a number of characters equivalent to a Size (Essence) battle group (Exalted, p. 206).

If a Penumbra Caste uses this Charm together with her oath-binding anima power, she waives this Charm’s Willpower cost.
