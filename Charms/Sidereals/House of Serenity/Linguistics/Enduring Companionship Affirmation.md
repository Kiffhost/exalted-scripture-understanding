The Sidereal’s words strengthen bonds of love, friendship, and mutual benefit, empowering them to withstand the test of time. When the Sidereal succeeds on a verbal or written instill roll to create or strengthen a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]], her target can’t willingly weaken that [[Intimacy]] and gains +1 [[Resolve]] against influence that would do so. This ends if the [[Intimacy|Tie]]’s object mistreats or offends her. Alternatively, when the Sidereal rolls to overturn influence (Exalted, p. 221) that opposes one of its target’s positive Ties, she waives the [[Willpower]] cost for both her and her target. Success reinforces that [[Intimacy|Tie]] as above. This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived when used on Ties of trust.
