*Shrieking in anticipation of horrors to come, [[Rattlebones]] unfolds and expands into an enormous, horrifying, contraption of jagged bone and soulsteel.*
To use this Evocation, Rattlebones’ wielder must have [[Osseous Arbalest Graft]] active. The crossbow grows to enormous size, gaining the following benefits:
 - It becomes a heavy weapon (DMG +14; OVW 5).
 - The wielder adds ([[Stamina]]) to the raw damage of withering attacks.
 - Rattlebones’ bulk grants the wielder light cover.
 - The wielder can pay a level of bashing damage in place of the [[Willpower]] cost of [[Flesh-Impaling Bone Spear]] and [[Sharp-Toothed [[Needle]] Spray]].
## Resonant
The wielder adds (Stamina/2) dice of damage on decisive attacks.
## Dissonant
The wielder must pay aggravated damage, not bashing damage, in lieu of Evocations’ [[Willpower]] costs 
## Special activation rules
This Evocation’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if the wielder uses it simultaneously with [[Osseous Arbalest Graft]].
