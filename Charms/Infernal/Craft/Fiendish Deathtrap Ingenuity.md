*The Infernal savours the fear of those caught in her elaborate death-traps, leaving them to die a slow, lingering death.*

The Infernal reveals that an enemy within medium range has stumbled into one of her traps, a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty (relevant Craft). Damaging traps have Damage (Essence)L, plus an additional die for each success the target failed by.

Snares, pit traps, and the like inflict the effects of being grappled on an enemy who fails his roll, with one round of control plus an additional round for each success he failed by. The Infernal can’t take the usual special grapple actions but doesn’t suffer any penalties. A trapped character or his ally can spend their entire turn to reduce the clinch’s rounds of control by two. Attacking or damaging the Infernal doesn’t subtract rounds of control.

If the Infernal has a relevant Craft, she gains three silver points if her target fails his roll. She gains (victim’s Essence) additional gold points if a nontrivial enemy is incapacitated by a damaging trap, or if a snared nontrivial enemy surrenders.

If the Infernal leaves a snared victim behind at the end of the scene to await whatever fate befalls him, she rolls (Essence) dice and loses that many Limit, maximum once per day.
