*The Sidereal evades the loss of a friend or ally by taking his wounds in his stead.*
When an enemy makes an attack against one of the Sidereal’s allies, the Sidereal can use this Charm to move instantly into close range of that ally and redirect the attack to herself before it’s rolled. This doesn’t count as her movement action. She can’t redirect undodgeable attacks unless she also uses [[Duck Fate]], nor can she redirect ambushes if the attacker would have also qualified to ambush her. If the Sidereal is protecting her target with [[Trouble Reduction Strategy]], this Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes.
