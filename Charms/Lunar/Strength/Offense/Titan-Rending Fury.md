*Incensed by her prey’s temerity, the Lunar meets his attack with all-destroying might.*
When a crashed enemy attacks her, she reflexively clashes with a withering attack. She automatically wins the clash, even if she rolls no successes. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. This Charm can only be used against a given enemy once per scene, unless he recovers from crash and is subsequently crashed again.
