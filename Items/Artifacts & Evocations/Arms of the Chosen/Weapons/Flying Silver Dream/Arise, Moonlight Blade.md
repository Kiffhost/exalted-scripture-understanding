*The Exalt’s anima flows into the sword, bringing it to life.*
The blade then leaps from her hand to do battle. [[Flying Silver Dream]] is rolled into battle independently, tracks its own [[Initiative]], and can perform combat actions appropriate to an animated sword. If it makes a decisive attack, it uses the lower of the wielder’s [[Initiative]] or its own to determine the raw damage of the attack. It flies freely in any direction, but can’t move farther than [[Range|short range]] from the Exalt, and if forcibly moved beyond that range will do nothing but attempt to return. The Exalt can call it back to her hand reflexively without ending the Evocation. [[Flying Silver Dream]] has no health levels. Decisive attacks deal [[Initiative]] damage to it, inflicting one additional level of automatic damage per four dice of damage rolled, rounding up. If crashed, the daiklave flies back to its wielder’s hand (or lands at her feet if she lacks a free hand), inactive but undamaged, ready to fight again with another activation of this Evocation. When reactivated in the same scene, waive the [[Willpower]] cost. 

## Dissonant

[[Flying Silver Dream]] loses one [[Initiative]] at the end of each of its turns. 

## Resonant

[[Flying Silver Dream]] can move out to [[Range|medium range]] while fighting independently. At [[Essence]] 4, this increases to [[Range|long range]].
