*The stylist surges toward and around her foe with uncanny, striking from odd directions before he realizes where she’s gone.*
When the stylist rushes an enemy with lower Initiative or opposes his disengage roll, she adds dice equal to the difference between their Initiative, maximum ([[Athletics]]). If she has a relevant [[Intimacy]] of primal emotion, she adds ([[Intimacy]]) to her effective [[Initiative]] for this Charm’s bonus.
If the stylist’s roll also beats her enemy’s [[Defense]], she creates an opening. The next time she attacks him before the end for the next round, if his [[Initiative]] is still lower than hers, she makes a [[Rules Reference/Combat/Stealth#Surprise Attack|surprise attack]], inflicting −2 [[Defense]].
