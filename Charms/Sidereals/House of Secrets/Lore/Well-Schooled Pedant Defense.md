*The Sidereal has no time for the foolish remarks of the ignorant and unlettered, waving away arguments beneath her notice.*
The Sidereal may cite a Lore background in a Decision Point as though it were a Major Intimacy. If it relates to one of her Defining Intimacies, it counts as Defining itself.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by gaining a new Lore background (typically by purchasing a Lore specialty).
