*The Dragon-Blood strikes a blow laden with Earth [[Essence]], magnifying the weight of whatever she strikes.*
She makes one of the following gambits:
**Weigh Down Weapons** (Difficulty 6): Earth [[Essence]] weighs down a weapon, increasing its weight a thousandfold for the rest of the scene. The wielder must reflexively roll a [[Strength]] 5 feat of strength against (the Exalt’s [[Essence]] + her [[Initiative]] roll threshold successes) or drop the weapon to the ground. Such a feat is also required to lift it or ready it. Even if the wielder does retain his hold on the weapon or later manage to lift it, all attack rolls with it take a −3 penalty, and carrying it while moving counts as difficult terrain. 
**Weigh Down Armor** (Difficulty 4): This gambit increases the mobility penalty of armor by −3, and requires the wielder to spend one [[Initiative]] in order to take any movement action. This penalty only lasts three rounds, but a subsequent use of this Charm allows a difficulty 5 gambit against the weighted armor that intensifies its weight until the wearer can no longer stand, forcing him prone and preventing him from taking any movement actions at all for the rest of the scene. He can free himself by removing the armor (Exalted, p. 591).
**Collapse Structure** (Difficulty 3+): The Dragon-Blood can collapse flimsy, weakened, or uneven structures, such as a poorly maintained bridge, a makeshift barricade, or an ancient statue. The difficulty is equal to the [[Strength]] minimum of the feat that would be necessary to destroy that structure (Exalted, p. 231), although the Dragon-Blood need not actually possess that much [[Strength]].
