In every word and action, the Solar manifests a core of magnificent integrity. Even the hearts of the wicked are filled with awe. Each time the Solar succeeds at social influence or successfully applies her Resolve, any witness who considers himself a follower of, subservient to, or less powerful than the Solar might be profoundly and forever changed in that moment. If the Solar’s action resonates with the character, he may accept an automatic Major Intimacy of respect for the Solar. On the back of this, he also gains a temporary boost of excellence on a scene of his choosing. During that scene, while acting toward a goal he wishes to fulfill, while using the Solar’s actions as a model, the character gains three bonus dice to all social influence rolls for the rest of the scene, and has his Resolve boosted by one.
