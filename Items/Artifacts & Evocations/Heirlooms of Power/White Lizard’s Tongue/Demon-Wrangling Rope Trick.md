*Once [[White Lizard’s Tongue]] is coiled around its wielder’s foe, its weight might as well be that of a mountain.*
When the wielder uses [[Master Herder’s Brand]], she may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge and raise the gambit’s difficulty to 5 to combine the effects of a grapple gambit with that Evocation’s gambit.
## Resonant
Instead of inflicting damage, each 10 on the [[Initiative]] roll adds an automatic success on the grapple control roll. This doesn’t cost the wielder [[Initiative]].
