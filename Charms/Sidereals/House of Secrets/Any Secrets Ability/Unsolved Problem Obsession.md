*Musing on what someone doesn’t know, the Sidereal wakes in him a burning need to find out.*
The Sidereal makes a special (Manipulation + Secrets Ability) instill roll against one character to draw his attention to something he doesn’t know that’s relevant to one of his Intimacies. She might play on a Tie of love by pointing out something he doesn’t know about his partner or present an intriguing puzzle to appeal to a Principle of intellectual curiosity.
If the Sidereal succeeds, her target gains a Minor Obsession (Exalted, p. 169) with learning that information. He suffers +1 target number on Willpower rolls to resist it. As long as he has the Obsession, any Resolve bonus from the chosen Intimacy is lowered by one. Should he subsequently learn the information, his Obsession shifts to whatever implications it has for his Intimacy.
The Obsession’s duration depends on the Intimacy the Sidereal plays on, lasting for (Intimacy) days. This resets if the victim fails a Willpower roll against the Obsession.
With a Secrets Ability 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to make her victim’s Obsession contagious. When he discusses it with others, he must make a (Manipulation + Secrets Ability) roll as above. He isn’t aware of doing so, although his player can enhance the roll with Charms.
Affected characters gain a Minor Obsession as above, and also gain the Intimacy that the Obsession is tied to, at Minor Intensity. The Obsession isn’t contagious for such characters.
