*The Primordials built Creation from the chaos of the Wyld. Tapping into this legacy, the Infernal gives form to the inchoate, birthing new worlds.*

The Infernal can use this Charm to shape the Wyld. She can only use it within the deep Wyld or in the outermost edges of the middlemarches. If she has [[Spirit of the Living World]] (p. XX), she can shape her inner realm like the deep Wyld, waiving this Charm’s Willpower cost.

The Infernal can shape an area that extends out to (Essence) miles from her, which can be increased further as described below. Shaping is an extended (Intelligence + Lore) shaping action with a one-minute interval, requiring a separate use of this Charm for each interval. The goal number depends on the effect the Infernal wishes to invoke. Once she reaches the goal number, she can continue the shaping with a new effect, resetting her successes to zero. The roll has a base difficulty of 5, subject to the following modifiers:

| Condition                | Difficulty Modifier |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Deep Wyld/Inner Realm    | −2                  |
| Middlemarch              | +2                  |
| Each roll past the first | +1                  |
The Infernal can make one of the following alterations once she reaches its goal number. Some require her to first lay groundwork with other alterations — most notably, increasing the range of her shaping.

- **Increase Range** (Goal Number 5): This Charm’s range increases to (Essence x 3) miles. A subsequent use increases this to (Essence x 5) miles, and a third use increases it to the maximum of (Essence x 20) miles. Increasing range must be done before any other shaping.
- **Create Land** (Goal Number 5): The Infernal transforms the Wyld into an island of Creation. It takes on a form suited to the surrounding Wyld, with suitable terrain, natural features, and resources determined by the Storyteller.
- **Reshape Land** (Goal Number 10): The Infernal resculpts shaped land, creating a new terrain feature and removing any existing terrain that’s incompatible with it. She can introduce natural resources, such as deposits of gold in a newly-shaped mountain. Particularly drastic changes might require several uses: if she wishes to create an ocean amid a blazing desert middlemarch, she might begin with an oasis, then a sea, and then expand it further with subsequent uses.
- **Demesnes** (Goal Number 20 or 30): After creating land, the Infernal may create a [[Demesne]] within it. This has a goal number of 20 for two-dot demesnes and 30 for four-dot demesnes.
- **Objects and Structures** (Goal Number 3, 10, or 20): After creating land, the Infernal can shape its natural resources into mundane objects or structures suited to the landscape she’s created. She could carve a fortified stronghold into a mountain or create weapons enough for an army from veins of iron. The goal number depends on the type of project that would be necessary to create the object: 3 for basic, 10 for major, and 20 for superior.
- **Denizens** (Goal Number 10 or 20): After creating land, the Infernal can shape inhabitants that are naturally suited to its terrain. At goal number 10. they must be comparable in power to humans or to natural animals that would be one- or two-dot [[Familiar]]s (Exalted, p. 161). At goal number 20, the Infernal can introduce beings comparable to three-dot [[Familiar]]s. She must create discrete groups of denizens, though not all need be of the same kind: a village of human-like creatures, the flora and fauna of a shaped forest, or a handful of territorial tyrant lizards scattered throughout the region.
- **Magical Materials** (Goal Number 30): After creating land, the Infernal can form natural deposits of magical materials within it, though she can’t create soulsteel. A single use of this produces enough materials to forge a single artifact weapon or armour. A second use expands this to enough for multiple such artifacts or larger artifacts like warstriders. These materials form within the land — the Infernal must still mine them before she can use them. Magical materials can’t be created within inner worlds.

The Infernal can continue shaping for as long as she can pay this Charm’s cost. The roll’s difficulty resets to its starting value each time she completes an alteration. She can act freely while shaping, including in combat, but can’t take other extended actions. This Charm ends prematurely if the Infernal fails a roll for it or is incapacitated.

Shaping the Wyld risks its denizens’ wrath. If the Infernal rolls six 1s in a single interval, the Storyteller may declare that a formidable threat is drawn to her, like a Fair Folk warband, or that she faces a “natural” peril of the Wyld’s chaotic landscape. Each interval, the number of 1s needed to trigger this is reduced by one, minimum (Infernal’s Essence). If the Infernal rolls more 1s than necessary, she may face even greater perils, like a Wyld-born behemoth, a Fair Folk of incredible power, or one of the hannya. This doesn’t apply in inner worlds.
