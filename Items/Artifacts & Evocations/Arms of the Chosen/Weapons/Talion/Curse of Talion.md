The Exalt lays her curse upon her adversary, dooming him to know the same suffering that he has caused. This is a difficulty 5 gambit usable only on an offender. It imposes a poetic doom of the Storyteller’s choice based on the curse spoken by the Exalt and the nature of the grievance, as though the offender had broken an oath sanctified with the Eclipse Caste anima power (Exalted, p. 176). An assassin might become the target of his employer’s other hired knives; a merchant who has turned a blind eye to the suffering of the poor might lose his eyesight. The wielder may remove the curse with a touch and a word. Way of 10,000 Indignations doesn’t let the wielder use Curse of Talion against enemies temporarily marked as offenders with it.
