Incandescent streamers of orange-white burning Essence swirl about the battlefield as the Solar swings Volcano Cutter around her, pulling the grinding Essence of the heaving earth in its wake. The Solar rolls (Dexterity + Melee), and then may shift any eruption points within six range bands of herself by up to two range bands in any direction. Characters caught beneath the new resting places of the eruption points must make a reflexive (Dexterity + Dodge) roll against the Solar’s successes to avoid the incoming eruption points—this counts as a disengage action, but may be taken even if the target has already moved. Caldera Reconfiguration Stance also allows the Solar to create one new eruption point with 0 Initiative, splitting it off from one of the other eruption points she’s relocating. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation may only be used when there are two or more eruption points on the battlefield. It can only be used once per scene.
