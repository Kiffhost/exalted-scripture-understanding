*No malady can lay low one who already mastered death.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses one of this Charm’s two defenses: VenomDrinking Thirst, against poison, or [[Plague]] Knows Its Master, against disease. She can use this Charm after a roll against the chosen ailment, rerolling ([[Stamina]]) dice that show failures. If this reroll lets her succeed against the disease, she gains one [[Willpower]].
The Abyssal can repurchase this Charm to learn the second defense.
