The Sidereal portends doom in Mars’ name, striking victories from the weave of fate. The Sidereal and her target make opposed ([[Strength]] + [Battles Ability]) rolls. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one [[Willpower]] for others. Success curses him, inflicting misfortune in a type of conflict named by the Sidereal. Once per scene, when he’s engaged in such a conflict, the Sidereal’s player may inflict +1 target number on an attack roll, [[Join Battle]] roll, [[War]] roll, or roll relevant to nonviolent conflict. She need not be present. Cursing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options. Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. Broken Peace Punishment (The [[Spear]]): The Sidereal’s target argues, competes, spars, or fights with her. Generous Soul Defeat (The Gauntlet): The Sidereals’ target shows mercy to an enemy, shares the spoils of a victory with someone who didn’t aid him, or forgives someone the Sidereal thinks doesn’t deserve it. Incompetent General’s Folly (The Quiver): The Sidereal’s target ignores advice he sought from her in matters of tactics or strategy, whether on or off the battlefield. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively. Insufficient Valor Curse (The [[Shield]]): The Sidereal’s target surrenders or flees from battle, backs down in an argument, or concedes or withdraws from another form of conflict. Reputation-Destroying Doom (The Banner): The Sidereal’s target boasts about his accomplishments. The Sidereal can curse multiple characters with this Charm.
