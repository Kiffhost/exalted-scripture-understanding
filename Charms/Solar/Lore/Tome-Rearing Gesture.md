With this Charm the Lawgiver may instantly shape from chaos a single copy of a book she has mentally written with [[Mind-Scribing Method]]. This can be done without a roll to create a tome with an average cover and simple font, though a ([[Wits]] + [[Lore]]) roll against a Storyteller-defined difficulty can change the cover’s material and design, give the book multiple lingual translations and a striking font, illustrations, color-edged pages and so on. This Charm does not require an activation of Wyld-Shaping Technique—the Solar is simply powerful enough to unleash the story in her mind upon the Wyld and shape it page by page. This does however require that she be in at least the bordermarches of chaos.
