*The Sidereal twines together the fates of those who share her path, foretelling the constellation under which they will reach their destination.*
As the Sidereal embarks on a journey, she can use an Ascending (Caste) Horoscope Charm on her traveling companions for ten motes, one [[Willpower]]. She must engage them in a social interaction, behavior, or ritual related to one of the constellations whose blessings she knows for that Charm. The Sidereal can use a Descending (Caste) Horoscope Charm instead or in addition to an Ascending Horoscope, at no cost increase. If a traveling companion harms another unprovoked or the Sidereal learns of one’s malevolent intentions toward another, he loses the blessing and suffers the Descending Horoscope. With an Any Journeys Ability 5, [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Sidereal can spend five days performing a constellation-themed ritual to use this effect on a vehicle of any size or on a road, bridge, heavenly canal, mountain pass, or similar route for one story. For the latter type of target, the Charm’s effect extends out to a day’s travel in all directions from where the Charm was used (not counting any travel magic). The chosen Horoscopes’ effects apply to all travelers on or within the route or vehicle.
