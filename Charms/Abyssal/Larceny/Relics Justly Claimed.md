*The deathknight’s elusive grasp claims wrests away her foe’s treasures, looting barrow-relics from their soon-to-be tomb.*
The Abyssal gains the following benefits when she uses [[Rapacious Wraith’s Grasp]]:
 - She can pay a three-mote surcharge to use it reflexively on her turn, without it counting for the attack for the round. She can only do so once per turn.
 - She doubles 9s on the [[Initiative]] roll.
 - If she succeeds on a disarm gambit against an enemy within close range, she can reflexively ready the weapon if she has a free hand. If it’s an artifact, she automatically breaks its former wielder’s attunement and can choose to attune it herself.
