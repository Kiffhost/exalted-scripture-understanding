*Ajelin has but one purpose: to kill.*
The wielder rerolls (Enmity) dice that show failures on a decisive damage roll. If she deals enough damage to increase a nontrivial enemy’s wound penalty, she gains motes equal to his new wound penalty. This can’t grant more motes than she spent on the attack.
## Resonant
This Evocation can be used after the damage roll.
