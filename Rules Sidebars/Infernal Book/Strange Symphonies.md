The [[Heart-Splaying Zither]] is one example of a wider class of demonic instruments, many with similar powers. Some resemble instruments found in Creation, like trumpets, drums, and sanxians. Others take forms long forgotten by mortals or entirely unique to Hell, like silver-flecked sandpipes that howl with the Endless Desert’s winds or a fleshy harp that sweetly screams as its strings are plucked. The simplest way to reflect these is to change the kind of Intimacy that the instrument reveals, based on the materials used in its construction — the preening, golden wood of Vitalius might reveal ones based in pride or insecurity, while a conch-horn from the Demon Sea reveals love and betrayal.
