If the Lunar determines that the spirit has no intention of providing aid — potentially by reading his intentions — she may intercede in his stead. If she accomplishes the desired goal, and at least a majority of the spirit’s worshipers recognize this, she strips away the spirit’s divine authority. He loses his Cult rating, and she gains it. If his Essence equals or exceeds the Lunar’s, he instead loses one dot of Cult, which she gains, bringing her up to a maximum of his original Cult rating.
