*Gorgon’s roused hunger unleashes a tide of blood sufficient to sate its thirst.*
The Exalt may activate this Evocation to add (Wakefulness) dice to a decisive attack’s damage. 

## Resonant

If the enhanced attack incapacitates a non-trivial enemy while at Wakefulness 1+, Gorgon’s Wakefulness rises by one.
