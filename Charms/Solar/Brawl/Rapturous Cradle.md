Lifting her hand, the Solar reaches across the shroud of the heavens to find the one she has marked. Pulling on a brand created by Burning Proof of Authority, she may draw a captive into her grasp from as far away as long range. The target does not travel the distance between himself and the Lawgiver, but blurs into her steel embrace as if he had never left it. Using Rapturous Cradle automatically releases the Solarâ€™s commitment to Burning Proof of Authority, removing the brand and resuming its effects in total.
