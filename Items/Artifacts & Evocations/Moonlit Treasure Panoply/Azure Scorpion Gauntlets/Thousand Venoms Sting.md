Smiling Yathe manifests within the wielder’s anima banner, his stinger dripping venomous [[Essence]] that coats the gauntlets’ blades as the wielder strikes.
The wielder makes a decisive attack, inflicting a poison with Damage 1L/round, Duration ([[Essence]] + [[Strength]]) rounds, and a –2 penalty. The enemy’s onslaught penalty subtracts successes from his roll against the poison, maximum ([[Strength]]). This includes the onslaught penalty inflicted by the wielder’s attack.
A Lunar with [[Adder Fang Method]] (Lunars, p. 258) can use it to enhance this poison, gaining that Charm’s Protean benefit.
## Resonant
The poison’s damage rolls double 10s, and double 9s against crashed enemies.
## Dissonant
The poison’s duration is ([[Strength]]).
