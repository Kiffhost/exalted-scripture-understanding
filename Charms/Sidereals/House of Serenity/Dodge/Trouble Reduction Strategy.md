Spotting impending danger to an ally, the Sidereal convinces fate she’s dodged it on his behalf. The Sidereal reflexively takes a defend other action using Evasion instead of Parry. Her protection lasts for this Charm’s duration, but the ward must remain within close range to receive it. This Charm ends if the Sidereal uses a defend other action on another character.
