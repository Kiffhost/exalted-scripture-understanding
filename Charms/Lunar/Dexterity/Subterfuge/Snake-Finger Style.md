*The Lunar’s fingers move with supreme precision and fluidity, dipping in and out of a merchant’s pocket or teasing a lock’s tumblers open from inside.*
She doubles 9s on a roll to pickpocket a character, pick a lock, disable a trap, cheat at cards or dice, poison a drink, or similar actions. She suffers no penalties or increased difficulty from lacking equipment.
