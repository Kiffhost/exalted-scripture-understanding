The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s mien gives pause to even the most ferocious predators, proving to them that she deserves their respect. She doubles 9s on a roll to train an animal (Exalted, p. 554) or to influence it using Performance or Presence. Even if she uses this Charm to scare off a dangerous predator, her noble bearing causes the beast to regard her with respect. Over the course of weeks, she can claim such an animal as her familiar. This takes a number of weeks equal to (its Resolve), and the Dragon-Blood must successfully interact with it using this Charm at least once each week. Once this is done, that animal becomes her familiar at no experience cost.
