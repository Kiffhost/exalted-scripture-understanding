As the vizier’s subtle ways force an opening in her enemy’s guard, her shadow fingers strike like her closed fist. When the stylist succeeds on a disengage, read intentions, or influence roll against a nontrivial enemy or successfully asserts her Guile or Resolve against one, she may use this Charm to have a shadow finger reflexive make a withering or decisive attack against him.

This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round.
