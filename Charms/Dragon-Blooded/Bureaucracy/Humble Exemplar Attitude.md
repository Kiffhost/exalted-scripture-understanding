She undertakes a project (Exalted, p. 226)orbureaucratictaskthatupholdsoneofherDefining Principles, adding ([[Essence]]) non-Charm bonus dice on all [[Bureaucracy]] rolls that she makes as part of the task. Once the project begins, the Dragon-Blood’s [[Intimacy|Principle]] becomes apparent to all members of the organization as though they’d read her intentions.
