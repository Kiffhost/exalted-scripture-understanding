The victorious general demoralizes his enemyâ€™s forces before the battle begins. Perhaps their supply lines have been ravaged and they must fight hungry; perhaps vengeful ghosts have been sent to haunt their camps. In any event, the enemy takes a -1 penalty on all [[Rout]] checks and all [[Rules Reference/Combat/Battle Groups/Command|Command]] actions.
