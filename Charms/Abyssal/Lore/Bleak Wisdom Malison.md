*Confronting the weak with their frailties and follies, the Abyssal teaches the wisdom of despair.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Fatal Flaw Scrutiny]] to reveal a weakness in someone’s agenda she can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to confront him with the futility of his actions . If her successes equal or exceed his [[Resolve]], he suffers a –(Abyssal’s [[Essence]]/2, rounded up) penalty on mental and social rolls related to his agenda, and 1s subtract successes. This lasts until the Abyssal uses [[Fatal Flaw Scrutiny]] on another character or until that character spends three [[Willpower]] to resist.
