The sword exhales a cold wind of forgetfulness. Whenever the wielder uses a Simple or Reflexive-type Charm that creates a decisive attack, she may create a memory-excising gambit instead, adding one automatic success to the attack and [[Initiative]] rolls. If she does so using [[Iron Raptor Technique]], [[Sandstorm-Wind Attack]], or [[Blazing Solar Bolt]] (Exalted, pp. 350, 353), reduce the cost by two motes.
