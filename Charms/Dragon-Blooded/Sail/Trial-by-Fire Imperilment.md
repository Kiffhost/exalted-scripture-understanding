*The ocean boils as the Dragon-Blood’s ship rains fire down on enemy fleets.*
She adds (Anima) dice on a broadside stratagem and deals an additional level of damage if she succeeds. This Charm lets the Dragon-Blood attempt a broadside even if her vessel lacks anti-ship weaponry or crew to man it — she might cast a spray of embers to set an enemy ship’s sails afire, set part of its hull ablaze with a bolt of fire, or lend a spark to the firedust in her enemy’s cannons.
This Charm can only be used once per scene unless reset by gaining 3+ Momentum from a successful [[positioning]] stratagem.
