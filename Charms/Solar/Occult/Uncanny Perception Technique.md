*The Solar’s senses are preternaturally attuned to the movements of spirits and other uncanny beings.*
Whenever a spirit or Fair Folk is within the range of the Exalt’s senses, she experiences a strange sensory phenomena; she might hear bells tinkling, smell a particularly strong or unusual scent, or taste something resonant. The Solar gains half her Occult (rounded up) in successes to an Awareness-based attempt to notice such a being. The warning signaled by this Charm occurs even when a spirit is immaterial, allowing the Solar to use [[Spirit-Detecting Glance]].
