The Lawgiver’s mount brooks no challenge to its authority, for it carries the sun on its back. After using Seasoned Beast-Rider’s Approach to Join Battle, the Solar’s mount gains one Initiative per turn. In addition, when the mount succeeds at a Ride-based movement action or gains more successes than its opponent in an interval of a race, the mount gains Initiative equal to the Solar’s Essence. At Essence 4+, the mount’s base Initiative value is set to 4 or its Stamina, whichever is higher, to a maximum of 6.
