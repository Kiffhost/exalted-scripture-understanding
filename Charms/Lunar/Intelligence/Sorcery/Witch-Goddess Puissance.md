*The Lunar witch invokes forces both within and without, drawing on bestial [[Essence]] and places of ancient power to work her wonders.*
When the Lunar undertakes a sorcerous working of a Circle she’s initiated into, she gains the following benefits:  - She negates the first botch the working suffers.
 - Animal shapes that thematically support a working count as complementary Ability Means (Exalted, p. 487). The Storyteller may increase their terminus bonus to +2 if the Lunar has a significant number of relevant [[Charms]] or other supernatural powers. Workings that might benefit from this include creating chimerical animal hybrids, cursing someone with an animal species’ enmity, or blessings similar to one of an animal’s natural strengths or cultural significance.
 - Territories whose properties thematically support a working (Lunars, p. 176) count as sorcerous infrastructure Means for workings performed within them, as do demesnes and manses with relevant geomantic aspects or other qualities.
The terminus bonus increases to +2 if the Lunar has a significant number of [[Charms]] or other supernatural powers that enhance territories.
 - If her Solar mate provides Means for the working — either as a cooperating sorcerer or by offering a complementary Ability — he adds an additional +1 to the working’s terminus.
