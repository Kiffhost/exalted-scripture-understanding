*The Abyssal pens a missive that is not merely comprehensible, but actively antithetical to understanding.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Linguistics]]) [[influence roll]] to compose a message to a single target. His [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] don’t modify his [[Resolve]] against this influence. If successful, he loses the capacity to understand or communicate in any language. However, he can understand [[Infinite Blasphemy Glossolalia]]’s anti-language as if he were a [[creatures of darkness|creature of darkness]].
This influence costs (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) to resist, instantly restoring knowledge of all lost languages.
Otherwise, it lasts until this Charm ends. Mortals, [[Essence]] 1 ghosts, and trivial characters can’t resist.
A repurchase reduces this Charm’s mote cost by the intensity of the target’s strongest [[Intimacy]] based on fear or antipathy toward social interactions or belief in the meaninglessness of things. It also lets the Abyssal convey this Psyche effect through spoken influence.
