As the Sun remains Unconquered, so too do those who awaken this armor’s power of aegis. On the Lawgiver’s turn, she may use the third Evocation of the Brilliant Sentinel against foes who are currently under the effects of the prerequisite. She draws on the illuminating power of the Brilliant Sentinel, causing herself to glow like a multi-colored glass mosaic, eating the light that burns in their eyes, twisting and distorting their vision so that she is the only thing they can perceive. Foes who have not yet acted that round cannot see nor attack anyone but the Solar. Exalted foes may break free of this effect by paying one Willpower and applying their Resolve against the Solar’s Charisma + Presence.
