*The Dragon-Blood draws a foe off guard with lithe, suggestive motions, taking advantage of his wavering attention to unleash a deadly barrage of [[Needle|needles]] or other concealed weapons from her hair, fingertips, or the back of her throat.*
On her turn, she may force an enemy with lower [[Initiative]] within short range to roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against her [[Guile]]. If he fails, she reflexively makes an unexpected decisive attack against him with ([[Manipulation]] + successes by which the enemy failed) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesnâ€™t include her [[Initiative]] or reset her to base. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully establishing concealment against all enemies with a [[Stealth]] roll.
