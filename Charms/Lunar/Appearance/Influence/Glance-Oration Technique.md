*Through perfect control of her body and demeanor, the Lunar is capable of great expressiveness even without speech.*
She uses body language to convey an [[influence roll]] or a single sentence, ignoring the [[Resolve]] bonus for using body language (Exalted, p. 221). She can convey far more than usual through body language, though highly abstract concepts or complicated technical information remain beyond her.
