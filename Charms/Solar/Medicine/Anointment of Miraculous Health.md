Where the Exaltâ€™s Essence-charged hands go, shattered bones are made whole and torn flesh is instantly mended. With each use of this Charm, the Solar can convert (Essence) aggravated damage to bashing or lethal, or she can cure the same number of lethal or bashing health levels. This Charm can be used once per scene, but can be reset by a two point stunt to treat a patient, so long as it does not involve Anointment of Miraculous Health.
