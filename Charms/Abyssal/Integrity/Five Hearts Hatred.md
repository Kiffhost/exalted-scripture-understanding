*Even specters tremble at the viciousness that seethes within the Abyssal’s soul.*
Against influence that would weaken one of the Abyssal’s negative Intimacies, up to (Essence) 1s subtract successes from the roll against her (but not other targets). If the targeted Intimacy is Defining, the Abyssal can wait until after the influence roll to use this Charm.
## Reset
An Intimacy can only be protected this way once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal that upholds it.
