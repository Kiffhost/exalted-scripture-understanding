*The Abyssal’s blade arcs through the air like cruel lightning, leaving behind severed limbs and bloody stumps.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after landing a decisive attack, before the damage roll. If her victim doesn’t commit to accepting the highest level of crippling injury possible (Exalted, p. 201) in advance, the Abyssal adds (Strength) dice of damage and rolls an additional die for every 9 and 10 on the damage roll.
She gains one Willpower if this incapacitates him or he accepts a crippling injury.
If the enemy takes a crippling injury, it doesn’t count against his once-per-story limit on doing so, and he’s immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene.
This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived against trivial opponents, and the deathknight can choose what crippling injuries they suffer rather than their player.
However, the Abyssal can’t gain Willpower from maiming such foes.
