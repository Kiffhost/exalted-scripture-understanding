*With a flourish, Everlasting Descent’s wielder releases captured debris from its orbit to launch it hurtling toward her foes.*
The wielder makes a withering or decisive attack with flung debris against an enemy within medium range. Its range increases to medium with Spin 3+. This counts as an attack made with [[Everlasting Descent]], including for compatibility with [[Martial Arts]]. It may gain tags based on what the wielder flings, like Piercing for a pitchfork or Smashing for a pile of bricks, etc. The range from which she can gather debris is the same as with [[Whirling Ecliptic Barrier]]. While [[Whirling Ecliptic Barrier]] is active, a withering attack adds (Spin) dice of decisive damage or postsoak withering damage. 
## Resonant
The wielder doesn’t need Spin to attack at medium range. With Spin 3+, she can attack at long range.
