*The ocean’s depths embrace the Infernal as their rightful queen, nourishing her with their supplication.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits while underwater:
- She ignores (Sail/2, rounded up) points of penalties from fatigue and deprivation.
- She always counts as resting for regaining motes (Exalted, pp. 173-174).
- She doubles the rate at which she heals damage (Exalted, p. 173). The multiplier increases to (Sail) when healing her Incapacitated level.
- She can meditate instead of sleeping and need only do so for (8 − Essence) hours for a full night’s rest.
## [[Keys]]
#### Rising Tide Ascension (Sail 4, Essence 2)
Once per day, the Infernal can spend an hour praying to herself while underwater to roll (Charisma + {Performance, Presence, or Sail}) with (Essence) automatic successes. She gains motes equals to her successes. If she gains at least five motes, she also gains one Willpower and forms a positive Minor Tie toward herself, or strengthens an existing Tie by one.
#### Benthic Depths Rebirth (Sail 5, Rising Tide Ascension)
The Infernal only needs one hour of underwater meditation instead of sleep. Once per day, she may reset all of her other once-per-day Charms after doing so.
#### Primordial Ocean-Goddess Orison ([[#Benthic Depths Rebirth (Sail 5, Rising Tide Ascension)|Benthic Depths Rebirth]])
Once per day, the Infernal can gain the benefit of a full night’s sleep with just a few seconds of underwater meditation. She can also use this key to complete [[#Rising Tide Ascension (Sail 4, Essence 2)|Rising Tide Ascension]]’s prayer with just a few words of self-adulation, or combine the two effects.
#### Eternal Tehom Embodiment (Essence 4, [[#Benthic Depths Rebirth (Sail 5, Rising Tide Ascension)|Benthic Depths Rebirth]])
The Infernal heals one level of damage for every hour she spends meditating underwater. If she’s incapacitated while underwater, she revives at the end of the scene, healing her Incapacitated level, as long as she isn’t already dead.
