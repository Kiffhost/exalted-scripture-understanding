# Imperial Organs
## [[The All-Seeing Eye]]
The Realm's central spy network.
## The Deliberative
Officially: The Deliberative Senate of Exceedingly Judicious Nobles
Modeled on the power structures of the First Age, the parliament of the [[Scarlet Dynasty|Realm]] was originally a concession to discontented Dynasts after the Empress' third and final failed attempt to annex the Scavenger Lands (see [[Timeline of Creation]]). It is formed of a **[[#Greater Chamber]]** of [[#Dynasts|dynastic]] **Senators** and a **[[#Lesser Chamber]]** of mostly [[#Patricians|patrician]] **delegates**. With the Empress in place as sole potentate, it had no real power but to counter-balance the influence of [[#The Thousand Scales]], and to suggest laws for the Empress' edict. 
### Greater Chamber
Appointments to the Greater Chamber are made by the Empress, and cannot be refused, a tool the Empress has long used to keep an eye on her most troublesome descendants (for most of them are Dragon-Blooded). Legislation is proposed by Senators in a process ripe for filibustering, and sent to the Lesser Chamber via a simple majority vote. 
### Lesser Chamber
Delegates are appointed by the Greater Chamber, but may only be dismissed by the Empress. Legislation cannot be introduced at this stage, but the Lesser Chamber may choose to vote down bills passed to it from the Greater. Should it accede, the Empress then holds final veto or may sign it into law.
## The Thousand Scales
There is no official name for the hundreds of interwoven ministries that provide the structure and guidance the sprawling Realm sorely needs. Nonetheless they are so interwoven and similar in ruthlessness and corruption that they are often treated as one bureaucratic entity. If that entity had a heart, it would be found in the Imperial City, as most ministerial headquarters are built as near as possible to the Imperial Palace. Many ministries have branches all across the Realm, though, building local hubs as appropriate to serve their function.

The countless bureaucrats that serve the many ministries broadly belong to the [[#Patricians|patrician class]], though some [[#Peasants|peasants]] gifted in a useful field may also be employed. It is these patricians that give the rest their reputation as scheming mandarins, with some patrician family names as entrenched here as Dynastic houses in [[#The Deliberative]]. Their nepotistic politicking even extends so far as to make it near impossible for an unExalted Dynast to rise through the ministerial ranks, a situation almost unique among Imperial power structures.
#### Nine Rigorous Examinations
Acting as the key filter for entry to the Thousand Scales, these twice-annual examinations are as much a test of logistics, finances, and social ability as intelligence and intellect. Candidates must travel to the appropriate location, pay a test fee and likely hire a tutor, and, should they pass, receive a recommendation from inside one of the ministries. As such, [[#Peasants]], and poorer [[#Patricians]] struggle to enter the Thousand Scales, at least without owing something to someone.

Once past this initial hurdle, almost every small career advancement requires further competency exams, with the exception of appointments made to replace an unexpected vacancy (hence the high rate of assassinations among the ministries). The highest ranks are further filtered through approval from [[#The Deliberative]]. 
### Imperial Treasury
In charge of facilitating the actual storage of jade in treasure-manses, the ledgers upon which those hoards truly live and validating all expenditure by any other ministry, it is no wonder the Imperial Treasury is such a powerful ministry within the Thousand Scales. Nevertheless, it is entirely reliant on other ministries, especially the [[#Humble and Honest Assessors of the Imperial Tax]] for income. 

Since the Empress' absence, rampant corruption has reduced this income to barely a tenth of what it was, squeezing one of the true lynchpins of the Imperial Service.
#### Bank of the Scarlet Throne
The sub-ministry under which loans are made to merchants and [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]] alike.
#### Bursars of the Imperial Tribute
The vaults and storage of silver talents taken from the threshold. The [[#Imperial Treasury]] is empowered to promise these away in ledgers (usually to pay foreign mercenaries), but only the Bursars can actually move the silver itself.
### Imperial Purse
Officially: Empress' Private Purse
A smaller institution than the [[#Imperial Treasury]], the Imperial Purse deals with the flow and storage of cash. This ministry is often overlooked by na√Øve Dragon-Blooded, but legionnaires are paid in cash, and much of the legal commerce of the Realm relies on a stable currency and huge paper-loans. 
### Humble and Honest Assessors of the Imperial Tax
A.K.A: The Assessors
Responsible for both calculation and collection of Imperial Tax, notably this is separate from local tax levied and collected by the [[#Prefects]], a situation which does nothing to improve the Assessor's abysmal reputation with nearly everyone with something to take. Their collectors have been combat-trained as a matter of course for the whole history of the Realm. Villages, businesses and wealthy households are typically taxes as a whole, and thus punished as a whole when the tithe is not met. For villages in particular, the sentence is [[#Dispossessed|Dispossession]].

In many cases the Assessors have been forced to refrain from taking tax altogether to avoid complete economic destruction of a prefecture. An especially difficult decision as the [[#Imperial Treasury]] they supply must sign off on any and all expenses the Assessors face.

[[#The All-Seeing Eye]] used to work hard to root out any corruption in the Assessors, but since the Empress' disappearance it has has other priorities and the temptation (or the threats of [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]] and Prefects) is proving too much for more Assessors by the day.
### Imperial Courts
Officially: Righteous and Implacable Courts of Imperial Justice
Most prefectures have an Imperial Court in their capital, and these courts oversee both criminal and civil justice. Charging crimes, and the majority of actual enforcement of their judgements is down to the [[#Guardians of the Realm]], a much easier organisation to sway, especially at the rural and local level. Cases against [[#Dynasts]], [[#Outcastes]] and in some cases [[#Patricians]] are taken to the **Empress' Own Court** in the Imperial City, with a triumvirate of senior respected judges (many of whom belong to House Peleps). 

Professional lawyers are near non-existent in the Realm, with judges themselves acting as prosecutor and defendants expected to provide their own defence. These judges must stay within the bounds of Imperial Law, with a range of pre-determined judgments for common crimes ranging from fines, beatings and brandings to [[#Slaves|enslavement]], [[#Dispossessed|dispossession]], exile, and execution.

The only higher authority likely to intervene in any given case is [[#The Magistracy]], who have full authority to overturn any judges ruling as they see fit. Judges are themselves recruited from experienced ministers, or else from the Spiral Academy and the Outer Coil. They are appointed by [[#The Deliberative]], an honour for the judge but usually perfunctory within that body, though that is changing since the Empress' disappearance.
### Honourable and Humble Caretakers
Officially: Honourable and Humble Caretakers of the Common Folk
AKA: Home Office
The Caretakers are the check and balance for the [[#Prefects]], with duties especially toward protecting the citizenry of the Blessed Isle (even if just to ensure crop yields remain stable).
#### Guardians of the Realm
AKA: Black Helms
More usually called Black-Helms, these constables are empowered to enforce the law as they see fit on [[#Peasants]], and always work in pairs at the least. Guardians receive a small salary (through the [[#Honourable and Humble Caretakers of the Common Folk|Home Office]], which is also responsible for coordinating them), but typically take on law enforcement to supplement a separate primary income.

Guardian officers, exclusive found in cities are empowered to punish [[#Patricians]] and mortal [[#Dynasts]]. When unable or unwilling to make a judgement themselves, black-helms bring offenders before [[#Imperial Courts]]. In the case of Dragon-Blooded misdeeds, black-helms will report to [[#The Imperial Force]], only intervene if absolutely necessary, and may only hold a Terrestrial for a maximum of three days.

Black-helms may also act as a magistrate's bailiffs, required by law to obey their orders. They each wear a brass belt-buckle with an engraved pentagram as their official symbol of office, and an open-face conical black helmet as their practical one.
#### The Imperial Force
The Dragon-handlers earn their inauspicious moniker as the only organisation with the authority to arrest an Exalted Dynast. Each member is directly appointed by the [[#The Deliberative]]'s Greater Chamber, one of the highest honours the Realm can award a mortal. Some are Exalted, and all are fiercely loyal, reporting directly to the Deliberative. Their symbol of office is a polished silver buckle inlayed with a red jade pentagram.
### Knowledgeable Advisors
Officially: Wise and Knowledgeable Advisors of Foreign Tributaries
AKA: Foreign Office
Also called the Foreign Office, this is the ministry which (bureaucratically) contains each satrap and all of their advisors. The Knowledgeable Advisors provide recommendations for security, and coordinate between distant satraps and central military might. With the Empress' disappearance and subsequent lack of unity, this advice is almost never followed, with satraps considering only their loyalty to their House.
### Stewards of Imperial Assets
AKA: Stewards
Closely linked to the [[#Honourable and Humble Caretakers of the Common Folk|Home Office]], this is the ministry responsible for maintaining all public structures, from local sanitation and highways to the [[#Infallible Conveyors of Official Messages and Heartfelt Expressions|Imperial Post]]'s Heliograph towers. One of their most important responsibilities is the Realm Defence Grid, and in the instability since the Empress' disappearance, its maintenance has become the Stewards' sole focus.
### The Imperial Post
Officially: Infallible Conveyors of Official Messages and Heartfelt Expressions
An extensive and efficient network of couriers reaching beyond the Blessed Isle to many satrapies. Sophisticated and efficient Heliograph towers used for the most important (and least confidential) messages of the [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]], the Deliberative and occasionally individual Dynasts. A cadre of sorcerers sworn to confidentiality.
### Curators of the Imperial Registry
The Imperial Registry describes and delineates the powers, edicts and judgements of every branch of government. Disputes between ministries ultimately end here, with an interpreter hearing arguments and making a binding judgement within 10 days. The punishments for corruption among the Curators, or those who would bribe or blackmail them are among the most severe in Imperial law.
### Sagacious and Scrupulous Registrars of Sorcerous Puissance
Maintains the (White) registry of every sorcerer in the Realm. This ministry naturally has close ties to the [[Heptagram]], for administrative and surveillance reasons. Every sorcerer in the Realm owes a single formal *Obligation* that the Empress or [[#The Deliberative]] can theoretically invoke at any time for no cost, typically such Obligations are kept under extreme secrecy, and the Empress was known to tailor Obligations carefully, humbling or empowering sorcerers as she saw fit. 
#### White Registry
While not officially public, the White Registry containing "every sorcerer in the realm" is realistically known to every Realm organisation with any espionage capabilities. As such such sorcerers are treated as known quantities, and young aspirants of the Heptagram and elsewhere must make a choice early on, to be included and this somewhat insulated from espionage work, or to use their unregistered status to cash in on valuable but dangerous employment.
### Illustrious Compilers of the Perfected Curriculum
A.K.A: Illustrious Compilers
Responsible both for the curriculum and running of Primary Schools, and for funding every Secondary School except The Cloister of Wisdom (funded by the Immaculate Order) and the Heptagram (Independent).
### Diligent Monitors of the Diffusion of Divine Essence
A.K.A: Diligent Monitors 
Tracks the ancestry of all [[#Dynasts]], [[#Outcastes]], and [[#Patricians]], including births, deaths and marriages. Also responsible for licensing mons for dynastic and patrician households.
### Splendid and Just Arbiters of Purpose
Responsible for finding, gathering, and taking care of any newly awakened Dragon-Blooded who do not belong to the [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]]. These "lost eggs" are almost all from the [[#Peasants|peasant]], [[#Slaves|slave]] and [[#Dispossessed|dispossessed]] populations, and so must be re-educated about their place in the world, taught etiquette and customs and then (as [[#Outcastes]]) allowed to make their choice between the coin and razor. Exalted [[#Patricians]] sometimes fall under the Just Arbiter's care, though most are close enough to the [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]] for their family to strike a deal for their adoption or marriage.
### Fastidious Keepers of the Imperial Peace
Responsible for regulating travel and travel permits and inspecting ships for contraband. An ideal ministry for those looking to take bribes, and disappointing to those wanting to influence Dynastic politics.
### Ministry of Prehistoric Recollection and Antiquities
Responsible for securing volatile relics and secreting them where only Scarlet [[#Dynasts]] can see. Also plays a role in censorship, especially as it relates to histories from [[Timeline of Creation|before the Empress' Reign]].
### Devoted Wardens of the Empress' Wilderness
The Empress owns all land in the Realm, and this ministry manages any of that land that isn't leased out to [[#Patricians]] or [[#Dynasts]]. 
### Righteous and Accountable Ministry of Weights and Measures
Aside from standardising measurement and inspecting merchant scales, this ministry surveys properties for taxation, as well as land and border disputes, validates [[#Imperial Treasury|Treasury]] mints, [[#Bursars of the Imperial Tribute|Bursars]]' silver purity and [[#Empress' Private Purse|the Purse]]'s paper quality. Corruption is exceedingly high in this ministry.
## The Magistracy
The Magistrates are a group of Dragon-Blooded selected by (and drawing their legal power and protection directly from) the Empress herself, usually from those who were entirely reliant on Her for redemption, rebels, heretics, political scapegoats, social outcasts, and even criminals. Magistrates are forbidden from accruing wealth, but all citizens of the Realm are required to make available anything a Magistrate needs, from food to [[Artifact]]s. As such, they are nearly impossible to bribe, and have every legal and practical protection necessary to root out corruption, especially in [[#The Thousand Scales]], over which they supposedly have ultimate authority. The only crime they can be found guilty of is treason, and can hold anyone less than a House Matriarch to account as they see fit.

Magistrates are the one branch of government with the full and genuine support of nearly all the common populace. Treated as Princes of Earth from the moment they are appointed, they benefit from the near fanatical worship of the Empress as her visible hands. Savvy Dynasts seek to benefit second-hand from this adoration by their own respect and courtesy to the Magistrates.

Once appointed, a Magistrate receives a personal scribe and undergoes a loose master-apprentice training regime with a more senior Magistrate. They are expected to return to the Imperial City every five years, where their deeds and judgements are measured, and new assignments made. Magistrates may also accrue mortal servants called Archons, selected by them in a similar manner to their selection by the Empress. Archons must willingly enter service, and do not do so lightly, as they become their Magistrate's full servant, required to do anything she asks, and, when a Magistrate dies, their Archons die with them.
# Local Government
Typically, the Empress ensured that each prefecture's local government was split between several [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]]. If not via rotating appointments of politicians, then by encouraging business relevant to a different house.

Satrapies are...

While the leadership of a prefecture belongs to the [[#Prefects]] and [[#Governors]], [[#Patricians|patricians]] often staff their offices and hold significant political sway. Similarly [[#The Immaculate Order]] with its network of monks is usually closer to the local [[#Peasants|peasantry]] than any Dynastic prefect could hope to be.
## Prefects
Prefects are appointed directly by [[Hierarchy of the Realm#The Deliberative|The Deliberative]], always [[#Dynasts]], though only the most significant (and rewarding) prefectures end up with Exalted Dynasts.

Prefects are responsible for appointing rural tax collectors, and face an evaluation at least every seven years. These reviews largely centre on profit, if too little tax is collected (whether from laxness or unrest), the Prefect will lose her contract. These reviews and appointments are also sometimes used to punish or reward [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]], a favoured tactic of the Empress.

It is possible that this seven year cycle is what lead to the Council of the Empty Throne deciding on their secret deadline. Seven years after her disappearance is enough time to be certain that every local government loyal to the Empress can be replaced or vetted for their stance on the [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]]' manoeuvrings.
## Governors
In turn, Prefects appoint **Governors** for the cities and towns of their prefecture, typically from the [[#Patricians]] class, though large cities may be governed by a mortal Dynast or Outcaste. They are responsible for coordinating local [[#Guardians of the Realm|Guardians]], and collecting taxes.
## Satraps
# Other Powers in the Realm
## [[The Immaculate Order]]
## [[The Imperial Legions]]
# Perfected Hierarchy
## Dynasts
Members of the great houses, those who Exalt are second to none and rule by divine favour. They alone may hold many key positions of power and privilege, or indeed, they may not, as many such Exalted choose not to become gainfully employed, who is there to stop them?

Those who remain mortal are still a cut above even the wealthiest patrician, and usually high in the Deliberative, Thousand Scales, or satrapies.

Members of the cadet houses lack many of the social opportunities afforded to their cousins on the Blessed Isle, especially those relating to education. Nonetheless they are full Dynasts, and carry all the legal weight of such a lofty title wherever the Realm holds sway.
### Outcastes
Exalted dragon-blood of no known lineage are still considered holy by the Immaculate Order, and thus, once tested in an Imperial Secondary School (assuming they survive) and after having taken either the razor or the coin, they may join a Great House through a marriage, or found a small house of their own.
## Patricians
Effectively an administrative class, the patricians see to much of the day-to-day practicalities of the Realm. 

Legally, they are able to serve in any capacity a mortal [[#Dynasts|dynast]] might, though they may struggle to reach the highest of such climbs. Patricians may even traffic in artefacts of the Realm Before or the First Age, providing they have a license with [[#The Thousand Scales]], and pay the associated heavy taxes.
## Common folk
### Peasants
The bulk of imperial population. Peasants have rights which are protected by Imperial courts, though Dynasts may execute them without trial for high crimes (just not too often).

Though many peasants are farmers or other labourers, merchants also fall under this class, with the richest being significantly wealthier than the poorest [[#Patricians]]. They still lose out in legal rights, however, as they are not permitted to own artefacts, must bear a permit and pay a fee to cross a prefecture border by land, and live under the thumb of the [[#Black-helms]].
### Slaves
Usually foreigners, citizens native to the blessed isle can only be enslaved as a punishment handed from an Imperial judge. Slaves may own property, and their children are considered [[#Peasants]] (a shrewd House Cynis policy to maintain their monopoly), but they have no other rights unless granted them by their master, harm to a slave is considered property damage.

Only Dynasts may own slaves, and they may only free one a year (the Deliberative instituted this as a roadblock to abolitionism).
### Dispossessed
The dispossessed are vagabonds, runaways, criminals, escaped slaves and those unfortunate mortals caught in the Realm's bureaucratic or legal crossfire. They have no rights, and anyone may do with them as they wish under the law. Dispossession is most commonly encountered as a punishment handed down from Imperial judges, (occasionally en masse). Those convicted in this way have an X branded on their forehead. A sentence of dispossession can be revoked by a sympathetic judge, or by the Empress' Imperial decree.

Children of the dispossessed do not inherit their parent's plight, being considered [[#Peasants]]. Though unless they find some way to escape, they are likely to live with their kin in circumstances just as difficult.

Notably, it has long been illegal to press the dispossessed into [[#Slaves|slavery]], though House Cynis and others are fighting to change this since the Empress' disappearance.
