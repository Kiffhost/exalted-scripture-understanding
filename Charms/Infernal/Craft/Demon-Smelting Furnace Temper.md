*The Infernal dissolves a demon into its very Essence to suffuse her artifice with its fiendish might.*

The Infernal executes a demon as she begins a superior project to create an artifact, permanently destroying it and applying the gold point discount from [[Glory-Forging Sacrifice]] on all rolls she makes for the project. She chooses up to (Essence) of the demon’s Eclipse Charms and imbues the artifact with them as [[Evocations]], in addition to its own. They don’t count toward the limit on how many [[Evocations]] the artifact can have. The Infernal can spend white points as if they were experience to awaken these Eclipse Charms.
## [[Keys]]
#### Anvil-Altar Sacrament
The Infernal can use this Charm on any supernatural being with Eclipse Charms.
