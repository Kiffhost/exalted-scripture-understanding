The Infernal was born to reign, not to serve. She seeks to supplant the leadership of the most powerful organization in her vicinity, stopping at nothing to take her rightful place as ruler by the most expedient means, including murder, intimidation and blackmail. If she is already a subordinate in an organization, she will prioritize taking over that one.

**Duration**: Session. 
Crown-Seizing Conceit can be ended prematurely if the Infernal's efforts cause her to lose power within the organization or disrupts her future plans for it.
