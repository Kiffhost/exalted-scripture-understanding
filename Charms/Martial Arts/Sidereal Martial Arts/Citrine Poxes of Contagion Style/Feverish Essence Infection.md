The martial artist has learned ten thousand subtle principles of infection and ten thousand ways in which each of them might be used. Upon purchasing this Charm, the stylist chooses a supernatural disease — one of the diseases presented with this style, puppeteer’s plague (Exalted, p. 235), cracked mirror blight (Arms of the Chosen, p. 61), or others. The Storyteller can veto disproportionately powerful diseases like the Great Contagion. The sacred diseases of the Three Supreme Plagues — drunken moth sickness, jigsaw organ condition, and white sun fever — are so closely entwined with this style’s Essence that any stylist can master them. For other ailments, the stylist must first encounter the disease — either directly or through close interaction with a victim. When the stylist uses this Charm, she makes a difficulty 3 gambit. Success exposes her victim to the disease. Mortals and trivial characters don’t receive a roll against it. Others suffer infection even if their roll succeeds but automatically succeed on their first roll against the disease’s morbidity. This Charm can be repurchased any number of times, each adding a new disease to the stylist’s repertoire. Enlightenment: The stylist may make a damaging decisive attack instead of a gambit, inflicting the disease if she deals 3+ levels of damage.
