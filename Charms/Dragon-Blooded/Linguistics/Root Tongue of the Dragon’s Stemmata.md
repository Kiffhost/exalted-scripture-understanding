Immersing herself in the shared lineage that unites the Terrestrial host, the Exalt transcends all boundaries of language that would divide her from her kinsfolk. Her spoken words can be understood by any Dragon-Blood, regardless of language, and she may likewise understand them. She can also read anything written by another Dragon-Blood in any language, although her own writings aren’t translated for other Dragon-Blooded. Her keen affinity for the psyche of her Terrestrial kin lets her reroll 1s on rolls to read the intentions of Dragon-Blooded or break ciphers created by Dragon-Blooded.
A scene spent using this Charm to communicate with a Dragon-Blood speaking an unknown tongue can substitute for the (6 – Intelligence) days of study needed to use Language-Learning Ritual for that language.
