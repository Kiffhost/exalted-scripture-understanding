*The stylist slows time’s flow, trapping her enemy a half-step behind her in eternity’s gyre.*
The stylist makes a decisive attack against a lower-Initiative enemy. If its damage equals or exceeds (target’s Integrity or Resistance), he suffers the following effects: 
- Acting on his turn requires him to flurry to take a single action. He can still take actions that couldn’t normally be flurried, like using Simple Charms. 
- All of his movement counts as being through difficult terrain. 
- His onslaught penalty doesn’t refresh at the start of his turn — instead, it’s reduced by one. This effect ends at the end of the scene or if the target crashes or incapacitates the stylist.
## Enlightenment
The target’s onslaught penalty doesn’t decrease on his turn.
