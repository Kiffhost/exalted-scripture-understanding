*The Infernal makes her heart a featureless thing, letting observers project their expectations upon her.*

The Infernal gains +2 Guile if any of the following conditions are true:
- She has a positive Tie toward the opposing character, or vice versa.
- She has a negative Tie toward the opposing character, or vice versa.
- She hasn’t taken any overt and obvious actions this scene, like yelling loudly, making an influence roll, attacking someone, or using visible supernatural powers.
- She’s already succeeded on an influence roll or read intentions roll against the target or successfully asserted her Guile against him this session.
## [[Keys]]
#### Shattered Self Fragments (Socialize 3)
This Charm’s Guile bonus is increased by one and is non-Charm if at least two conditions are met — or one condition, with [[#Broken Mirror Visage (Socialize 5, Essence 2)|Broken Mirror Visage]].
#### Broken Mirror Visage (Socialize 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal always gains this Charm’s Guile bonus. However, if she willingly reveals one of her Defining Intimacies to someone — whether through words or unmistakable actions — she rolls Limit dice as if she had violated that Intimacy (p. XX), unless that character has the same Intimacy.
