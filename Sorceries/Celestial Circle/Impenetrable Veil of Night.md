*A twisting nexus of living shadows takes form between the sorcererâ€™s hands.*
As she completes the spell, she casts the umbral tangle upward, where it expands into a column of ebon darkness centered on the sorcerer that extends out one mile in horizontal diameter and immeasurably high vertically. Within the [[Impenetrable Veil of Night]], torches, lanterns, and even anima banners cast light out only to half their usual range, while speech and noises echo in strange, unnatural ways. Even characters with supernatural senses capable of seeing in mundane darkness still suffer a -2 penalty on all [[Awareness]] or Perceptionbased rolls made within the veil. A battle group that is caught within the darkness immediately makes a rout check at +1 difficulty. A sorcerer who knows [[Impenetrable Veil of Night]] as her control spell speaks with a distorted voice, as if she were always standing within the nihil of the spell. Light subtly flees her body. She gains three bonus dice on [[Stealth]] rolls made to stay hidden while moving in combat at night or in shadowy environs, but loses the same amount of dice in broad daylight while in open spaces. She also gains a +2 bonus to movement actions made at night, !!buta-2penaltytomovementactionsmadeinopendaylight.!! Distortion (Goal Number: 15): Distorting the veil causes the darkness to part around the sorcerer, out to medium range from her, for up to an hour.
