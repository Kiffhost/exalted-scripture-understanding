*Let none make excuses by claiming they cannot hear their master’s commands.*

The Infernal’s voice can be heard clearly out to (Essence + Charisma) range bands, negating distance-based penalties and environmental penalties on influence rolls. However, she can only be so quiet — even if she whispers, it’s as loud as her normal speaking voice. If the Infernal’s crown from [[Crowned With Fury]] is visible, it can be seen out to the same range that it can be heard at.

The Infernal adds (Essence) non-Charm dice on spoken persuade and threaten rolls with any Ability to issue orders or make demands, and on other influence the Storyteller deems suitably similar. However, she wishes to make any other influence roll, she must pay one Willpower, letting her do so normally for that scene.

If the Infernal makes a threaten roll against a single enemy in combat, he’s stunned if she beats his Resolve. He loses (Infernal’s Essence) Initiative and suffers a −1 crippling penalty until they take a miscellaneous action to clear their heads. Characters with superhuman or magically-enhanced hearing lose an additional point of Initiative and can’t clear the penalty, suffering it until the end of the scene.
