*The Ebon Shadow moves in flashes, evading an enemy’s attack without seeming to ever cross through space.*
[[Elusive Flicker Evasion]] forces an enemy to make two attacks rolls for a decisive attack against the martial artist, taking the lower result. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood may only use this Charm once per scene, though it can be reset by incapacitating a non-trivial opponent with an unexpected decisive attack. 
## Mastery
When an enemy misses the martial artist, he loses points of [[Initiative]] equal to the difference between the two attack rolls, up to a maximum of the martial artist’s [[Stealth]].
