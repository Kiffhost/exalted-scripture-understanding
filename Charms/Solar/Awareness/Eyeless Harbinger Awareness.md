The Solar’s sense of touch is attuned to movement in the world around her. When a hidden character attempts to move across a surface connected to one the Solar is touching, he accrues an additional -2 penalty to his Stealth roll, in addition to the regular -3 penalty detailed on page 204. This Charm functions within short range of the Solar. She can touch a tree trunk and feel something moving in the lowest branches, sense footsteps approaching her in a pitch black hallway, and other, similar feats. If the target is within range of the Solar’s extended touch upon rolling Join Battle, the Exalt gains three non-Charm dice to her Join Battle roll so long as she cannot see her opponent. If the Exalt has learned Unsurpassed Hearing and Touch Discipline, she can feel such movements out to medium range, and can determine the size, shape, and velocity of her target. She can feel a siaka circling beneath her ship, and she can differentiate between a gecko or an assassin lizard climbing down a wall she’s leaning against.
