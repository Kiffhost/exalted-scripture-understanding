*Radiant Brushstrokes Flourish Some lessons can only be learned by doing.*
This Evocation upgrades [[Cloud-Wreathed Scholar]] (Miracles of the [[Solar Exalted]], p. 16). Once per scene, the Solar may use it to [[Introducing a Fact|introduce a fact]] in the middle of combat even if she’s introduced a fact previously during the scene. She doesn’t need to be advancing her Circle’s or an ally’s goals to gain this benefit. She may reset this Evocation by successfully [[introducing a fact]] and making a decisive attack on the same turn using [[Filling Blank Pages]].
