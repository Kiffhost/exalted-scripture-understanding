This Charm creates a unique magical stratagem with threshold 3 to infiltrate an enemy’s ranks with a traitor in combat. To use it, the Dragon-Blood must already have at least a +1 bonus to her Strategic Maneuver roll from spies or traitors in the enemy’s ranks. Success lets her reflexively !!revealthepresenceofherloyaldoubleagentwithinabattle!! !!groupatanypointduringthecombatthestratagemapplies!! to. The Storyteller may rule some betrayals impossible, or require a stunt in which the Dragon-Blood describes how the infiltration occurred. Battle groups with [[Might]] 2+ or !!perfectmoraleareimmunetoinfiltrationviathisstratagem.!! Once she’s declared the betrayal, the battle group suffers automatic rout, as its most notable or highest-ranking member is revealed to be loyal to the Dragon-Blood. If this character is narratively significant on his own and his defection would defy suspension of disbelief, the Storyteller may declare that another member is the traitor instead. If an opposing commander is able to successfully rally the battle group, he !!preservesasingledotofthatbattlegroup’sSizeforeverytwo!! !!successesontheroll.Therestaresubtractedfromthegroup!! and rolled into battle as a splinter faction loyal to the traitor. !!Ifthebattlegroupisn’trallied,thentheentireforcegoesover!! with the traitor, reforming on its next turn.
