*The Infernal's fury burns hot, boiling over in billows of coruscating nightmare-steam.*

As the Infernal makes a decisive attack, she's filled with a wild rage, as if she'd been affected by an inspire roll. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on the attack roll and one die on the damage roll. If she deals damage, her target is scalded by nightmare-steam, increasing his wound penalty to his Resolve by one for the rest of the scene.

If the Infernal is already enraged when she uses this Charm, she adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on the damage roll instead. If she deals 3+ damage, the wound penalty inflicted applies to all the target's rolls and static values, not just his Resolve. This applies whether her rage is the result of a prior use of this Charm, roleplaying, social influence, or Charms like Retribution Will Follow (p. XX).
