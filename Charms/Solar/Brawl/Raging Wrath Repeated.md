The Solarâ€™s surging, destructive Essence is redoubled when she breaks an opponent with her own hands. If the Solar crashes an opponent she is clinching, she may reflexively activate this Charm, resetting her combat action, and restoring all the rounds of control that she had at the start of the clinch.
