*By sorting through possessions, physical evidence and so on left by a particular person, the Exalt may construct a psychological profile of the character who left the evidence.*
This Charm allows the Lawgiver to profile a character who is not even present, at a difficulty based on the dissonance of the scene. If the character has left little or misleading evidence of himself behind, the difficulty is raised. However, extra successes on the Exalt’s ([[Perception]] + [[Investigation]]) roll allow her to disregard inconsistent evidence at a rate of one success per one erroneous item eliminated. The Exalt may continue to use this Charm until she has the clearest picture possible, ignoring the [[Willpower]] cost on additional uses, however, this requires that there be material for her to continue sorting through. Once her investigation is completed, the Storyteller informs the player of the Exalt’s overall success. If she has accurately profiled the character, then she will automatically notice any and all characters who meet that profile, or scenes of events which fit that character’s profile, through the use of [[Watchman’s Infallible Eye]].
