The blood of the Dragons is precious beyond measure, manifesting the vitality of a lineage that reaches back to the dawn of time. Slicing a palm to pour out a draught of her own blood, the Dragon-Blood confers this undying vigor on her patient. She doubles 7s on a roll to provide medical treatment. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) through medical skill or expertise, such as successfully treating a plague-ridden city or saving the life of a sibling stricken with a supernatural malady.
