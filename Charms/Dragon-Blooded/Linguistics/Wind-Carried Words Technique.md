The Dragon-Blood speaks into the wind, sending her voice afar on subtle currents of air. She may send a spoken message of no more than a few sentences to a chosen target within ([[Essence]]) miles. Messages sent with this Charm cannot be overheard or intercepted by any mundane means. Magical attempts to do so must overcome a difficulty of (the Dragon-Blood’s [[Essence]] + [[Linguistics]]). This Charm’s range extends to ([[Essence]] x5) miles at [[Linguistics]] 3, and ([[Essence]] x10) miles at [[Linguistics]] 5. With [[Linguistics]] 5, [[Essence]] 4, the Terrestrial may pay one [[Willpower]] to extend it to ([[Essence]] x100) miles.
