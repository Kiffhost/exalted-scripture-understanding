Ajelin makes violence second nature to its wielder, sharpening their instincts and speeding their sword-hand.
The wielder reflexively makes a decisive attack against an enemy whose [[Initiative]] is lower than (her [[Initiative]] + Enmity). She can always attack crashed enemies.
An enemy damaged by the attack is caught off guard by the wielder’s deadly speed. In the next round, he can’t take his turn until the tick after the wielder, regardless of his actual [[Initiative]].
This Evocation’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if the wielder uses it simultaneously with [[Accursed Blade Embodiment]].
## Resonant
The wielder doubles her Enmity when determining if she can use this Evocation against an enemy.
## Dissonant
A successful attack can’t delay its target’s turn by more than (Enmity) ticks.

## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy whose [[Initiative]] was higher than the wielder’s. She can’t reset it if she’s crashed.
