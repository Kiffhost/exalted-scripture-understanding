*Such is the Infernal’s mercy that she might spare those who stir her to wrath, offering them a chance to prove their loyalty.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after a decisive damage roll that would deal 3+ levels of damage. She forgoes dealing any damage, instead unleashing a flash of emerald flame that brands her victim. The brand is invisible, though characters using magic like [[All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight]] can see it: the Old Realm glyphs for *“Mandate of Heaven,”* written in green flame.

The branded character immediately forms a Tie of terrified awe to the Infernal, and intuitively understands that he will suffer his wrath if he opposes her. The brand erupts into emerald flame he attacks her, uses a hostile effect against her, or makes an influence roll against her that her player finds disagreeable. The branded character immediately suffers all of the postponed damage, which can’t be avoided in any way. The Infernal doesn’t need to be aware of the branded character’s disloyalty.

This Charm’s cost is waived if the Infernal uses it together with [[Green Sun Nimbus Flare]]. The dice added by that Charm are converted to automatic successes to determine the damage stored in the brand.
