Creation itself shudders as the Lunar casts off the veil of humanity concealing the primal monstrosity coiling at the core of her [[Essence]]. Characters with Major or Defining Ties of fear toward her double those [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]’ [[Resolve]] penalties against the Lunar’s threaten rolls with any Attribute (including written influence) and must pay an additional point of [[Willpower]] to resist them. The increased penalty also applies when these Ties lower the characters’ [[Resolve]] against fear-based [[Charms]] that compare the Lunar’s [[Appearance]] to their [[Resolve]]. The characters can’t voluntarily erode these Ties unless they successfully harm the Lunar or cause her to suffer a notable setback or defeat. [[Influence]] rolls to weaken these Ties fail automatically unless supported by evidence of such a setback or defeat. Affected characters also suffer nightmares of the Lunar, and must succeed on a ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) roll at difficulty (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) each time they sleep to regain [[Willpower]] from rest. While using this Charm, the Lunar may use [[Perfect Fear Scent]] for three motes, and [[Divine Terror Avatar]] for two motes and two [[Initiative]]. Protean: In a shape that a character has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward, the Lunar applies this Charm’s effects against that character while he can see her.
