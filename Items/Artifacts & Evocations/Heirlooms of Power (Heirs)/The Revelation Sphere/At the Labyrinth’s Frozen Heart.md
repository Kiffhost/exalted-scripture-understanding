## Resonant
Only characters resonant with the Revelation Sphere can awaken this Evocation.
As the wielder deftly twists the Revelation Sphere to solve its puzzle, the orichalcum bands locked around it slide and retract, their bindings no longer fettering the dreaming power that lies within. The runes etched on its surface drift into the air as shimmering patterns of azure light, surrounding her with ancient words of power. She gains the following benefits:
 - Any successes she adds on [[Shape Sorcery]] rolls or spell effect rolls with [[A Dream of Ancient Ice]] are non-Charm.
 - When she casts a spell enhanced by [[A Dream of Ancient Ice]], its [[Willpower]] cost is reduced by one. This applies regardless of whether she enhanced a [[Shape Sorcery]] roll or a spell effect roll, or whether she added successes or spent them in place of motes.
 - At the end of each of her turns, if she succeeded on a [[Shape Sorcery]] roll or cast a spell, she gains one [[Initiative]].
 - She doubles 9s on spell effect rolls for spells that enhance her senses, scry on distant things, or divine the past or future.
 - While shaping a spell, the runes grant [[Hardness]] ([[Perception]] + [Integrity, [[Lore]], or Occult]).
A Dragon-Blooded Amilar scion whoâ€™s awakened this Evocation can use the Revelation Sphere as a Means for sorcerous workings that involves enhancing her senses, scrying, or revealing the past or future, adding +2 terminus. Other wielders may gain access to this benefit with a repurchase of this Evocation.
