The Solarâ€™s unerring ear and perfectly tuned voice allows her to flawlessly mimic the normal speaking voice of someone she is familiar with. For this mimicry to be flawless, she must spend at least an hour memorizing the speech patterns and vocal inflections of the character whose voice she wishes to copy. This Charm supplements a single social influence action or regular dialogue lasting no more than ten seconds.
