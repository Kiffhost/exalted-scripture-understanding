The Lunar conceals her voice within the mutterings of a crowd. She can use Innocuous Rumormonger Remark for one mote and one Willpower while within close range of multiple characters to conceal her statement’s source. Onlookers perceive it as being a general sentiment expressed by the crowd she’s in — even those in the crowd can’t discern who said it. If the Lunar knows Voice-Hurling Method, she can use this Charm while within short range of multiple characters.
