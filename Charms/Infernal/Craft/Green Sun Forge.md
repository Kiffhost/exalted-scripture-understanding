*The Green Sun Prince is a peer to Hell’s greatest artificers, equal both in glory and terror.*

When the Infernal begins a project to create an artifact, she treats its level as one dot lower to determine how long the project takes, the goal number, and any effects that benefit from the lower rating. For two-dot artifacts, projects require one week and have a goal number of 10. This is compatible with N/A artifacts: they count as five-dot artifacts and only require a [[Superior Project|superior project]], but the craft point cost must still be paid with white points.

However, such mastery is not without price. The Infernal’s player and the Storyteller should work together to determine a cost to be paid by the Infernal or whomever the artifact is made for, akin to those asked by Ligier (p. XX). The severity of this varies with the artifact’s rating: a two-dot artifact’s price may be merely unpleasant, while an N/A artifact demands life-altering consequences. She can still complete the project if the price isn’t paid, but the resulting artifact will bear a curse that falls upon its wielder or a potentially crucial imperfection.
