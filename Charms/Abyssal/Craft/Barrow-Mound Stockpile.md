*Prolific in her dark craft, the Abyssal artisan is rarely found empty-handed.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Ceaseless Wicked Toil]] while facing a significant challenge, she can pay a sevenmote surcharge to reveal more dramatic contingency and preparation, as long as it could be completed with a single major project (Exalted, p. 239-240). Examples include a strategic cache of ammunition, a canoe concealed by a lakeside, a lavish banquet awaiting unexpected visitors, etc.
If this preparation’s larger than the Abyssal could carry on her person, her player declares a nearby location where it’s stashed. She can’t reveal something that would solve the challenge outright.
If successful, the Abyssal is awarded as per a major project. If she fails, she still receives the rewards of a basic project with the flawed item.
