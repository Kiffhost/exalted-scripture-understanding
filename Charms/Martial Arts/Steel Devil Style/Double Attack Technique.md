*Moving with deceptive speed and feinting strikes, the Exalt slashes with one blade and strikes with another.*
This Charm creates a normal withering attack that has a chance to land an additional second strike. On a hit, if the threshold successes meet or exceed the target’s Defense, this is treated as landing a second attack. If both attacks land, however, only a single damage pool is created and a single damage roll is made. On a successful double attack, add (the Exalt’s Dexterity + [Charge/2, rounded down]) to the attack’s base damage. Note that both attacks incur onslaught penalties (p. 194)—a strike against a Parry of 5 would only need to generate four extra successes to penetrate the resulting rating of Parry 4. Likewise, the successes used landing the second attack are not calculated as extra successes when determining damage. 
## Terrestrial
When used by a Terrestrial, this Charm’s base damage is increased by (2 + [Charge/2, rounded down]).
