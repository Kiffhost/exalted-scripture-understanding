*Death’s Lawgiver condemns her foes to the depths of mortal despair, filling them with a drowning dread.*
The Abyssal makes a special ({Appearance, [[Charisma]], or Manipulation} + [[Sail]]) inspire roll to spread sorrow, despair, or fear. Affected characters begin drowning (Exalted, p. 232), even if they don’t normally need to breathe, coughing up putrid brine and seaweed. Characters with [[Exalted Healing]] fall unconscious rather than dying if they run out of breath. Mortals killed by this always return as ghosts, who have Defining Ties of fear towards the Abyssal.
This influence costs (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3) [[Willpower]] to resist, but this cost falls by one for each round that passes, minimum one [[Willpower]]. Exalted and other supernatural characters may roll ([[Stamina]] [Resistance) opposing the Abyssal’s initial roll on their turn to reduce the cost by an additional [[Willpower]]. This action can’t be flurried.
## Reset
