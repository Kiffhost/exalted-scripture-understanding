## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by a character resonant with jade. 

Activating this Evocation requires that the wielder be at Initiative 15+ and both hearthstone sockets be filled. The Exalt vanishes for a moment behind an expanding sphere of wind and debris shot through by lances of blue light. This disperses to reveal a towering dragon of blue jade — a synthesis of the wearer and the dragon on the armor. This fusion uses most of the wearer’s normal traits, but replaces herhealthtrackanddicepoolswiththoseofalesserelemental dragon, as well as gaining access to its Charms — even those that lack the Eclipse keyword — and the Legendary Size and Soaring Dragon Flight merits. For actions that have no listed dice pool, she rolls (Essence − 1) dice instead. She still uses her base traits for determining her maximum dice from Charms and any other Charm calculations. Any items that are incompatible with her draconic form, such as armor or weapons, vanish into Elsewhere for the duration, but she can still use the Evocations of Mela’s Coil. Use the relevant traits for Fakharu (Exalted, p. 521), with the following changes: 
- It lacks the Censor’s Geas, Clothed with Humanity, Dematerialize, Measure the Wind and Seven Venoms Exhalation Charms. 
- All water-aspected effects become air-aspected. For instance, River-Drinking Renewal becomes Storm-Inhaling Renewal, consuming gale-force winds, downpours, and/or heavy fog instead of water; Drowning-in-Coils Constriction asphyxiates by pulling air out of the target’s lungs; and Flowing Body Dispersal turns the dragon’s body gaseous. 
- The wearer gains the Defining Principle “I am the storm, raining destruction on my enemies” while she is in dragon form. When the Evocation ends, she gains that Principle at Minor, or increases it one level if she already has it. Damage to the dragon’s health track isn’t applied to the wearer’s health levels when this Evocation ends, but is instead transferred into battle damage taken by the armor, requiring a major project to repair. If not repaired, the damage to the dragon persists when this Evocation is activated again. If the dragon is Incapacitated, this Evocation abruptly ends, and the draconic carving is mangled beyond use, rendering this armor’s Evocations inaccessible until repaired. This requires a superior repair project using the artifact repair rules (Exalted, p. 242). ThisEvocationcanonlybeactivatedonceperstory,unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) that upholds a positive Defining Principle focused on religion, philosophy, morality, or ethics. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
