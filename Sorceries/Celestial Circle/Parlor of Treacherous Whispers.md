*The demon Munaxes knows every traitorous word spoken. Scribing her sign upon the wall or floor, the sorcerer fills her surroundings with Munaxes’ great wisdom: Treachery is infinite and inevitable.*

The sorcerer fills a discrete area up to (Essence x 300) feet in diameter with whispering treachery, from a single bedchamber to a lesser palace. She makes a special (Manipulation + Occult) instill roll with (Socialize) bonus dice. This influence is applied against all characters other than the sorcerer within the area and anyone who subsequently enters it.

Affected characters count as suffering Major Paranoia (Exalted, p. 169) while in the enchanted space, perceiving treachery and intrigue at even the slightest provocation. Any bargain, persuade, or threaten roll to convince an affected character to confess to a treacherous deed that he’s actually committed increases the strength of Intimacy needed to resist in a Decision Point by one step. If it already requires a Defining Intimacy, it costs an additional point of Willpower to resist.

If a character’s paranoia comes into conflict with a Major or Defining Intimacy based on trust, he can spend two Willpower to resist this Psyche effect. Characters can likewise resist if presented with convincing evidence that the source of their paranoia is supernatural.
# Control
Faint whispers and the sound of churning stone can be heard when the sorcerer is silent. She adds (Essence) bonus dice on Investigation rolls to investigate treachery and influence rolls to compel confessions and repentance. If she has evidence of a character’s betrayal, she can sense the distance and direction towards him until he is punished for his act. She can only gain this benefit against (Perception) characters at a time.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
The imposed Paranoia is only Minor and affects the sorcerer as well.
