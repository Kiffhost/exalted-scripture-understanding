Observer-Deceiving Attack This Evocation upgrades Observer-Deceiving Attack (Exalted, p. 417). When the Solar uses it to make an attack and successfully deceives at least one enemy, she ignores stealth penalties from Sunflash’s anima banner until the end of her next turn. Additionally, as long as Sunflash’s anima is at burning or higher, it blinds enemies to the true origin of the attack, adding +1 to the difficulty of their (Wits + Awareness) rolls.
