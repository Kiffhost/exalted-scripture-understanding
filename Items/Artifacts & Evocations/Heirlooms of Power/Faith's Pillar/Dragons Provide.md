When the faithful call, the very stones answer. On her turn, the wielder draws [[Faith’s Pillar]] through earth, loose stones, or even solid rock, compacting them into a boulder to serve as her hammer’s head. This boulder adds (lower of [[Strength]] or the dedicated [[Intimacy|Principle]]) dice of raw damage and +1 Overwhelming on withering attacks with [[Faith’s Pillar]]. Enemies may attempt to destroy the boulder with a difficulty 4 gambit, ending this Evocation. 

## Resonant

While standing on ground consecrated by [[Faith Maintains]], the wielder’s withering smash attacks don’t cost [[Initiative]].
