*The Infernal exists on the cusp between waking and sleeping, at times haunted by the nagging suspicion that everything she experiences is but a dream.*

The Infernal no longer needs to sleep, though she may still do so. She adds (Stamina/2, rounded up) as a non-Charm bonus to Resolve against effects that would force her to sleep. She still accrues fatigue penalties from exertion, but an hour of rest or inactivity suffices to remove them.

However, the Infernal’s nightmares make it difficult to recover Willpower when she does sleep. She rolls one die, gaining Willpower for resting only if she rolls a success. (She doesn’t gain extra Willpower for rolling a 10.)
