*The martial artist howls with bestial fury, muscles twisting and eyes shining with baleful light, as she embodies the hungry ghost she will one day become.*
The stylist gains the following benefits:
 - Her lower soul swells with monstrous power. [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] based on primal emotions count as one step higher. Defining Intimacies instead add +1 to their [[Resolve]] bonus and to their effective value in calculations for Hungry Ghost Charms like [[Shrouded Claw Attack]].
 - She gains the [[Hideous]] Merit. If she already has it, she adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on [[threaten]] rolls.
 - She doubles up to ([[Essence]]) 10s on decisive damage rolls. If she [[Flurry|flurried]] the attack with a [[rush]], this can double 9s as well.
 - She adds (higher of Essence or 3) [[soak]].
## Special activation rules
Upon dealing enough decisive damage to a nontrivial enemy to increase his wound penalty, the stylist may reflexively enter this Form.
