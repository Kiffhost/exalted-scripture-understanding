*The [[Scarlet Dynasty#Great Houses|Great Houses]] think the Iselsi dead, a mighty river tamed to barely a trickle, but those waters belie the violent currents that hide below the surface.*
To use this Evocation, the wielder must be in concealment and choose a target that’s unaware of her. At the start of each of her turns, the wielder makes an opposed roll of ([[Manipulation]] + [[Stealth]]) against her target’s ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll, gaining (Essence/2, rounded up) [[Initiative]] if she wins the opposed roll. Each subsequent round, she incurs a cumulative −1 penalty on the [[Stealth]] roll. If she fails the roll, her target detects her, sensing Vengeant’s killing intent. This Evocation ends when the wielder is detected by her target or leaves concealment. If she makes a decisive attack against an enemy other than her target, the [[Initiative]] she gained is lost. This Evocation can be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a despised opponent or a nontrivial foe who wishes to protect him. 

## Resonant

As long as the wielder has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that would be furthered by killing the target, she may waive this Evocation’s [[Willpower]] cost.
