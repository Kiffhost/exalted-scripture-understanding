*The Lunar embodies the inviolate core of her being, her inchoate [[Essence]] shaped by her most deeply held beliefs.*
Upon learning this Charm, the Lunar’s player chooses one of her Defining Principles. She gains the following benefits:  - Her iconic anima and [[Lunar Shapeshifting/Tell]] subtly shift to reflect her [[Intimacy|Principle]]. Those who see either intuit that the Lunar has the [[Intimacy|Principle]]. If they share it with her, their [[Intimacy|Principle]] also counts as a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] to her for the scene unless they pay one [[Willpower]].
 - Once per scene, she waives the [[Willpower]] cost to add an automatic success on an action that aligns with the [[Intimacy|Principle]].
 - When she regains [[Willpower]] from upholding the [[Intimacy|Principle]], she loses one [[Limit]].
 - The [[Intimacy|Principle]] counts as a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to her Solar mate for purposes of [[Charms]]. It counts as positive or negative if that’s advantageous to her. If she has [[Moon-Follows-Sun Assurance]], its defense isn’t absolute; characters can make a special instill roll, rolling twice and taking the lower result, to suppress that Charm’s protection until the Lunar next gains [[Willpower]] from upholding the [[Intimacy|Principle]].
If the Lunar willingly weakens the [[Intimacy|Principle]], she rolls ten dice and gains [[Limit]] equal to her successes. She loses this Charm’s benefits until the [[Intimacy|Principle]] returns to Defining. If she fully erodes the [[Intimacy|Principle]], she can choose a new Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] for this Charm at the end of the story.
