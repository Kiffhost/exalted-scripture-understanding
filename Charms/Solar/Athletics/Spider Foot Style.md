With speed and balance heightened to the Nth degree, the Solar’s Essence may bond with a surface, allowing her to run up walls or stand upside down on horizontal surfaces such as tree branches, bridge bottoms or overhangs, or to lay flat against a ceiling looking down at her prey. Like Feather Foot Style, if the Solar is unable or unwilling to renew this effect, her preternatural grip dwindles and she may plummet and be subject to falling damage. Spider Foot Style’s effect can be extended for one round by a welldescribed stunt during a turn in which the Charm is active.
