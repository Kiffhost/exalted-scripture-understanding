*The Sidereal tends to Creation’s tattered edges, shoring up the walls of reality.*
The Sidereal undertakes a superior Craft (Geomancy) project to seal a bordermarch, shadowland, or similar incursion of an otherworldly realm. This can encompass the entirety of a corrupted region, or a smaller pocket within it. The project has difficulty 5, terminus 6, and a one-day interval. Its goal number depends on the affected area’s size:
SIZE GOAL NUMBER A house-sized structure 15 A palace-sized structure, a village, a neighborhood 30 A group of villages, a small city, a lake 50 A medium-sized city, a small city and its surrounding villages, a small forest 75 A large city-state, a large forest, a mountain 100 Success seals away the blight, restoring the land to Creation. This lasts for a year and a day, after which the blight reforms at the region’s center and begins spreading back to its original boundaries. If the Sidereal only carved out a pocket from a corrupted region, it lasts only a month before being reabsorbed.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, rituals, wards, geomantic engineering, and other mystical practices may be able to contain the blight after this time expires, potentially even permanently. This is especially true if these measures are based on facts introduced by the players or have been enacted through a successful project (Exalted, p. 226). These practices are always susceptible to some form of disruption by external forces; truly lasting solutions require a Sidereal’s continuing attention and involvement.
If the project fails, the Sidereal can’t use this Charm on that region again for the rest of the story, and it rages out of control with multiple potential consequences: the blight might spread further, dangerous fae or undead might swarm out of it, local spirits might be corrupted, etc.
This Charm normally has no effect on middlemarches of the Wyld, but if all the bordermarches touching on a middlemarch have been sealed, the Sidereal can use it to revert the middlemarch to a bordermarch until the next moon, halving the project’s goal number. If she can complete a second use of this Charm before the newly diminished bordermarch reverts, she seals it fully, as above.
