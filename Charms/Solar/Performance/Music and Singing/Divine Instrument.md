With but a gesture, the Solar dismisses her instrument. Be it a sanxian or a lyre, she sends it Elsewhere for one mote. The Solar may only draw it back with a flourish, often a swipe of her hand that causes it to materialize from a glimmer, or from a gout of Solar flame. This flourish costs two motes, and all who witness it become immediately aware of the Solar’s divinity. Any relevant Intimacies they have for “divine beings” or “spirits” or “holiness” automatically qualify as [[Resolve]] modifiers for the Solar’s music, regardless of what she intends by it.

### On [[Divine Instrument]]

I deliberated for a long time about whether to include this in the effect in the core book. I even wrote it as a different Charm, but decided to cut it for space. This Charm is actually a much better version with a more interesting name and mechanic. For those who are interested, the Abyssal version is very similar, and has you drawing a musician’s bow across the Shroud, eliciting a screech as it passes over invisible strings into your hand. Then as you flourish and bow in introduction, your instrument appears in a gout of black flame. But don’t worry; if you don’t use a bow, plectrum, baton, et al, you’ll still be covered. Another kind of Exalt has their own version called Oud Flying Elsewhere; they hold their instrument high, let go, and it falls into the sky. When they need it back they reach up and it falls back down into their hand. Even in a completely enclosed space, it comes right down.
