The Sidereal halts the wheels of a bureaucracy, putting its business on hold while she conducts her audit. After a scene spent interacting with a project or bureaucratic task, the Sidereal rolls (Strength + Bureaucracy) opposing the ([Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy) roll of the task’s leader. If she succeeds, the interval of time necessary to complete the task is increased by one step: from days to weeks, weeks to months, months to seasons, or seasons to years. This doesn’t slow physical labor, but bureaucratic functions like planning, securing authorization, and allocation of resources. Reset: This Charm can only be used against a given group once per scene.
