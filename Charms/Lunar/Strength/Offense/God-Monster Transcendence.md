*Descending on the battlefield in titanic form, the Lunar strikes like a force of nature.*
While in the shape of a Legendary Size animal, the Lunar gains the following benefits:  
- Her defenses against smaller enemies are amplified: withering attacks need 15+ dice of post soak damage to crash her. 
	- The limit on how much decisive damage she can take from their attacks now includes levels of damage added by magic. 
	- Likewise, her immunity to onslaught penalties now includes those inflicted by magic. 
	- An enemy can overcome this by spotting a weak point in her titanic form, spending 4 [[Initiative]] to make a difficulty 5 ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll that canâ€™t be flurried. Success denies the Lunar these benefits against him.
 - She can move away from smaller enemies without needing to disengage.
 - She waives the [[Willpower]] costs of Lunar [[Charms]] that enhance her feats of strength.
 - Against battle groups, her withering attacks double their attack roll extra successes when determining their raw damage. Decisive attacks against them double the damage bonus they receive (Exalted, p. 208). 1s subtract successes on rout checks triggered by her attacks.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has Legendary Size may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm. (While it has a dual-Attribute prerequisite, it counts as a [[Strength]] Charm normally).
