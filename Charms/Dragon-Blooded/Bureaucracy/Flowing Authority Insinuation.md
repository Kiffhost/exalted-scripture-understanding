*Creation itself confers its authority upon the Dragon-Blood, turning even the most meager scrap of paper into proof of her bureaucratic mandate.*
She may invoke this Charm whenever someone challenges her authority to be in a location, access an organization’s resources, or take some form of bureaucratic action. She rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) as she brandishes a blank sheet of paper or other putative token of authority, suffusing it with Water [[Essence]]. If the roll suffers any penalties due to her looking out of place, those penalties subtract successes instead of dice. A character whose [[Resolve]] is beaten by this roll perceives this document as bureaucratic credentials or permission from an authority he respects. This authorization counts as a Major [[Intimacy]] when it’s exploited. In addition to functioning as an [[Intimacy]], it also prevents affected characters from challenging the Dragon-Blood over the same reason for the remainder of the scene, including through social influence. Resisting this effect requires a character to enter a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], invoking at least a Major [[Intimacy]] and paying three [[Willpower]] to resist.
