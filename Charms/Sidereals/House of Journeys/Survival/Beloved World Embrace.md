The world will not betray its servant; infernos and hurricanes know her as a friend. The Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Survival) against the difficult of an environmental hazard within long range. If the hazard was created by a character’s magic, he makes an opposing (Attribute + Ability) roll; the Sidereal must beat both the hazard’s difficulty and the opposed roll. If successful, the Sidereal wins over the hazard. She may have it move one range band in direction and it won’t damage her, her allies, and anyone or anything else she designates for the rest of the scene. Alternatively, the Sidereal makes a (Charisma + Survival) persuade roll against an elemental or a spirit associated with an element or the wilderness. This influence is difficult to overturn (Exalted, p. 221); both the overturning character and the spirit must pay an additional Willpower.
