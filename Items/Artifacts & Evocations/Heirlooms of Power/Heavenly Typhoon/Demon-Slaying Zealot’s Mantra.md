When a condemned target attacks the wielder, a ring of ancient script appears in gold around her, driving her attacker to fear and despair. The wielder makes a withering counterattack. If it deals more than (her attackerâ€™s current temporary Willpower) damage, his Hardness is set to zero against decisive attacks with Heavenly Typhoon for the rest of the scene. This Evocation may only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial condemned enemy.
