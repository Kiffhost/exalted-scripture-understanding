*When Frey Irenio forged the daiklave Untimely Reprisal, he knew it had to be quenched and tempered ninety-nine times. But when Irenio learned that a Circlemate was in danger, he seized the still-hot blade — tempered only ninety-eight times — and rode immediately to the rescue. He confronted the Malignance of Castle Glass, whose terrible cry shattered the not-quite-finished blade. Irenio reforged half of Untimely Reprisal’s fragments into another daiklave, now lost. The remaining shards he alloyed with bronze from a demon prince’s temple bell to create a shield containing the [[Essence]] of the Malignance’s cry. He coaxed from the shield its own unique voice, a song that harmonizes with the alien music of the demon realm whence half its metal came.
Centuries after Irenio’s death and the turning of the age, a scavenger prince in the far South uncovered the shield amid the Wyld-warped, demon-haunted ruins of Ophlas. With no record of the shield’s true name, she dubbed it “Irenio’s Bell.” It has seen many uses since, from a daimyo’s palace gong to a Fair Folk giant’s buckler. Currently it resides in the workroom of the sorcerer Irenda White-Eyes, at the center of an elaborate working to call forth her patron from Hell.*
This round thunderbolt shield is of a darker, ruddier hue than is usual for orichalcum. A web of shallow grooves encircles a hearthstone socket in the boss. When struck, it rings with a pure, clear note. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Irenio’s Bell]]

Each time [[Irenio’s Bell]] is struck by a foe, it rings with a shifting alien melody, unnaturally sustaining multiple notes after being struck more than once. The shield absorbs this force as Vibration (v). It gains 1v whenever the Exalt successfully blocks an attack. The shield can contain a maximum of ([[Performance]] + [[Essence]]) Vibration. All remaining Vibration disperses at end of combat. If the wielder is dissonant with orichalcum, she loses 1v at the end of each turn if [[Irenio’s Bell]] hasn’t gained any Vibration since the end of her last turn. 
The Exalt can spend 1v to gain +1 [[Defense|Parry]] against an attack, jolting the enemy’s weapon away with the shield’s oscillations. She may also spend 1v to give [[Irenio’s Bell]] the Disarming or Smashing tag for one attack, channeling the shield’s vibrations to knock away a weapon or a foe. [[Irenio’s Bell]] siphons up sound and vibration, subtracting up to ([[Essence]]) raw damage from sound-based attacks like [[Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style|Silver-Voiced Nightingale]] kiais or a blood-ape’s Shattering Roar, and gaining 1v. Especially powerful ambient vibrations or noises — earthquakes, firedust cannon volleys, the clangorous chaos of the demon realm — may generate up to 1v per turn at the Storyteller’s discretion. The Bell’s vibrations are clearly audible. This imposes a one-die penalty on sound-based [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] rolls for every three Vibration, rounded up.
