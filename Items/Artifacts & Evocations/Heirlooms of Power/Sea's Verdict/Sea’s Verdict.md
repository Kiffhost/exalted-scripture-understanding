When the wheel-priests of Zumachi made sacrifices to the Vortex of Scales, begging him to wreck an inbound Peleps tribute ship, they assumed they’d won a few months respite. An hour later, the folly of assumptions was laid bare when Peleps Lirel stalked from the waves, dragging their elemental patron’s serpentine carcass up the beach. Sea-soaked and glaring, she recited a list of charges as the three lead priests threw themselves on her mercy, promising the young judge whatever she desired. In reply, she dragged the triumvirate to the secret jade monolith on which they offered their youths, bound them with their silver chains of devotion, and waited for the tide to come in. The final judgment she returned to House Peleps included “Attempted bribery.” Hewn from the dismantled sacrificial stone, Sea’s Verdict is a jet-black trident engraved with argent serpents and capped by moonsilver prongs. In the hands of poets and pirate-hunters it’s smashed through the living masts of the Lintha, drowned shining bandit queens in their desert castles, and cast evildoers to distant shores. To those versed in its use, Sea’s Verdict is a reminder that seafaring romance is a pleasant illusion. The trident’s spirit remains unstained by those it’s condemned, unmoved in its search for justice. Guilty or innocent, its victims are mere crimson drops in the deep black sea within. The sea has only one verdict, which it returns without thought or qualm. 

## Evocations of Sea’s Verdict 

Sea’s Verdict has its own anima banner, which grows one level when its wielder spends 5+ peripheral motes on Charms or Evocations enhancing a single attack or parry with it. As the weapon’s anima intensifies, its silver engravings writhe and dissolve like broken chains, and the black jade itself begins to expand, crack, rumble, and leak or spray dark water; a dam ready to burst. With its anima at burning, Sea’s Verdict gains the Smashing tag (Exalted, p. 586). At bonfire, the Initiative cost of smash attacks is waived.
