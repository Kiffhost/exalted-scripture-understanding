Heaven-Darkening Eclipse The Lunar shaman pronounces her binding will upon subdued devils, setting them to mend the harm they’ve done or driving them beyond the world. To use this Charm, she must successfully defeat a spirit or fae — e.g., in combat, exorcising him with Ghost-Banishing Howl, turning his court or followers against him, etc. The entity must have had a chance to oppose the Lunar. She imposes a geas upon him, compelling him to undertake an inconvenient or serious task (Exalted, p. 216) as per a successful persuade action that can’t be resisted with Willpower. If her Essence equals or exceeds his, she may impose a life-defining task. The entity must carry out the assigned task. However, he needn’t spend every waking minute attending to it, and can leave it temporarily to protect Major or Defining Intimacies from harm. He can also win a reprieve of (Essence + Willpower) days by entering a Decision Point, invoking a Major Intimacy (or Defining, for life-defining tasks) and paying one Willpower. While this frees him from labor, he can’t directly countermand the Lunar’s order. If the geas could last indefinitely or has a time-based duration, such as “stand guard in this spot” or “leave Creation and stay out,” it’s fulfilled after a year and a day spent actively fulfilling its condition. Geasa with a defined ending condition unrelated to time, such as “kill the satrap” or “move this fortress across the river one brick at a time” can extend beyond this limit. Until the entity fulfills the geas, it can’t attempt to harm the Lunar except in self-defense. This Charm can only be used against a character once per story.
