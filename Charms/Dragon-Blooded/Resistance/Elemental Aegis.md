The Dragon-Blood can banish artifact armor into one of the five elements, dissolving her hauberk into water or letting the whirling wind divest her of armor piece by piece. She may send attuned jade armor Elsewhere through a significant and dramatic manifestation of the chosenelement:itmightvanishasshewalksthroughfire, dissolveasshemeditatesbeneathawaterfall,orbedrawn beneath a tree’s bark or into the rocky surface of a boulder or stone pillar. She may use this Charm to retrieve the armor from a similar elemental manifestation, donning it as though donning it normally (Exalted, p. 591).

Once banished this way, it may be recalled through a manifestation of her Aspect element.
