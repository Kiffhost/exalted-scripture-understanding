*Poison suffuses the stylist’s skin, strengthening her unto nigh-invulnerability as she channels the Essence of every venom she’s ever encountered.*
The stylist clashes an attack with a (Stamina + Resistance) roll. If her enemy is within close range, she exposes him to arrow frog poison if she wins the clash. Extra successes on the stylist’s attack roll subtract that many successes from her enemy’s roll against the poison.
Even if the stylist loses the clash, each 10 on her roll subtracts one die from her attacker’s damage roll. If he deals no damage, he’s exposed to poison, but doesn’t suffer any penalty.
This Charm can’t be used against attacks that completely ignore soak or Hardness.
## Special activation rules
Unyielding Toad Stance can be used to enhance the clash, converting its Defense bonus to an automatic success on the stylist’s roll and penalizing the damage roll as usual.
## Mastery
No matter how many successes the stylist’s victim rolls, the poison’s duration can’t be reduced below one.
## Terrestrial
This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round.
