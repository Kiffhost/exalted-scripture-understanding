*The Infernal unleashes Hell’s wrath against enemy armadas, reclaiming the seas for those who created them.*

Upon learning this Charm, the Infernal gains one of its [[Keys]] for free. Each key enhances a different naval stratagem (Exalted, p. 245).
## [[Keys]]
#### Boiling Seas Fury
The Infernal makes a broadside stratagem. Success lights the opposing ship ablaze. It suffers one die of Hull damage, and another die at the start of each of its captain’s turns. The ship’s captain can extinguish it with a special (Wits + Sail) naval stratagem that costs (Infernal’s Essence + 5) Momentum. Even if this stratagem succeeds, the Infernal’s opposed stratagem still takes effect.
#### Corsair’s Crimson Feast
The Infernal makes a boarding action, adding her extra successes as dice on her Join Battle roll, and half that many dice, rounded up, on Join Battle rolls for her crew. If the opposing ship is populated primarily by characters that the Infernal’s crew could eat, they add her full extra successes in dice instead and gain a Major Tie of hunger for their victims.
#### False Flag Reflection
The Infernal makes a concealment stratagem, revealing that what seemed to be her ship was only its reflection on the water. She can use this stratagem even on the open seas. If she succeeds, she converts the dice added by that stratagem to non-Charm successes. The opposing captain loses Momentum equal to her extra successes, maximum (her Wits).
#### Hateful Tide Maneuver
The Infernal makes a positioning stratagem, gaining (higher of Essence or 3) additional Momentum. If she has a negative Tie toward the opposing captain, she gains (Intimacy) additional Momentum. She also gains this benefit if the opposing captain has a Tie of fear toward her.
#### Ocean-Trampling Juggernaut Stampede
On a ram stratagem, the Infernal inflicts an additional level of damage for every two extra successes, instead of every three. Against opposing ram stratagems, this becomes one level per extra successes. The Infernal gains Momentum equal to the total damage dealt.
#### Shadow of All Ships
The Infernal combines an escape stratagem with either a positioning or concealment stratagem. After the roll, she chooses which stratagem to apply, paying its Momentum cost then. If she chooses the escape stratagem, she counts as having (Essence) additional successes to determine if she succeeds, dissolving into darkness if she does. This increases to (Essence + 1) at night.
