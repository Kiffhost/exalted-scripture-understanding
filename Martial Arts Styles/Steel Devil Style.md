# Steel Devil Style
The Steel Devils are the unquestioned masters of twin blades, staining both battlefields and dueling grounds red with the blood of slain foes. The motions of the style have all the elegance and grace of a ceremonial dance from afar, but those who face the Steel Devil up close see only the impossible speed with which her weapons slice through the air, cutting off every vector of defense and bringing down death with a thousand blows. Some claim that the masters of Steel Devil style learn to concentrate their fighting skill in one hand, and to contain their killing intent in the other.
## Weapons
Steel Devil style can be used with paired, dual wielded swords. Otherwise, the stylist cannot use any Charms of this style to enhance her attacks or parries. Unarmed attacks are not compatible with this style. 
## Armour
Steel Devil style is compatible with light and medium armor.
# Offhand Charge
Warriors using Steel Devil style store Initiative in their offhand weapon. This stored Initiative is called Charge. Charge cannot be withered away, cannot be used for decisive attacks without specific Charms, and is used to create a damage bonus on certain Charms. In order to increase her Charge, the Exalt must do successful withering damage. She may then reflexively move up to (Essence or two, whichever is greater) Initiative to her Offhand Charge. This is the secret of Steel Devil style. The Exalt cannot store more than (Dexterity + Essence) Charge unless stated otherwise in a Charmâ€™s text.
