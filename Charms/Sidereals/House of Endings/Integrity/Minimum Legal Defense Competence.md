*Hoping for no more than the least she could expect, the Sidereal is unmoved by enticing promises and idealistic visions.*
The Sidereal’s [[Resolve]] can’t be reduced below (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) except by penalties from [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. If her [[Resolve]] is penalized by an [[Intimacy]] of hope, the penalty’s reduced by one.
