*Every choice creates the future that follows it — but sometimes, all choices lead to the same inevitable outcome.*
The stylist seems to multiply into countless reflections that strike from every possible angle, making (Perception + 1) undodgeable decisive attacks against a single enemy. The stylist divides her Initiative evenly among the attacks, rounded up to determine their total damage, and ignores Hardness. If she has any bonus dots of Perception from this style’s Charms, she adds that many dice of damage on each attack.
These attacks ignore Defense bonuses both from the full defense action and from cover. They can even bypass full cover if there’s any possible angle from which an enemy could be attacked, though he receives +3 non-Charm Defense against it. The defend other action and similar effects can’t protect characters from this attack unless they could protect against unblockable and undodgeable attacks.
Once all attacks are complete, the stylist appears anywhere she chooses within close range of her target.
This doesn’t count as her movement action for the round. Her reflections shatter into black glass, a onetime environmental hazard with difficulty (Perception) and damage (Essence, maximum 5) against all characters— friend or foe — within close range of her victim, except the stylist.
### Enlightenment
The stylist can direct her attacks against multiple foes instead of making them all against one enemy.
