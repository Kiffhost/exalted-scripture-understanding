Such is the Lunarâ€™s divine fortitude that she might not even notice blows struck against her. She adds [[Hardness]] to her soak against a withering attack made by a lower-[[Initiative]] enemy. If this reduces an attack to its minimum damage, her attacker loses the point of [[Initiative]] gained from hitting her. If the Lunar is unarmored, this Charm costs two motes less.
