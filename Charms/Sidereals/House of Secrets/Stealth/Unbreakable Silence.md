The Sidereal has made a labyrinth of her heart, sealing her secrets away within its coils. The Sidereal can treat influence that would make her reveal a secret or do something she knows could give it away as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). She can voluntarily reveal secrets, but doing so causes her to lose this Charm’s protection until she upholds a Defining [[Intimacy]] through secrecy, subterfuge, deception, or covert acts. An Oracle can also regain this protection by fulfilling an auspicious prospect. Characters can attempt a special instill roll to convince the Sidereal she can share her secrets, rolling twice and taking the lower result. The cost of effects used to enhance it must be paid separately for each roll. Success negates this Charm’s protection as above.
