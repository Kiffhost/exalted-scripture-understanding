*As the Infernal and her companions wander the wastes, the landscape changes to the silver sands of the Endless Desert, shifting so subtly that they can’t be sure exactly when they crossed over.*

While the Infernal is traveling through harsh, inhospitable terrain, she can cross over into the Endless Desert, five days away from the Demon City’s walls. She can bring her Circlemates, bound demons, and up to (Essence x2) other companions with her. This isn’t instantaneous, but occurs over the course of a scene spent traveling or navigating. She can’t use this Charm while in combat.

With Survival 5, Essence 2, any nearby characters that are tracking the Infernal risk following her into the Endless Desert unawares. They must make a difficulty 5 (Perception + {Occult or Survival}) to avoid this. Only one of her pursuers needs to succeed on this roll, assuming he can shout out a warning to the others. Stranded characters can return to their original location with a five-day journey, though (Wits + Survival) rolls may be needed to navigate the shifting sands.

#### Infernal Exodus Technique (Survival 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal can bring a number of followers with her equivalent to a Size (Essence) battle group (Exalted, p. 206). Characters who belong to her [[Cult]] don’t count against the limit.
