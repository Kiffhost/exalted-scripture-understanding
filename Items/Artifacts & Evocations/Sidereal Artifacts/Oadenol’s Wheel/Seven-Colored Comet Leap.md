Oadenol’s Wheel descends from the sky on a brilliant rainbow, striking with the force of the falling star it was forged from. This Evocation can only be used while the Wheel is a chariot. The Sidereal leaps up to long range above the battlefield, hanging in midair until her next turn. Unless she’s dismounted or knocked from the sky, she crashes back down to the battlefield on her next turn as a comet of rainbow flame, making a decisive impaling attack against all enemies within short range of a point within four range bands of her original location. Alternatively, one of the luminer may make the attack. The attacker’s Initiative and the +5 impaling bonus are divided evenly among all hit enemies, rounded up, and ignore Hardness. Trivial enemies and battle groups suffer the attack’s full damage and aren’t counted when dividing Initiative. Hit enemies are knocked prone and suffer a penalty equal to the damage they take on rolls to rise from prone. This attack leaves a rainbow in its wake. Once per story, the Wheel’s master can use this Evocation to leap arbitrarily high if necessary to some task — e.g., taming a new lumenir to replace one slain with Ghost-Eating Technique. She remains aloft as long as needed to attempt the task, and suffers no harm from falling. She can also use this to travel to the Demon City by leaping and cutting a hole in Creation’s sky, though she must still spend five days falling through the Endless Desert’s sky before landing.
