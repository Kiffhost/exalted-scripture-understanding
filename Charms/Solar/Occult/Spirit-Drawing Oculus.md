The Solar may channel the Essence of the world through her body, becoming a momentary vector for incredible power. While her anima is iconic, the Exalt perceives the flows of Essence around her. Even as she recognizes the inherent genius of cosmic design, she sees its flaws—loose or wasted motes, cast off from expelled Charms or sorcery, or flowing from fissures in the dragon tracks. For one Willpower, she may cast off her anima, shedding it to the dim level. It dissipates, flowing out across the world in all directions, and every loose mote it passes is drawn back to the Solar. Roll a free full Occult Excellency of the Solar’s (Perception + Occult); successes on this roll determine how many motes the Solar is able to gather. These motes may only be used to power Charms from Craft, Investigation, Medicine, Lore, and Occult, or added to the mote total of a shaping action by the Solar. Spirit-Drawing Oculus may only be used once per day.
