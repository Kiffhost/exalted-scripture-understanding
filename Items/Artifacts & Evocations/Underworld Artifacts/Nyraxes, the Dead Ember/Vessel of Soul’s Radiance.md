*Those whose souls burn like pyreflame may fill Nyraxes with the light of their glories.*
An Exalted lantern-bearer transfers a single level of anima into Nyraxes. Each level of anima stored adds one die on influence rolls against the dead or those made with Nyraxes’ other [[Evocations]]. Nyraxes’ light can’t be dimmed below that of an anima banner of the same level (p. XX).
When this Evocation ends, the stored anima returns to the lantern-bearer’s anima banner.
An [[Essence]] 3 repurchase makes this Evocation Stackable, letting the lantern-bearer store up to (Essence/2, rounded up) levels of anima with multiple uses.
## Resonant
The lantern-bearer can end this Evocation to pay an anima cost using the stored levels, rather than returning them to her anima banner.
