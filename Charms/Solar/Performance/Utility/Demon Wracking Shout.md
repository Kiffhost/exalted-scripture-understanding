Long ago, the Solars slew the enemies of the gods. Now those demons lie ancient and forgotten, dreaming beyond the pale of time. What language may name the ancient nemeses? What words have erased, music will never forget. Sometimes, when a Solar is performing an exceptionally difficult or creative song or dance, she becomes aware of a memory older than herself. The presence of demons can also trigger the sensation of knowing the form of this technique. Upon perceiving this Charm, the Solar reaches out and grasps the tendril of its Essence, drawing it into her mouth, swallowing and binding it into her throat. The player pays 8 or 10 experience points as normal, and may go into debt if she lacks the available points, paying out the cost from the next 8 to 10 experience they gain. The Charm is learned instantly (at the normal price), and may be unleashed by paying its cost. Demon Wracking Shout unleashes a sonic blast that is merely terrifying to most creatures, but constitutes a non-physical (Charisma + Performance) decisive attack on all demons and spiritual creatures of darkness within long range of the Solar, with (Essence) automatic successes. The attack cannot be dodged, only parried, and adds ten dice to the Solarâ€™s Initiative for determining base damage. This attack strikes dematerialized demons as easily as the material. This Charm may only be used once per fight.
