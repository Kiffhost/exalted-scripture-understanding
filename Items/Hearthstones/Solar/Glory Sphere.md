*This brilliant white-gold sphere adds +1 to the owner’s [[Essence]] rating for the purpose of learning the next Charm or Evocation for which they qualify, so long as it remains socketed into an attuned artifact.*
[[Charms]] which unlock [[Sorcery]] are not applicable. Once the bearer’s [[Essence]] rating increases, he may use this hearthstone to learn a new Charm or Evocation.
