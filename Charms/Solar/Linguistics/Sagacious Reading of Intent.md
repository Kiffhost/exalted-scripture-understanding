The Solar’s wit is incisive and her mind is canny. By reading a text, she also may read its author. The Solar may invoke this Charm after reading a text but before any social influence is rolled or checked. This allows the Solar to make a ([Wits, Charisma, or Manipulation] + Linguistics) read intentions action that is automatically successful. In that moment, she instantly knows if the writing indicates any of the author’s Intimacies, and what those Intimacies are. This may come across as a clear slant or bias in the narrative, or a sense of mood or emotion in the writing which highlights the context of a Tie. This Charm does not reveal the writer’s hidden motives behind any work, but it can reveal the absence of any Intimacies in the writing, potentially denoting that the work is a forgery, a copy, or that the author didn’t believe what he was writing.
