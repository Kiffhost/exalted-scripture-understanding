The Dragon-Blood’s understanding of toxins and venoms can harm as well as heal. When she poisons another character — with a decisive attack, poisoning his food or drink, using magic, etc. — she adds (Essence/2, rounded up) to the poison’s duration. Each use of this Charm only applies to a single dose of poison. If the Dragon-Blood wishes to serve a poisoned feast to her enemies, she must use it separately for each of her victims.
