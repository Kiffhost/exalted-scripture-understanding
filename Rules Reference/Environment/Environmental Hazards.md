Sometimes the world is trying to kill you outright—it’s unendurably cold, or scouring away your skin with a sandstorm, or everything is on fire. These are environmental hazards, represented as areas that inflict damage on any character within them. They can generally be mitigated to some degree with a roll, which characters are permitted every time an environmental hazard attempts to harm them. 

Environmental hazards are presented with a **damage value**, an **interval**, and a **difficulty** for the associated [[#mitigation roll]].

An environmental hazard’s **damage** is the number of dice rolled against characters subject to the hazard, as well as what kind of damage is being inflicted. ***This damage ignores [[Soak]] and [[Hardness]], and is applied directly to the character’s [[Health Track]], like a [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack]]***.

An environmental hazard’s **interval** denotes how often its damage is applied. If a hazard lists an interval of one round, it is applied to characters on their turn.

A number of example environmental hazards are listed below:

| Name                    | [[Health Track#Losing Health\|Damage Value]] | Interval              | [[Dice Rolls#Difficulty\|Difficulty]] |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Acid bath               | 3 Lethal                                     | [[Time#Round\|Round]] | 5                                     |
| Severe heat/cold        | 1 Bashing                                    | hour                  | 1                                     |
| Bonfire                 | 4 Lethal                                     | [[Time#Round\|Round]] | 5                                     |
| Lava                    | 6 Lethal                                     | [[Time#Round\|Round]] | 5                                     |
| Severe Sandstorm        | 1 Lethal                                     | minute                | 3                                     |
| Supernatural ice storm  | 2 Lethal                                     | minute                | 3                                     |
| The Silent Wind of Hell | 4 Aggravated                                 | [[Time#Round\|Round]] | 4                                     |
## Mitigation roll
A mitigation roll for an environmental hazard can take many forms:
- Toughing out the cold of the tundra ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]])
- Dancing through the maze of swinging blades ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]])
- Modifying clothing to weather the desert sun ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]])
- Holding open crushing traps ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]])

A character who succeeds at a mitigation roll manages to avoid injury, at least until the next roll. 
# Traps
Traps work the same way as environmental hazards, save that characters are allowed a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll to spot them before setting them off, and they *usually* take effect instantly, with no ongoing **interval**.
