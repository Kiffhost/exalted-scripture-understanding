The Lunar meets her foe head on, letting him waste his strength as he strikes her.
The Lunar forgoes the chance to defend against a withering attack, whether by applying her [[Defense|Evasion]] or [[Defense|Parry]] against the attack roll, clashing it, or other means.
Instead, she adds her effective [[Defense]] against the attack — potentially modified by [[Charms]] — to her soak.
Her attacker doesn’t gain [[Initiative]] for hitting her.
If the attack doesn’t crash the Lunar, her attacker resets to base [[Initiative]] before he’s awarded any [[Initiative]] from the attack.

## Protean 
In animal shapes with the Impenetrable Armor Merit, enemies whose [[Initiative]] was lower than the Lunar’s when they attacked her reset to base [[Initiative]] after receiving [[Initiative]] from the attack if they fail to crash her.

## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by taking no damage from a withering attack with 20+ raw damage.
