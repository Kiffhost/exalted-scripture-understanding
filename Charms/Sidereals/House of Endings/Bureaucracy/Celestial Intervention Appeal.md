*Making the Superior Sign of the Haywain, the Sidereal submits a matter for the consideration of those most severe of Heaven’s bureaucrats.*
The Sidereal submits a plea to the celestial censor — a lesser elemental dragon (p. XX) — with jurisdiction over her current surroundings. The censor becomes aware of the Sidereal’s current circumstances and may choose to appear at her location, potentially bringing along a retinue of celestial lions, thunderbirds, and huraka, if they deem the situation calls for it. The use of this Charm is politically sensitive, as celestial censors belong to the Bureau of Heaven rather than the Bureau of Fate. While a censor called to fight against a major threat will likely aid the Sidereal if she’s on official business, it can be seen as a concession that the Bureau of Fate can’t handle the situation, with potential repercussions for the Sidereal and the Bureau as a whole. Censors who feel their goodwill is being abused or their time is being wasted may bring low-level criminal charges against the Sidereal. 
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset by achieving a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) that benefits the Bureau of Heaven or a specific celestial censor.
