At the Lawgiver’s command, the Essence of the world opens to release a phantom steed into her custody. This mount’s coat is as black as coal, but its eyes burn with the light of twin suns, and its mane carries all the colors of Solar anima. This Charm creates an exceptional war horse (p. 567) that never tires, hungers, or thirsts, and need not sleep. This horse cannot be intimidated, nor can its loyalty be shaken. Its existence is an extension of the Solar’s own.
