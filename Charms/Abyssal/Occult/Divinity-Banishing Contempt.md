*Possession merely traps a spirit at the deathknight’s thin mercy.*
The Abyssal rolls (Wits + Occult) against a possessing being’s Resolve to exorcise it, leaving it incapable of possessing the same victim again for a season.
Exorcising a spirit with lesser or equal Essence lets the Abyssal use Spirit-Devouring Appetite reflexively to devour him. She reduces that Charm’s total cost by five motes, minimum one.
