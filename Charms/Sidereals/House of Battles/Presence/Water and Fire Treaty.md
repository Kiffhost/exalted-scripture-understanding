*The Sidereal binds the elements to fate’s defense with an offering of pain.*
The Sidereal ritually wounds herself in a ceremony involving one of the elements to entreat its protection: burning her hand in a flame, cutting herself and bleeding into water, anointing a stone with her blood, piercing her flesh on thorns, shedding her blood in the wind, or the like. She gains −1 target number on rolls against environmental hazards based on that element and Hardness (Charisma) against attacks and hazards based on it.
The Sidereal can stack multiple uses of this Charm to protect herself from other elements.
With Presence 4, Essence 2, the Sidereal can pay three motes to extend these benefits to up to (Essence ×2) characters for an instant.
