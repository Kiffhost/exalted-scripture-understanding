*The Lunar hounds devils out of the shadows, forcing them into the open.*
She makes a gambit against an enemy in concealment that she’s aware of, adding ([[Essence]]) successes on the attack and [[Initiative]] rolls. The gambit’s difficulty equals her enemy’s [[Stealth]] successes. Success breaks his concealment, harrying him into plain view of the Lunar’s allies. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with sense-enhancing [[Merits]], the Lunar may use this Charm reflexively on her turn. It doesn’t count as her attack for the round.
