The Greater Sign of the Captain shines in the Sidereal’s left eye — bright enough to be seen, unless she covers it — as she effects assumed importance. The Sidereal makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [[Sail]]) influence roll. Characters whose [[Resolve]] is beaten by this will assume the Sidereal is the direct superior of whoever present has the most apparent authority. If it’s more plausible, onlookers may assume the Sidereal holds a position in another organization that’s analogous in authority to that character’s superior. This belief counts as a Major [[Intimacy]]. The illusion is broken if the Sidereal explicitly claims an authority, privilege, or position she doesn’t legitimately possess. The apparent authority figure is affected as well, though his position counts a Defining [[Intimacy]] opposing this influence. Different characters may draw different assumptions, and the Sidereal received no knowledge of what affected characters believe. Resisting this influence requires entering a Decision Point and spending three [[Willpower]].
