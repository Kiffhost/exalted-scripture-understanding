*Charms The Solar is a world-walker of some renown, and her good standing precedes her.*
Upon encountering a perfect stranger who has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] to a character who has a positive Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the Solar, the stranger gains an automatic Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of respect for the Lawgiver. This automatic [[Intimacy]] is contingent on the stranger’s awareness of his friend’s Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the Solar, as well as his recognition that the Lawgiver is who she claims to be. This automatic Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] is fragile and can be destroyed instantly upon meeting if the Solar is offensive or demanding.
