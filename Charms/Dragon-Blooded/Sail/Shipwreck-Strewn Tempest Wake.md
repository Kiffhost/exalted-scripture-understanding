The Dragon-Blood’s ship churns the seas into a roiling frenzy in its wake, forcing her pursuers to choose between risking destruction or watching her sail free into the horizon. When she succeeds on an extended roll to escape from naval pursuit or to enact an escape stratagem in naval combat, she creates a swirling maelstrom or similar peril that the opposing captain must contend with. Navigating this hazard is a (Wits + Sail) roll at a difficulty of (the Exalt’s Essence + 2). A ship whose captain fails this roll suffers one point of Hull damage. In addition, he’s either thrown off course or otherwise delayed, leaving him unable to make any meaningful progress towards pursuing the Dragon-Blood’s ship for (Essence) days. If multiple ships are in pursuit of the Dragon-Blood or engaged in naval combat in the same waters, they must all navigate through the hazard if they wish to follow her. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) through seafaring prowess, or after using a ship to reach a vital locale.
