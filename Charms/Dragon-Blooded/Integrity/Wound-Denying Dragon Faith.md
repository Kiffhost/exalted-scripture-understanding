*Unwavering in her dedication, the Dragon-Blood won’t yield even to mortal injury.*
As long as she’s striving to pursue or uphold an [[Intimacy]] to which she’s sworn herself with [[Oath of the Ten Thousand Dragons]], [[Ten Thousand Dragons Fight as One]], or [[Unflagging Vengeance Meditation]], she ignores up to ([[Intimacy]]/2, round down) points of wound penalties. In Earth Aura, she ignores ([[Intimacy]]) points of wound penalties instead.
