*The [[Scavenger’s Shroud]] unfurls its tanned hides into a pair of leathery wings, evoking the terror of the walkuren.*
The wearer gains the following benefits:
 - She can fly, as with five-dot [[Wings]] (Exalted, p. 167).
 - While airborne, she can enter concealment without needing a hiding spot, vanishing into shadows and dark feathers.
 - She can use [[Cloak of Dark Wings]] while airborne, even if she isn’t concealed. If she’s both concealed and airborne, the Evasion bonus increases to +2 even without obscuring conditions.
 - Anyone poisoned with [[Death-Dreaming Venom]] temporarily suffers from Minor Madness (Exalted, p. 168), and must immediately make a [[Willpower]] roll against it. A crashed enemy who takes lethal damage from the poison retains that Madness even after the poison runs its course.
## Resonant
This Evocation’s duration becomes one hour. The wearer waives its [[Willpower]] cost if she renews it at the end of the hour.
## Dissonant
The wearer must pay four motes at the start of each subsequent turn to maintain this Evocation. If she doesn’t, she glides harmlessly to the ground.
