Icy reason prevails over specious arguments or seductive wiles. The Dragon-Blood may use Intelligence in place of Wits to calculate her Resolve against a single influence roll. In addition, the opposing character must compare his Appearance to the highest of her Intelligence, Lore, or Resolve to determine how many bonus dice it adds to his influence roll (Exalted, p. 218).
