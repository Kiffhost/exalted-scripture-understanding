The sorcerer conjures one of the least monsters of the Demon Realm into Creation, breaking and binding it to her will. This spell requires a ritual that begins at sundown, and ends at the stroke of midnight. A faint green glow traces out a rift between Creation and Hell, and a First Circle Demon of the sorcerer’s choice is drawn forth, howling with rage, fear, or sorrow. Demons summoned by this spell must be bound with an (Intelligence + Occult) roll against their Resolve. The sorcerer may choose to make the demon her personal slave for a year and a day, giving it a Defining Tie of loyalty to her that cannot be weakened or altered by any means and setting its Resolve to 0 against any influence rolls she makes. Alternatively, she may assign it to complete a specific task—“Construct a tower using these plans,” “Murder Magistrate Yang,” “Dig a tunnel through this wall”—for as long as it takes to complete. Task-bound demons form a Defining Principle of “I must complete my task,” which is similarly impervious to tampering. On a failed binding roll, the sorcerer is unable to bind the demon, and must make a (Wits + Occult) roll against a difficulty of the demon’s Willpower to banish it back to Hell. If she fails, then the demon is unleashed, unbound, into Creation—and is most likely very angry at her.
