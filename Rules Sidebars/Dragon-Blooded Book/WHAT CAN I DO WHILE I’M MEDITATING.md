When an Exalt meditates to use Charms like Fivefold Resonance Sense or Mind-Cleansing Prana (Exalted, p. 306), the range of actions she can take without ending her meditation is limited. The only Physical or Social actions (based on Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Charisma, Manipulation, or Appearance) that can be taken while meditating are those that are completely passive on the Exaltâ€™s part, like rolling Resistance to resist poison or asserting Resolve against influence. Otherwise, even reflexive actions will end meditation. Mental actions (based on Perception, Intelligence, or Wits) are generally unrestricted. However, a meditating character cannot roll to shape sorcery or take other sorcerous actions, or any other non-reflexive action the Storyteller deems incompatible with meditation.
