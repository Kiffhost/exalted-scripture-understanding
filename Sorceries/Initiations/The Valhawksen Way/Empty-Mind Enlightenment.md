Once per day, the sorcerer may meditate or engage in a mind-clearing ritual, rolling (Essence + appropriate Ability, unmodified by other effects) and banking sorcerous motes equal to her successes. Traditional meditation uses Integrity; tea ceremonies use Socialize; reciting poetry or performing ritual dances uses Performance; playing out complex Gateway scenarios uses War; and so on. These sorcerous motes last until the story ends or she uses this shaping ritual again.
