When an Exalt meditates to use [[Charms]] like [[Fivefold Resonance Sense]] or [[Mind-Cleansing Prana]] (Exalted, p. 306), the range of actions she can take without ending her meditation is limited. The only Physical or Social actions (based on [[Strength]], [[Dexterity]], [[Stamina]], [[Charisma]], [[Manipulation]], or [[Appearance]]) that can be taken while meditating are those that are completely passive on the Exalt’s part, like rolling [[Resistance]] to resist poison or asserting [[Resolve]] against influence. Otherwise, even reflexive actions will end meditation. Mental actions (based on [[Perception]], [[Intelligence]], or [[Wits]]) are generally unrestricted. However, a meditating character cannot roll to shape [[Templates/sorcery]] or take other sorcerous actions, or any other non-reflexive action the Storyteller deems incompatible with meditation.
