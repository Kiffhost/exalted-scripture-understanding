*The Abyssal need not snuff the flame of contagion entirely, making plague rats of her patients.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Miasma-Halting Doom]], if her extra successes equal or exceed the higher of the [[disease]]’s [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] or [[Disease#Virulence|virulence]], she may pay two motes and one [[Willpower]] to instantly complete the disease’s current interval, letting her patient roll against its morbidity. He adds all of the deathknight’s extra successes on this roll, not just half. If successful, he’s cured of the disease, his symptoms vanishing over the course of a day spent in convalescence. She may choose not to purge the disease entirely, curing her patient but leaving him contagious for the rest of the story.
