Heaven Thunder Hammer is written in reference to foes that are as large or not much larger than the Solar. Unless the Solar is extremely physically strong, even the mightiest god-felling blow will only send a tyrant lizard or other giant opponent crashing into scenery at close range. In order to launch such a gigantic foe with Heaven Thunder Hammer, the Solarâ€™s incredible strength should be surging and demonstrable at the moment of the attack. Athletics Charms such as Nine Aeons Thew (p. 267) help with this effect. When used in conjunction with Heaven Thunder Hammer, such Charms allow the Exalt to launch gigantic foes exactly as if they were of a relative size to the Exalt. Of course, combining a number of strength-boosting Charms with Heaven Thunder Hammer may allow the Solar to blast opponents across spectacular distances, causing them to leave impact craters in thick stone surfaces. How far an opponent can be hurled, and how much additional damage this does, is up to the Storyteller. Storytellers should use the basic rules of Heaven Thunder Hammer to decide what works best for their games. The exact same principle applies to the Charm Crashing Wave Throw, though characters need the Charm Dragon Coil Technique or an acceptable activation of Athletics Charms to successfully grapple gigantic foes in the first place.
