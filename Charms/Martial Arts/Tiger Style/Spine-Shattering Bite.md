Severing tendons and snapping bones, the Tiger stylist’s brutal strikes leave her enemies helpless. When the martial artist rolls 3+ levels of lethal damage on a decisive attack, she can use Spine-Shattering Bite to paralyze her enemy, slashing through tendons, smashing joints, or rending connective tissue and shattering vertebrae at the base of the spine. She forgoes two of the rolled levels of damage, and instead cripples an enemy so that he cannot take movement actions. The enemy may spend a turn trying to shake off the crippling agony, paying two Initiative to roll (Stamina + Resistance) at a difficulty of the martial artist’s Strength, recovering only if he succeeds. This action is treated as disengaging for the purposes of Leap From Cloaking Shadows, Striking Fury Claws, and Tiger Form. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood can only use SpineShattering Bite once per fight, unless reset by rolling four or more 10s on a decisive damage roll. She may then use it to enhance that attack.
