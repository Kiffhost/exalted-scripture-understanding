*The Sky-Stich Needle pierces space, leaving behind a marble-sized knot of black thread that tethers its wielder through space.*

The needle’s wielder pierces space in her current location over the course of a minute, creating a knot that hangs in the air (or in the water, on the ground, etc.). It’s visible but immaterial and remains in place for one hour. The knot immediately dissipates if the needle moves more than a mile away from it, or if this Evocation is used again. Characters capable of striking dematerialized targets can destroy the knot with a difficulty 2 gambit against Defense 1.

A second use of this Evocation lets the wielder make a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Athletics) roll to pull herself through space. On success, she immediately teleports back to the knot, ending this Evocation. When used this way, the Evocation’s Willpower cost is waived.
