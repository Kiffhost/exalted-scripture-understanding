Fire is best fought with fire. This Charm supplements a persuade or threaten roll made with Presence or Socialize. If the target enters a Decision Point to resist the supplemented influence, the only Intimacies he can call upon to justify his resistance are those based on passion. Intimacies with no emotional power, such as a Principle of belief in the rule of law, cannot be used, even if they have a higher intensity. Characters who have no passionate Intimacies to inflame are immune to this effect.
