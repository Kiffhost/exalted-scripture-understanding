Suffusing her language with the fluid ambiguity of water, the Dragon-Blood ensnares business partners or customers in labyrinthine contracts. She makes a bargain roll using any social Ability, concealing one condition or requirement of the deal from the target. If the deal is verbal, the hidden words slip past the target’s attention; if it’s written, his eye slips over the obfuscated terms. Because the target isn’t consciously aware of this part of the bargain, he cannot call on Intimacies that oppose it to bolster his [[Resolve]] or spend [[Willpower]] in Decision Points. Similarly, his [[Resolve]] isn’t penalized by Intimacies that support it. The Dragon-Blood’s influence roll subtracts a number of successes based on the severity of the clause. If it’s comparable to an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216), such as a hidden fee, it suffers −1 success. If it’s a serious task, such as committing a serious crime or making payments that risk bankrupting the target, it suffers −3 successes. If it’s a life-changing task, such as convincing someone to sell himself into slavery or trading a queen a horse for her palace, it suffers −5 successes. The target may pay three [[Willpower]] to resist, becoming aware of the hidden clause and able to call on any applicable Intimacies in response. Resisting renders him immune to this Charm for the next (his [[Essence]] + [[Integrity]]) days. Otherwise, he’s bound to the term — once he becomes aware of it, his mind rationalizes an explanation for how he could have accepted it voluntarily and why he must honor it, despite having no memory of doing so. He must comply with the bargain, no matter how harsh, unless another character overturns the Dragon-Blood’s influence (Exalted, p. 221).
