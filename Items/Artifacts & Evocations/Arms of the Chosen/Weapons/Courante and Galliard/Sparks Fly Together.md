*The swords call to each other in moments of peril, and the Exalt has learned to release herself to that call.*
While the wielder’s anima is at bonfire, if her sword-sibling is within medium range and is the target of an attack, she may activate this Charm to dissolve into her anima and re-emerge within close range to reflexively protect him with a defend other action. This doesn’t count as her move action. If her sword-sibling’s anima banner is also at bonfire, she may use this out to extreme range, limited only by line of sight to his anima. It can be used out to long range while the Exalt maintains an active anima conduit from [[Celestial Union of Blades]]. Resonant (Orichalcum): The wielder may make a single decisive counterattack against an attack against her ward for the action’s duration. She makes the counterattack after the provoking attack has been rolled, but before its damage roll is made. Resonant(Moonsilver): The wielder adds her ([[Essence]]) to her [[Defense|Parry]] against all attacks against her sword-sibling for the duration of the action.
