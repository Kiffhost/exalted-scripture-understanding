*The Lunar warlord’s forces are unparalleled within her territory, outpacing and outmaneuvering enemy armies.*
When the Lunar leads battle groups within her territory, they gain the following benefits:  - They convert specialty dice added by the territory’s qualities to automatic successes. If a roll against such a battle group is penalized by a territory’s quality, the penalty subtracts successes instead of dice.
 - They double 9s on movement actions. Outside of combat, they double the speed at which they move while marching toward battle or engaging in other tactical movements.
 - While fighting under an [[Ambush]], [[Back to the Sea]], [[Pincer Attack]], or [[Strategic Placement]] stratagem enacted by the Lunar, their attacks gain +1 [[Accuracy]].
Battle groups with [[Might]] instead convert its [[Accuracy]] dice bonus to automatic successes.
If the Lunar uses [[Fleeting Silver Mirage]] (Lunars, p. 295) while this Charm is active, she can bring an allied battle group of up to [[Size]] ([[Essence]]) with her for a surcharge of five motes per dot of the battle group’s size and one [[Willpower]].
If the Lunar uses [[Fleeting Silver Mirage]] this way to bring a battle group into combat, her [[Join Battle]] roll also counts as a Strategic Maneuver roll to enact a stratagem appropriate under the circumstances. The Strategic Maneuver roll counts as unopposed, but the stratagem’s threshold is increased by two.
