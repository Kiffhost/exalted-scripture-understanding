*Damned, Principles of Misrule The Abyssal’s shadowy network of underlings and catspaws draws the wicked and the damned into her service.*
The Abyssal rolls ({Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation} + Bureaucracy), doubling 9s. Every two successes let her immediately gain one dot of Followers or Retainers. The characters these Merits represent are recruited into the Abyssal’s organization. She can specify her requirements of the characters she recruits in detail; if any recruits that match her description exist to be recruited, her agents will find them.
At the end of the story, the Merits are lost as the recruited characters move on from the organization unless the Storyteller deems that the Abyssal’s treatment of them qualifies to retain them long-term as Story Merits (Exalted, p. 158).
With Essence 3, the Abyssal can also use this Charm to gain Allies, Contacts, Cult, and Mentors.
