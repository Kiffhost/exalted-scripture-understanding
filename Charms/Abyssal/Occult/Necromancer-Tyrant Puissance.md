*Death’s Lawgiver works dark wonders and bleak miracles, invoking ancient pacts and forbidden terrors of the sunless realm.*
Whenever the Abyssal shapes a spell to create or command the undead, inflict curses, or harm the living, she gains three necromantic motes each round she spends shaping it. Once per day, she may lower the [[Willpower]] cost of such a spell by one.
This Charm is incompatible with [[sorcery]].
