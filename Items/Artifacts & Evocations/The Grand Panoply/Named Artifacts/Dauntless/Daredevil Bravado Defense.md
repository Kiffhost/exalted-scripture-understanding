This Evocation feeds upon the Solar’s thrill of battle to increase the armor’s defensive power. To activate this power, [[Pounding Heart Triumph]] must be active and the Lawgiver has to have paid the extra attunement cost to gain the full power of [[Dauntless]]. Using this Evocation drops the armor by another 3 soak and also lowers its hardness by 5 so long as [[Pounding Heart Triumph]] remains active. However, the moment this Evocation is channeled, it can convert up to five decisive damage successes into non-successes, converting 1s in the damage roll into an equal number of damage levels reduced. If the Exalt knows the Solar Charm [[Adamant Skin Technique]] and activates it the moment she uses this power, she reduces the cost of that Charm by three. Dauntless’s hardness does not decrease on any use after the first channeling of this Evocation. However its soak will continue to lower with each successive use.
