*The deathknight topples monuments and shatters tombs to shelter herself amid their stony ruin.*
The Abyssal treats a successful feat of strength roll as roll to take cover (Exalted, p. 198) — either behind whatever object she lifted up, or the rubble left behind by a feat of demolition. The cover’s [[Defense]] bonus is increased by +1 until her next turn. This doesn’t use her movement action.
With [[Athletics]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal can pay a two-[[Initiative]] surcharge when she uses this Charm to make a feat of strength reflexively. Such feats are limited to scenery and other narratively unimportant things, letting the deathknight lift or destroy them to provide cover.
