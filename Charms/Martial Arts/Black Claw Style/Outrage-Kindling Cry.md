*Who can stand idly by while a fragile beauty endures torment and aggression from her brutish foes?*
[[Outrage-Kindling Cry]] can be used in response to a decisive attack against the martial artist, allowing her to counterattack with a ([[Manipulation]] + [[Presence]]) persuade roll against all characters who can hear her, adding (her enemy’s [[Essence]]) dice to the roll. She doesn’t suffer the usual penalties for targeting multiple characters. If the martial artist suffers any wound penalties after the resolution of the attack, then the same penalties apply to the [[Resolve]] of all targets. Any character whose [[Resolve]] is overcome turns on the enemy that attacked the Black Claw stylist, depending on the strength of his [[Intimacy]] for her. 
Characters with a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] or no [[Intimacy|Tie]] will attempt to restrain the enemy or talk him down, but will not turn to violence. A Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] might lead them to attempt to attack him, but only to subdue him or drag him away so that he cannot continue fighting. With a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] for the martial artist, they will go so far as to kill the enemy if no other recourse presents itself. A character must enter a Decision Point to resist, and treats the intensity of any positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] he has to the martial artist as one level higher for determining what [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] he can use to justify spending [[Willpower]]. If his [[Intimacy]] is already at the Defining level, then resisting costs an additional point of [[Willpower]] instead. 
## Special activation rules
[[Outrage-Kindling Cry]] can only be used once per fight, but can be reset with a two or three-point stunt that emphasizes the Black Claw stylist’s appearance of vulnerability, fragility, or her nature as a righteous underdog taking on cruel or cowardly foes. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood may only target a single character, or an audience of trivial opponents who might fight effectively as a battle group, rather than all witnesses.
