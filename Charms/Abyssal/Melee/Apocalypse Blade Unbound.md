*Violence begets violence, hastening the hand of Death’s Lawgiver as she reaps a harvest of souls.*
The Abyssal gains a special pool of Initiative that can only be used to pay the Initiative costs of Melee Charms and gambits. The pool begins empty each scene and can hold up to (Essence) Initiative. This Initiative can’t be targeted by withering attacks and similar effects. She can use Melee Charms with the Perilous keyword while crashed if she pays their Initiative cost entirely from this pool.
If they don’t have an Initiative cost, she can use them in crash as long as she has any Initiative in this pool.
When the Abyssal receives Initiative from a withering damage roll, she may transfer up to one point to this pool for each 10 on her damage roll. When she deals damage with a decisive attack, each 10 on the damage roll adds one Initiative to the pool.
The Abyssal can pay four motes, one Willpower after a withering damage roll that crashes its target, or a decisive damage roll to gain Initiative for 9s as well.
Alternatively, she can consume a soul imprisoned with Soul-Drinking Blade instead of paying this cost.
Usually, this permanently destroys the soul, but it might survive at the Storyteller’s discretion, giving the deceased’s friends another chance to free his soul — and the Abyssal another chance to exploit it.
