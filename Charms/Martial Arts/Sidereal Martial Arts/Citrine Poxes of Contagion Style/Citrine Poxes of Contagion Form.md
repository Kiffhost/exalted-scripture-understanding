*The martial artist corrupts and scars the world’s Essence; a latticework of iron appears above her like scar tissue in the sky, drenched with blood and seawater as she brings forth Iphimedeia, the Revel Outside the Sealing of the Gates.*
The stylist gains the following benefits
- When an enemy comes within short range of her, he must roll against Iphimedeia (p. 337). Success renders him immune to this effect for the scene.
Mortals and trivial characters fail automatically.
- When she crashes a diseased enemy, she may increase the intensity of one disease, maximum Defining. Incapacitating an enemy lets her raise a disease’s intensity any amount.
- Diseased characters suffer a penalty equal to the highest intensity among diseases on rolls against her.
- She’s immune to mundane poison and disease and adds (Essence) non-Charm dice on rolls against supernatural ailments. If a disease wouldn’t normally allow a roll against it, she rolls at difficulty 5.
Upon learning this form, the stylist adds Iphimedeia to the repertoire of diseases she can inflict with Feverish Essence Infection.
## Special activation rules
When the stylist successfully infects an enemy capable of posing a significant challenge to her with a disease, she may reflexively enter this Form.
