*Flimsy truths of reason and identity are caught up in the whirlwind of the Laughing Monster’s mayhem. Who can say where they’ll end up?*
The stylist snatches an imp created with [[Unitary Being Forge]] off an affected character within close range, twisting it around her weapon. It no longer grants bonus damage to attacks against that character, although he still suffers its other effects. The imp can still be attacked and destroyed, although the stylist counts as protecting it with a defend other action (Exalted, p. 196).
The stylist can release the imp through a decisive attack, embedding it in her victim’s psyche, rerolling ([[Intimacy]]) failed dice on the damage roll. If she attacks someone other than the imp’s original victim and deals at least (his base [[Resolve]]) damage, the [[Intimacy]] from which it sprang is transferred from the original victim to him. This is a mental shaping effect (p. XX). If the transplanted [[Intimacy]] is opposed by one of the character’s Major or Defining Intimacies or is fundamentally incompatible with his sense of identity, he gains a Minor [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 168) chosen by the Storyteller. Either way, the imp dissipates. 
## Terrestrial
Instead of fully transferring the [[Intimacy]], the victim gains it at Minor intensity, and the original character’s Tie diminishes one step. The stylist can’t inflict Derangements.
