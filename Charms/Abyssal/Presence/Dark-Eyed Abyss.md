*The Abyssal’s mere glance entraps onlookers, the endless void of eternity behind her gaze inescapably compelling.*
The Abyssal rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on an influence roll against a single character to seduce him or instill a Tie towards herself that’s based on desire.
She need not speak, denying her target the Resolve bonus for her using body language. If successful, she adds (Essence) to her Guile against anything that would provide information about her attempt or the motive behind it for the rest of the scene.
IT'S TIME TO PAY THE PRICE When Elegant Tyrant Majesty or a similar effect that provides a mote discount on ongoing effects ends, a character must commit additional motes to cover the full cost of each discounted effect.
Otherwise, those effects end.
With a Presence 4, Essence 2 repurchase, it becomes impossible for others to recognize that the Abyssal attempted this seduction.
