*The Abyssal secrets away the tools of her iniquitous trade and the spoils she’s reaped thereby.*
The deathknight conceals an object small enough to hide in one hand somewhere on her person. It’s impossible for other characters to notice until she retrieves it. She can stack this Charm to banish up to five objects.
