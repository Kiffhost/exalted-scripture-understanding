*The Lunar diminishes her social standing, falling beneath respectable society’s notice.*
She can use [[Fox-Tailed Trickster’s Grace]] to instill a Tie of scorn or disgust toward herself (or her current shape) in addition to the roll’s usual effects. Instead of excusing her transgressions, affected characters dismiss her behavior and any subsequent transgressions that scene as “normal” for a madwoman, foreigner, or similar undesirable. They won’t punish or reprimand her, merely wishing that someone else would attend to that unpleasant task.
