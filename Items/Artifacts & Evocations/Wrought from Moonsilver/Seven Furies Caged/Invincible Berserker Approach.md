The doomed and the damned who stand against the berserker watch in fear as their blows do nothing. She adds (Stamina) to the armor’s Hardness against a source of decisive damage. If she has any damage in her −4 health levels, she enjoys this Hardness even while crashed (but not the armor’s base Hardness, or any other Hardness). If her Hardness negates an enemy’s decisive attack, she reflexively makes an ([Appearance or Charisma] + Presence) threaten roll against him, ignoring wound penalties and adding them as bonus dice. 

## Resonant

The wielder can use this Evocation while crashed if she has any damage in her −2 levels.
