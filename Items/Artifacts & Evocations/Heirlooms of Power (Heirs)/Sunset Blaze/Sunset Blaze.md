*Commissioned by Cathak herself from the renowned smith and sublime armiger Tepet Sothal, the [[direlance]] [[Sunset Blaze]] — adorned with a banner of cloth-of-jade — accompanied her in many of her famed battles.*
She wielded it in the Realm’s war against the Blood-Sand Sultan, burning the man who feared no flame; in the great Siege of Houshou, when she seemed to slay the Anathema [[Sha’a Oka]]; in her famed duel with Ahlat.
In the hands of Cathak and her children, [[Sunset Blaze]] has become an emblem for her Great House’s martial prowess and emulation of Hesiesh in war. In the Wyld Hunt against the Lady of Crimson Nectar, Cathak Meti Lonova rallied her shikari with the sight of its flaming banner after the Anathema filled their minds with rot and death. Cathak Orina bore it in suppressing the Amaranth Uprising and in the execution of the revolt’s instigator, the renegade magistrate Haruka Mir. Cathak Fari defended Fajad’s gates from the army of the heretical Abhari prophet Kigal Whose-Name-Cuts, and burned away the rogue god’s blasphemous tongue.
Traditionally, Sunset’s Blaze has been bequeathed to young Cathak scions taking their first command in the house legions when its current wielder decides to pass it on — though in practice, the new wielder is almost always a descendant of the current one, or of a Cathak she owes favors to.

## [[Evocations]] of [[Sunset Blaze]]

When readied by an attuned wielder, Sunset Blaze’s banner bursts into flame, adding an automatic success on her [[Appearance]]- or [[Charisma]]-based command actions and threaten rolls. However, it impedes stealth as a glowing anima banner (Dragon-Blooded, p. 154). Its wielder may extinguish it as a miscellaneous action, but doing so denies her the above benefits. Reigniting it is also a miscellaneous action.
The Banner keyword indicates that Sunset Blaze’s banner must be ignited to use that Evocation.
