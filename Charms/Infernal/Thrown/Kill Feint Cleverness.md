*The Infernal toys with her victims, letting them hope that they might be fortunate enough to survive.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after missing with an attack, regaining any motes spent on Excellencies for the attack roll. Attacks with multiple targets must miss all of them to trigger this Charm.

With Essence 2, if the Infernal misses by two or fewer successes on a decisive attack, she doesn’t lose Initiative for missing.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by succeeding on a decisive attack roll against a nontrivial enemy with 5+ extra successes.
## [[Keys]]
#### Second Chances Savored (Thrown 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal waives this Charm’s cost and only needs 3+ extra successes to reset it. This doesn’t apply to other keys’ costs.
#### Striking at Nothingness (Thrown 5, Essence 4, [[#Second Chances Savored (Thrown 5, Essence 3)|Second Chances Savored]]) (+2i, 1wp)
The Infernal can play a two-Initiative, one-Willpower surcharge to refund the cost of all other Charms or magic used to enhance the attack.
