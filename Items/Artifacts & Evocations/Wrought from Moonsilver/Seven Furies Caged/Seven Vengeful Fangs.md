Seven Furies Caged roars as it’s struck, extending its spikes to impale its attacker. When the Lunar uses Knife-Biting Attitude (p. XX), she may unleash a decisive counterattack with any of her weapons after her attacker rolls damage. Her counterattack only uses the Initiative gathered by Knife-Biting Attitude for its damage, ignoring Hardness. It doesn’t include the rest of her Initiative or reset it, although the gathered Initiative is spent. If Relentless Lunar Fury is active, she can make this counterattack while crashed. 

## Resonant

The Lunar may include her Initiative in the counterattack’s damage. This resets her to base if it’s successful.
