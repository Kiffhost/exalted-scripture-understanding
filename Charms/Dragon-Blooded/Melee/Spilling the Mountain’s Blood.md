Channeling her anima banner into a murderous blow, the Dragon-Blood marks her enemy with lines of red-hot [[Essence]] that spread from the point where her weapon struck him. Her killing intent inflames these molten wounds, causing the blazing meridians to pulse and writhe until they finally erupt. She makes a decisive attack, adding (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Strength]]) attack roll extra successes as dice of damage.
If the attack deals any damage, an eruption begins mounting within the victim, culminating at the end of his next turn. He suffers dice of lethal decisive damage equal to the Dragon-Blood’s successes on the attack’s damage roll, ignoring [[Hardness]]. If this inflicts 3+ levels of damage or the victim is incapacitated before the eruption, the ground beneath the victim melts into lava, an environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 6L/ round that lasts one scene.
If the Dragon-Blood is incapacitated before the eruption occurs, her killing intent fades, making it possible to prevent the eruption. If the victim or one of his allies succeeds on a difficulty 5 ([[Intelligence]] + [lower of [[Medicine]] or Occult]) roll as a miscellaneous action, the eruption is averted as the magmatic anima is shunted harmlessly away.
