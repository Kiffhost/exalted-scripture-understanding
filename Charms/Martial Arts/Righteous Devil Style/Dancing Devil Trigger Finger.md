*Fire seems to take on a wrathful life of its own as it pours from the barrel of the Righteous Devil’s weapon, flaring off into howling, winged devils of fire that spiral hungrily towards her foes.*
Dancing Devil Trigger Finger allows the stylist to apply a decisive attack against all enemies in a ninety-degree arc. She may catch up to one enemy at close range, two enemies at short range, and three enemies at medium range (if extended using Blossom of Inevitable Demise), but only if they are positioned on the battlefield so that this targeting makes sense. She makes a single decisive attack roll, rolling damage separately against each enemy. 
## Special activation rules
Dancing Devil Trigger Finger can only be used once per fight, unless reset by upholding an Intimacy that represents dedication to Righteous Devil style’s philosophy or a similar code of ethics. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood must divide her Initiative evenly among all targeted enemies when rolling damage, and cannot assign more than (Essence + 3) damage to any enemy. Any points of Initiative that cannot be assigned over this maximum are not wasted, but converted to motes after she resets to base Initiative.
