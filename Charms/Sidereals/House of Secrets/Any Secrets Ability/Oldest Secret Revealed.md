*All secrets are identical from the perspective of one who doesn’t know them; thus, the Sidereal reasons, all knowledge is implicit in her ignorance.*
The Sidereal waives the experience point or bonus point cost for the next three interaction triggers she unlocks for her Ascending (Caste) Horoscope or Descending (Caste) Horoscope. When she uses one of those Charms, she can do so using the interaction trigger of a different such Charm. If she’s previously unlocked identical interaction triggers for different Charms, she’s refunded the experience point cost of each trigger made redundant by this.
