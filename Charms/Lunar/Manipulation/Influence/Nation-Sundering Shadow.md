The Lunar bears civilization’s shadow as a disquieting cloak. After at least a week immersed within a culture, she can use Nameless Monster Embodiment at a fivemote surcharge, targeting one of that culture’s customs. Her roll is opposed by the ([Charisma or Intelligence] + [Bureaucracy or Socialize]) roll of that culture’s leader or a significant figure within it. If successful, any members of that culture with Defining Ties toward it or Defining Principles embodying the targeted custom suffer the effects of Nameless Monster Embodiment with regard to such Intimacies. While the Lunar remains immersed in an affected culture, she can inflict an automatic botch once per story on any roll made by a leader or administrator within that culture related to a large-scale project. A culture afflicted by this Charm can end it if members of it publicly triumph over the Lunar, or if a prominent member completes a project (Exalted, p. 226) reaffirming the targeted custom. This renders that custom immune to subsequent uses of this Charm by the Lunar. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).
