*The Lawgiver looks beyond her next attack and sees the battle’s course unfold.*
She may use this Charm at any time to reflexively store up to ([[Stamina]]) [[Initiative]]. Thenceforth, upon making a decisive attack, she may choose to reflexively release her commitment to [[Superior Violent Knowledge]], pouring stored [[Initiative]] into her attack’s raw damage to boost it. This Charm expressly allows the Exalt to launch a decisive attack while crashed. 

## Special activation rules

Using [[Superior Violent Knowledge]] at the start of her turn does not affect her place in the attack order of the current round but will be reflected in subsequent rounds. Stored [[Initiative]] cannot be targeted or stripped by withering attacks. Unless used, this Charm’s effect wears off at the end of combat.
