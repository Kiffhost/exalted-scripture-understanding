*Not all of the Sidereal’s shots are meant to hit; her feints are indistinguishable from her true offense.*
After the Sidereal misses an attack, she can use this Charm to convert that attack to a distract gambit that automatically hits. This doesn’t benefit from any Charms used on the original attack that aren’t compatible with the gambit, but the Sidereal can reflexively activate Charms that specifically enhance gambits for it.
