*Possession merely traps a spirit at the deathknight’s thin mercy.*
The Abyssal rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) against a possessing being’s [[Resolve]] to exorcise it, leaving it incapable of possessing the same victim again for a season. If its [[Essence]] is less than or equal to hers, she may use [[Spirit-Devouring Appetite]] reflexively to devour it, reducing its total cost by five motes.
