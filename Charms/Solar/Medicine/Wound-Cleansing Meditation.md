The Solar’s advanced medical techniques allow her to draw the poison from unnatural wounds. With this Charm, the Solar spends an hour cleaning and wrapping wounds, disinfecting and draining injuries and preparing the patient for more complex internal treatment. At the end of the treatment, convert the patient’s aggravated damage to lethal damage.
