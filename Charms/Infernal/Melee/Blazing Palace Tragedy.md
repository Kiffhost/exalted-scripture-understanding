*The Infernal plunges her blade into the earth, casting the world around her into a blaze of hellish flame.*

The Infernal ignites a bonfire of emerald flame, a one-time environmental hazard that extends out to short range. It has difficulty 4, Damage 5L/round, and deals aggravated damage to both gods and Exalted who are Chosen by gods: Solars, Lunars, Sidereals, and Exigents. It doesn’t harm Infernals or demons.

The blaze of emerald flame can’t be extinguished by mundane means, burning until the scene’s end, though magic capable of extinguishing supernatural flame can do so.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she succeeds on a feat of demolition against a portion of structure using [[Green Sun Nimbus Flare#World-Weathering Incandescence (Melee 3)|World-Weathering Incandescence]] (p. XX). The blaze almost always results in more damage to the structure than a single feat could achieve, though it can’t go beyond the structure’s bounds.
## [[Keys]]
#### Scorched Earth Malediction (Melee 5) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene.
#### Burning World Fiefdom (Essence 3, [[#Scorched Earth Malediction (Melee 5) (+1wp)|Scorched Earth Malediction]])
The Infernal may extend the hazard out to medium range when she uses [[#Scorched Earth Malediction (Melee 5) (+1wp)|Scorched Earth Malediction]].
