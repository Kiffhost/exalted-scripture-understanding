The Lunar sends others chasing down paths that never existed. She opposes an influence roll with a special (Manipulation + [Presence or Socialize]) instill roll against its speaker, suddenly changing the topic of conversation. If her roll beats both the opposing character’s roll and his Resolve, he abandons his original intent, instead making an influence roll appropriate to the Lunar’s chosen topic. He forgets what the previous topic of discussion was for the rest of the scene, though if another character reminds him of it, he can spend one Willpower to resist this influence. This Charm may only be used once per scene. 
## Protean 

In shapes that the Lunar’s target has a Tie toward, if she successfully changes the topic to one related to the Tie’s emotional context, he can’t resist this influence unless he enters a Decision Point and invokes an Intimacy of equal or greater intensity after being reminded of the original topic.
