The martial artist moves with shifting and shuffling footwork, keeping her feet constantly in motion to emulate the spider, balanced on six legs and striking with two. The stylist gains the following benefits: 
-  She’s immune to grapple gambits, effects that would knock her prone or forcibly move her, or effects that specifically affect her lower body. This defense can be overwhelmed — after negating two such effects, the stylist becomes vulnerable to the third, after which this defense resets. 
-  Once per round, she can either reflexively glide one range band toward an enemy before attacking him or reflexively move one range band in any direction after an attack against her. This doesn’t count as her movement action for the round. 
-  When she threatens characters with a movement roll using Unnatural Many-Step Stride, they’re treated as having a Major Intimacy supporting the influence. As long as she beats a nontrivial target’s Resolve, she gains one Initiative. Enlightenment: The stylist waives the Willpower cost to dematerialize with Unnatural ManyStep Stride.
