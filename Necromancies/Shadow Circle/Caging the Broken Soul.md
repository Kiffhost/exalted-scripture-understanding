*The necromancer invokes the binding laws of the Labyrinth’s Howling Obsidian Oubliette, binding the dead to a soul cage with chains of spectral [[Essence]].*
Targeting a willing or restrained ghost or Underworld spirit of up to [[Essence]] 5, the necromancer rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) against (higher of target’s [[Resolve]] or temporary [[Willpower]]) to bind him to a soul cage — a specially prepared bone amulet, cinerary jar, or similar ritual vessel. Success binds him to it for a year and a day. While under the binding, he suffers the following effects:
- He gains a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of obedience to the soul cage’s bearer, which cannot be removed or altered by any means.
- The soul cage’s bearer may concentrate to see through his senses as if he were her [[familiar]] (Exalted, p. 161), regardless of the distance between them. She may communicate telepathically with the target while doing so, speaking directly into his mind.
- Unless destroyed with magic capable of permanently slaying spirits such as [[Ghost-Eating Technique]], he will always return from destruction, emerging from his soul cage during the next midnight.
During his binding, he cannot pass into Lethe even if he desires to, and oblivion cannot take him unless the bearer allows it.
- The bound gain access to the Hurry Home Charm (Exalted, p. 509), able to use it to return to the bearer’s side or his soul cage. The necromancer may spend one [[Willpower]] to force him to use this Charm.
The necromancer need not keep the soul cage on her person, but if stolen, the thief may spend a [[Willpower]] to become the soul cage’s new bearer. The necromancer may also willingly gift the soul cage to a subordinate. If the soul cage is destroyed, this spell’s effects end.
If made to act against a Defining [[Intimacy]], the bound spirit may spend a [[Willpower]] to roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) against (the necromancer’s [[Essence]]). Success allows him to disobey the order and lowers his [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the soul cage’s bearer from Defining to Major for the scene.
## Control
The necromancer is aware of the location and general direction of all soul cages she’s made at all times, doubling 8s on rolls to track or find them.
## Distortion (20)
Distortion must occur within short range of the target. Success imposes the effects of successfully resisting an order to act against a Defining [[Intimacy]] and disables the bound spirit’s access to the Hurry Home Charm for the scene.
