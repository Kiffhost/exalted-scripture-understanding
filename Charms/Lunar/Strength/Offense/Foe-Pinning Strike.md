The Lunar’s missiles arc through the air like screeching eagles, piercing stone and iron. She makes a decisive attack with a ranged weapon that uses physical projectiles against an enemy within close range of a solid surface or large object, like a wall or tree. If she deals 3+ damage, she pins him to that surface, causing him to suffer the effects of being grappled (Exalted, p. 200). She rolls ([[Strength]] + [appropriate combat Ability]) as the control roll, and can enhance it with [[Charms]] that benefit clinches. The pinned enemy or one of his allies can spend an entire turn attempting to dislodge the projectile to subtract two rounds of control. Alternatively, it can be removed instantly with a difficult 5 feat of strength that requires [[Strength]] 5+. Once the Lunar’s rounds of control elapse entirely, her enemy frees himself reflexively.
