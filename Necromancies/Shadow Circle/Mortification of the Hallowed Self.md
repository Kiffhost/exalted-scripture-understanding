*In an act of self-flagellation, the necromancer partially fuses with her higher and lower souls, suffusing her anima or corpus with pulsing spiritual gore.*
The necromancer’s spiritually-charged flesh allows her to perceive and interact with dematerialized characters. Magic that would already allow her to do so instead adds one non-Charm success on rolls to detect or attack them. She may spend five motes to partially dematerialize until the start of her next turn, inflicting a −([[Essence]]) penalty on physical actions taken against her unless they’re enhanced by appropriate magic and allowing her to pass through porous surfaces like grated gates or barred windows.
She gains further benefits depending on which half of her soul is currently in prominence, and may switch between them reflexively at the start of her turn:
- While her higher soul dominates, she increases the [[Resolve]] bonus of her Principles by 2. When she successfully applies her [[Resolve]] against influence that would prey on her emotions or [[Intimacy|Ties]], the character who attempted it falls [[prone]] to his knees, cowed by the spiritual pressure of her rebuke. Ghosts of her [[Essence]] or lower are forced into a full kowtow, and can’t rise from [[prone]] until the end of her next turn.
- While her lower soul dominates, she may increase her effective [[Intimacy]] level of emotions from an [[inspire]] action from Major to Defining, reveling in those pleasures she allows herself. She ignores up to ([[Stamina]]) points of penalties from wounds, poison, sickness, and other bodily afflictions, and converts them to non-Charm bonus dice on [[Influence roll|influence rolls]] to [[inspire]] fear, reckless passion, or hunger, as well as [[threaten]] rolls.
## Control
The necromancer’s scarred soul twitches inside of her, warning her when she perceives a character with Shaping magic that could reshape her mind, body, or soul. She rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) against his [[Guile]] to get a general idea of what he could do, suffering penalties at the Storyteller’s discretion if the target is purposefully disguising or veiling his powers.
## Distortion (10)
The necromancer’s souls are goaded into warring with one another. She cannot benefit from either until she centers herself with a ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) roll against (distorting necromancer’s [[Essence]]), and even then suffers a −2 penalty on her next turn from sheer spiritual disequilibrium.
Special: This spell can only be case by a necromancer with both higher and lower souls, leaving it the provenance of the Exalted.
