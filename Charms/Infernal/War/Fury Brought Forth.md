*The Infernal’s harsh drills ignite flames of rage in even the meekest of hearts.*

The Infernal spends a week exercising her command over a battle group: leading its members in training drills, giving a rousing speech or fiery sermon, threatening them with the consequences of failure, or the like. The battle group permanently gains the following:
- It uses the traits of battle-ready troops (Exalted, p. 496) where they’re better than its own.
- It gains average Drill.
- Its members gain a Minor Principle of “My rage gives me strength,” or a similar Principle based on anger. This Intimacy can’t be fully eroded for as long as they’re actively under the Infernal’s command.
- It adds one die on rout checks (Exalted, p. 209).
- However, rally for numbers actions targeting the battle group suffer a −1 penalty. Few in the furious regiment break ranks before dying, leaving little in the way of survivors to rally back.

The Infernal can spend a month training a battle group with average Drill to grant it the traits of elite troops (Exalted, p. 497) and elite Drill, along with this Charm’s other effects.

With Essence 3, the Infernal can spend a month training a battle group with elite Drill and pay three experience points to grant one of the following benefits. Any experience points spent on these benefits are refunded if the enhanced battle group is slain.
### Devil-Legion Transformation
If the battle group is made up entirely of demons or Demon-Blooded, it gains +1 Might. This doesn’t stack with the Might bonus from [[#Foe-Annihilating Hatred]].
### Foe-Annihilating Hatred
The battle group gains +1 Might while facing opposition that it has a Tie of anger or hatred for, or a similar negative Tie. If it has Might 0, the bonus increases to +2. This doesn’t stack with the Might bonus from [[#Devil-Legion Transformation]].
### Rage Beyond Fear
The battle group gains perfect morale (Exalted, p. 210). The Resolve bonus from any anger-based Intimacies they have is increased by one — but so is the Resolve penalty.
