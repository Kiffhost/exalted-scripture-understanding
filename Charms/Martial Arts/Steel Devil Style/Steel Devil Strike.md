*The ultimate killing technique of this style is a swift, hidden strike that occurs directly after a successful use of [[Double [[Attack]] Technique]].*
This Charm can only be triggered when the damage done by [[Double [[Attack]] Technique]] is equal to or greater than the amount of Offhand Charge capacity that has yet to be filled with Charge. If this occurs, the Exalt may pay the cost to launch a decisive attack with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes, which ignores hardness and uses only the [[Initiative]] gained from Double [[Attack]] Techniqueâ€™s withering damage as base damage. If this attack is successful, all of the [[Initiative]] expended in making it is lost. 
## Mastery
When in [[Steel Devil Form]], if the Exalt successfully damages an opponent with [[Steel Devil Strike]], he gains a point of temporary [[Willpower]].
