*Flowing with the tides of a bureaucracy, the Dragon-Blood rises effortlessly to the top.*
She makes a special ({Appearance or Manipulation} + [[Bureaucracy]]) [[instill]] roll, ignoring the penalty for [[Social Influence#One Target vs. Many Targets|group influence]], against all members of a specific organization present in a scene.
A character whose [[Resolve]] is beaten will perceive the Dragon-Blood as either someone who holds a position of superior rank within that organization or as someone whose credentials make them a natural choice for filling such a role, depending on which option is more plausible.
The Dragon-Blood gains the benefits of any positive Ties those characters have toward the organization in question, and affected characters will carry out any inconvenient tasks (Exalted, p. 216) she assigns them without requiring an influence roll if they have such a [[Intimacy|Tie]].
While this Charm is active, the Dragon-Blood may use [[Flowing Authority Insinuation]] for only five motes if she targets an affected character, and such characters can’t resist with [[Willpower]] unless they first resist this effect.
She waives Thrashing Carp Serenade’s [[Willpower]] cost when she uses it against an organization she’s used this Charm to secure a position of authority within.
This effect can be resisted for one [[Willpower]], but only when a character is confronted with evidence that the Dragon-Blood doesn’t actually hold a position within the organization or is unqualified to do so, when he’s mistreated by the Dragon-Blood, or when another organization member succeeds on an instill roll to turn him against the Dragon-Blood. Characters who resist realize they’ve been deceived, but not that mind-altering magic is involved.
When this Charm ends, all affected characters that didn’t resist gradually begin to realize that they’d mistaken the Dragon-Blood for someone in authority, though they don’t realize they were deceived. Depending on how the Dragon-Blood acted on the group’s behalf, they may form positive Ties toward her and offer her a formal position within it.
