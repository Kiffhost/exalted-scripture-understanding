With this Evocation the Exalt can push past her normal limits by drawing strength from Dauntless’ innate encouragement. If activated while the Exalt is in crash, the cost simply drops her [[Initiative]] further into the negative. The armor’s soak is reduced by three points, but gains one !!non-CharmsuccessonawitheringattackmadewithMelee,!! [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] for the rest of the scene. In addition, successfully gaining the upper hand over her opponent reinforces the Exalt’s confidence and drive to press her !!advantageasfaraspossible.Eachtimeshesuccessfullyhits!! a target with a withering attack made with [[Melee]], [[Brawl]] !!orMartialArts,shemayincreasethearmor’ssoakby1.The!! armor’s soak cannot be increased past its soak value. 

## Special activation rules

Rather than being bought with experience, [[Pounding Heart Triumph]] is unlocked when the Solar defeats an opponent or battlegroup that represents a Major or Defining threat.
