# [[Mantis Style]]
Mantis style emphasizes a combination of grappling and rapid strikes. It draws no distinction between offense and defense, employing painful joint holds that leave enemies unable to fight back or deflecting the force of a blow so that the attacker’s guard is left wide open. It’s commonly studied by Immaculate monks for its ability to subdue foes without killing, but is also widespread throughout Eastern and Southern dojos. 
## Weapons
Practitioners deliver unarmed attacks with mantis hook strikes — using one to three fingers to strike weak points, grab foes, and block attacks — as well as knee and elbow strikes. Mantis style also uses [[Club|batons]], [[Sickle|kamas]], [[nunchaku]], [[Seven-Section Staff|seven-section staffs]], and [[Wind and Fire Wheel Fan|war fans]]. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced by Mantis [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage.
## Armour
Mantis style is incompatible with armor.
