With an infusion of Essence, the Solar breaks the water’s grip on her vessel. The Exalt may sail against a current, reducing penalties to the ship’s speed by two. This Charm also helps the ship resist violent suction such as that employed by certain sea monsters, subtracting two successes from rolls to pull the ship through the water by means of a vacuum, whirlpool, or other suction.
