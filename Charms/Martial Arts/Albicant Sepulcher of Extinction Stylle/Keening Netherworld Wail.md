*Looking on a world of endless suffering, the bleak saint cries out with sorrow to shatter the heavens.*
The stylist unleashes an eerie wail, making a ([[Charisma]] + ([[Martial Arts]] or [[Performance]])) [[inspire]] roll to spread despair among all enemies within long range, capable of being heard over even the loudest tumult or magical silence. She ignores multiple target penalties. If a nontrivial enemy has an [[Intimacy]] reflecting a negative outlook that she’s aware of, her grief at this adds ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm successes on the roll.
In addition to the influence’s usual effects, inspired enemies lose [[Initiative]] equal to the stylist’s extra successes over their [[Resolve]], maximum (stylist’s [[Essence]]). The [[Resolve]] penalty inflicted by their despair also penalizes their [[Defense]] against the stylist’s attacks, as part of them seeks their end at her hands.
The inspired sorrow’s Resolve penalty also applies against [[Rejoice! The Abattoir Awaits]]. It likewise subtracts from the difficulty of gambits to damage an Intimacy manifested with [[Let Every Chain Be Broken]].
Resisting this [[influence]] costs three [[Willpower]]. Affected characters still lose [[Initiative]] even if they resist.
## Special activation rules
The stylist can use [[The Gift All Life Is Given]] reflexively with this [[Charm]], using her [[inspire]] roll for it rather than making a separate roll.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by defeating a non-trivial opponent in a way that upholds an [[Intimacy]] related to death.
