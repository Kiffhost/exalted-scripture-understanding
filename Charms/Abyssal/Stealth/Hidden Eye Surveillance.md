*The deathknight patiently observes her prey, unseen and unsuspected.*
The Abyssal adds ([[Stealth]]) dice on a [[Perception]] roll with any Ability against someone who’s unaware of her presence. Alternatively, she can use this Charm against characters with positive Ties to her, but only if she intends to betray their trust with the information gathered.
If the Abyssal’s target has an [[Intimacy]] that supports keeping whatever her roll would reveal a secret, that [[Intimacy]] penalizes his [[Guile]] against the Abyssal’s roll, as with [[Resolve]]. If he suffers from Paranoia, it likewise penalizes his [[Guile]].
