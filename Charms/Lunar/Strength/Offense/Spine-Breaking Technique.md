*The Lunar twists her prey’s body to its breaking point, snapping tendons and cracking vertebrae.*
She makes a decisive savaging attack against a grappled enemy without resetting to base [[Initiative]]. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Lunar’s [[Initiative]] and then rising to [[Initiative]] 12+ from a withering savaging attack.
