The Evocations of paired artifact weapons are usually tied to possession of both. Losing one weapon may weaken or remove some of the pair’s Evocations until they’re together again, at the Storyteller’s discretion. Others may remain fully functional. For instance, the individual Forms of Razor Dancer and Wise Steel (p. 41) should function normally when wielded alone, while Razor Steel Lovers Form only functions when the swords are paired. New Evocations can still be coaxed from the remaining weapon.

If a character develops Evocations for one weapon before obtaining or regaining its mate, she treats each weapon as a separate artifact for awakening its Evocations, with each providing their own unique Evocation tree. It is possible that the two trees might converge through effects that carry cross-synergy. Alternatively, an artificer may use a single activation of Celestial Reforging Technique (p. 19) on both artifacts to swap out Evocations for the individual weapons and replace them with Evocations that treat the weapons as a set.
