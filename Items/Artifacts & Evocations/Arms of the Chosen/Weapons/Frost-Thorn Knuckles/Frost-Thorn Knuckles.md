The [[Frost-Thorn Knuckles]] are gauntlets of runeetched moonsilver. They have no blades, instead forming talons of diamond-hard ice when attuned. Amid the uttermost North’s glacial cold, the huntress Orphan-Maker wrought the [[Frost-Thorn Knuckles]] from the [[Essence]] of great beasts. The moonsilver of their forging was tempered with a hawk’s swiftness, had a mammoth’s endurance folded into its metal, and was strengthened with a tyrant lizard’s sinews. With the [[Frost-Thorn Knuckles]], Orphan-Maker cut out the Many-Limbed Queen’s heart, stalked the sorcerer Yevash Jul in his own eldritch lair to drink his heart’s blood, and drove an invading host of Winter Folk back into the Wyld. Orphan-Maker was buried with her weapons, put to rest in a tomb carved into a savage mountainside by her fellow [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] elders. It went undisturbed until just recently, when the Lunar’s new incarnation — CatFooted Jal — followed her past life’s memories back to the sepulcher. As she confronted her predecessor’s hungry ghost, Jal spoke of her own hunt, a vendetta against the [[Guild]] merchants whose heroin had left her lover dead. She took the weapons from the tomb with her predecessor’s blessing, and left a trail of ice-cold corpses behind her. The last on Jal’s list, the merchant prince and scavenger lord Lace of Thorn, has sequestered herself in the fortified merchant city of Koja. She has spent an empress’s ransom retaining Exigents, outcastes, and mercenary spirits as bodyguards, and would handsomely reward anyone who proves their strength to her. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the [[Frost-Thorn Knuckles]]

When attuned, the Frost-Thorn Gauntlets grow claws of ice that grant the piercing tag. The wielder can attack out to medium range with the claws using [[Thrown]], sending the talons flying forward like darts before reflexively creating new ones. In addition, she awakens [[Rimebound Predator Endurance]] at no cost.
