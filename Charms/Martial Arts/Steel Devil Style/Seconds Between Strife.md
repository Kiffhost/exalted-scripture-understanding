The Steel Devilâ€™s killing blade hums with lethal readiness, carrying her swiftly toward prey. This Charm supplements a rush action (p. 197), allowing the Exalt to pay one point of Charge per automatic success on the rush. If the rush succeeds, the Exalt retains the points of Charge that were spent.
