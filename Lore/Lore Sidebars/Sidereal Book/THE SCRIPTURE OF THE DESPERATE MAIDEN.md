Once, there was a maiden…
...and things just didn’t go well for her.
It was just the way of the world, you know?
She had to give up power to get it, and she didn’t
get much.
Some people hated her for getting any power at
all.
She needed a protector,
so she gave herself to a man named Necessity.
“Love is hard,” she said.
