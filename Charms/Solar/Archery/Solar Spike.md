*The Lawgiver draws a blazing bolt of [[Essence]] across her bow and fires it.*
The attack ignores the range of her weapon, and can be made from medium or long range without an aim action, or extreme range with an aim action. The Exalt must have higher [[Initiative]] than her target to use this attack; the conjured Spike does not use the Solar’s [[Initiative]] to do damage, but instead has a raw damage equal to her current temporary [[Willpower]] multiplied by one-or the rating of any [[Intimacy]] she is trying to uphold or protect.
[[Solar Spike]] is incompatible with [[Fiery Arrow Attack]] and [[Rain of Feathered Death]], and does not reset the Exalt’s [[Initiative]] to base on a hit. 
[[Solar Spike]] may only be used once per scene, but can be reset by landing a withering attack with six 10s rolled across the attack and damage rolls.
