The Sidereal looses countless arrows in all directions, only for them to converge upon a single foe from every side. The Sidereal makes (lowest of Dexterity, Perception, or Wits) decisive attacks against a single enemy. Each may be either a damaging attack or a distract gambit. Each attack has a base pool of (Essence) dice for its damage or Initiative roll; the Sidereal divides her Initiative evenly among them, rounded up. If she hits with at least one attack — damaging or a gambit —she resets to base Initiative once all attacks are completed. Gambits’ Initiative costs are waived. The Sidereal need only pay Any-Direction Arrow’s cost once to enhance all attacks. Likewise, magic that only applies to gambits need only be used once to enhance all distract gambits.
