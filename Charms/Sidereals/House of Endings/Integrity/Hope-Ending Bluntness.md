Hope is precious but fragile; it can be broken with but a word. The Sidereal makes an instill roll against one character to weaken a hopeful Intimacy, a persuade roll to convince him to abandon a course of action he thinks will fulfill his hopes, or an inspire roll to fill him with despair. Affected character also succumb to a dark melancholy, treating hopeful Intimacies as one step weaker and suffering +1 target number on social and mental rolls related to such Intimacies. This lasts until another character overturns this melancholy (Exalted, p. 221).
