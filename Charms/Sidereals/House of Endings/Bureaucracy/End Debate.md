*The Sidereal throws down a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden’s Promise, which explodes in a searing amethyst light that brings conversation and debate to a close.*
The Sidereal makes a special ([[Strength]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) persuade roll to bring an argument, debate, meeting, planning session, or similar interaction to an end, preventing any further opinions from being voiced. Anyone wishing to get in a final influence roll may pay one [[Willpower]] and roll ([[Wits]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) opposing the Sidereal. If multiple characters attempt to do so, only the one with the highest successful result gets to speak. Once any final remarks are concluded, all characters involved immediately cease discussion and immediately make a decision, take a vote, or take other appropriate action based on what’s been said so far. If no such decision is necessary, participants simply lose interest and wander off. If a character’s [[Resolve]] is beaten, he can’t take issue with the process by which the decision was reached, though he may disagree with the decision itself. He forgets the Sidereal’s use of this Charm is forgotten by witnesses, assuming the conversation reached a natural ending while he wasn’t paying attention. If ending the conversation threatens one of a character’s Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he may pay three [[Willpower]] to resist; while other participants remain silent, he can continue to speak. This also renders him immune to the additional effects described below. If the Sidereal knows [[Icy Hand]], ending a conversation among an organization’s members about a corrupt agenda or activities lets her inflict that Charm’s effect on group members whose [[Resolve]] is beaten by her roll. This is permanent unless they resign their position within that organization and refrain from any involvement with it for the rest of the story. Alternatively, if the Sidereal ends a conversation about a bureaucratic task she’s stymied with Paralyzed Mandarin Infliction with one of that task’s leaders, she can bring that task to an end if her successes exceed the leader’s [[Resolve]]. He’ll take all steps possible to abandon it as quickly as possible, though he may face pushback from others within the organization. He can’t subsequently initiate a similar task, though others in the organization are unaffected. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through bureaucratic reforms, investigations into corruption, etc.
