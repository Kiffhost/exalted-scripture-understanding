Expounding on the importance of tradition and social order while inveighing against disloyalty, the Dragon-Blood strengthens the foundations of society. She rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Socialize]]) to instill one or more members of a single culture or social group with a Tie of loyalty towards that society, doubling 8s and ignoring the penalty for influencing multiple characters. A character whose [[Resolve]] is beaten must enter a Decision Point and call on a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] to resist the Tie being created. As usual, strengthening an existing [[Intimacy]] can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]]. An affected character cannot voluntarily weaken the instilled Tie until (6 − his [[Integrity]]) weeks have passed, nor can he take actions that would oppose the [[Intimacy]] during that time, unless failing to do so would oppose a Defining [[Intimacy]].OthercharacterscanattempttoerodetheTienormally using social influence, but are subject to the rules for overturning social influence (Exalted, p. 221). Fully eroding the [[Intimacy]] frees the character from this Charm’s effects. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) that benefits a culture or social group that the Exalt belongs to.
