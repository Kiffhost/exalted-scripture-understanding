The White Reaperâ€™s corona flashes, then surges in one vast rush to the leading edge of her strike. A withering attack converts up to (Strength) dice of post-soak damage to automatic successes, and ignores any soak bonuses a battle group receives from its Size. Decisive attacks convert (lower of Strength or Essence) dice of raw damage to successes, and also double their effective raw damage for calculating how many extra levels of damage they deal to a battle group (p. 208). While White Reaper Form is active, Greatest Killer Attitude adds an additional die of post-soak damage to a withering attack for every halo the martial artist has. However, at the end of the turn, all halos burn away, as with Bleeding Crescent Strike.
