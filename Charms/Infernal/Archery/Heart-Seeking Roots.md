*Razor-sharp tendrils bloom from the Infernal's arrow and burrow into her victim's flesh, seeking both his heart and the secrets hidden within it.*

The Infernal makes a decisive attack against an enemy she is aiming against. If this deals 3+ levels of damage, her projectile begins burrowing into her victim's flesh. At the start of each of his turns, he suffers (Infernal's Essence/2, rounded up) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. If this deals damage, the tendrils burrow deeper, increasing the damage of subsequent rolls by one, maximum 5, and revealing one of the victim's Intimacies to the Infernal. His player chooses which Intimacy to reveal.

If the Infernal knows one of her target's Intimacies, she can use it as a path to her victim's heart, increasing the projectile's starting damage to ({Essence + Intimacy}/2, rounded up) dice. However, dealing damage doesn't reveal her target's other Intimacies if she does.

The burrowing projectile stops growing once the scene ends. Removing it before then requires magic that lets characters perform surgery nearly instantly, like Instant Treatment Methodology (Exalted, p. 342). Doing so requires a (Wits + Medicine) roll at difficulty (2 + projectile's dice of damage).
