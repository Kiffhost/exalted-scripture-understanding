*Standing over a cowering recruit as her Deathlord once stood before her, the Abyssal accepts another’s vow of damnation.*
When the Abyssal receives a promise of loyalty from someone or admits a willing recruit into her army or other fighting force, she binds them to her service. He gains a Minor Tie of loyalty to the deathknight, potentially converting would-be infiltrators and double agents, or strengthens an existing Tie by one step.
The pledge need not be sincere, but it must be made willingly, and the Abyssal must be present in person to accept it.
A battle group made up entirely of characters with such Ties gains +1 permanent [[Willpower]], maximum 10, while fighting under the deathknight’s command. Living characters with such Ties always linger as ghosts if slain in the Abyssal’s service, always retaining the Tie.
This power is more effective against both mortals and [[Essence]] 1 ghosts if their [[Willpower]] is less than or equal to the Abyssal’s [[Essence]], as well as trivial characters. Such characters gain a Major Tie instead. If they attempt to betray the Abyssal while still under her service, they die instantly. Ghosts instead suffer permanent destruction, consumed by malefic [[Essence]]. If a group of such characters makes a pledge to the Abyssal simultaneously, she can bind them all with a single use of this Charm.
If a [[Moonshadow]] Caste uses [[Loyal Unto Death]] together with her oath-binding anima power, she waives this Charm’s cost.
