To use this Evocation, the wearer must spend at least five minutes meditating in the Underworld, a shadowland, or an Abyssal demesne or manse.
*The world around her seems to crumble into nothingness, revealing the all devouring void that lurks just beneath Creation’s skin. There, on the edge of the void, the wielder may bargain with the ancient and unknowable dead.*
Any gift gained through this Evocation comes at a price specified by the Storyteller. Depending on what the wearer requests, it is treated as a Minor, Major, or Defining pact. Minor pacts should be relatively simple for the wearer to accomplish, and completable within the current or next session. Fulfilling a Major pact requires an undertaking equivalent to a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170). Defining pacts require an undertaking comparable to a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) to repay. If the wearer fails to uphold her end of the bargain or appears to renege on it, she suffers the void’s wrath, as though she’d broken an oath consecrated by the [[Eclipse]] anima power (Exalted, p. 176). 
**Artifacts**: The void can reveal the location of an artifact that’s free to claim. The wearer may freely specify the details of the artifact she wishes for, such as an orichalcum daiklave or a weapon with power against the Fair Folk, but cannot choose a specific artifact. Asking for a two-dot artifact requires a Minor pact; a three- or four-dot artifact requires a Major pact; and a five-dot artifact requires a Defining pact. [[Artifact]] N/As cannot be granted except at the Storyteller’s dispensation. 
**Favor**: The wearer may ask the void to curry favor with a specific undead, such as an ancestor spirit or the tyrannical nephwrack queen Scorpion-Flail Kigaru. The next time she interacts with that character, she is marked with a bloody sign of the void’s favor. The chosen character is treated as having a positive Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] with a context of the Storyteller’s choice towards the wearer for the scene, and his retinue gain it as a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]]. This normally requires a Major pact, but is a Defining pact if the Storyteller deems the chosen character is too powerful to be easily swayed, such as a Deathlord or any undead Exalted. 
**Manses**: If the wearer uses this Evocation in the Underworld or on an Abyssal demesne, she may beckon the void to raise an Abyssal manse, its structure taking form from shadowy [[Essence]] that suppurates up from the void into the world. The manse is lesser unless it is raised on a greater demesne. This requires a Major pact. 
**Other [[Merits]]**: The wearer may petition the void for undead armies, lost treasures of the grave, spectral retinues, or any other Underworld-related asset that could be represented as a Story Merit (Exalted, p. 158). One- or two-dot [[Merits]] require a Minor pact; three- or four-dot [[Merits]] require a Major Pact; five-dot [[Merits]] require a Defining pact. Power: The void may grant powers the Storyteller deems suitable, such as custom [[Evocations]] of [[Five Edicts Dominion]], [[Charms]] that resonate with the armor’s themes, or spirit [[Charms]] with the [[Eclipse]] keyword possessed by the undead. The wearer must meet all minimums and prerequisites, but need not spend experience. This normally requires a Major pact, although the Storyteller may require Defining pacts for bestowed powers that are stronger than these guidelines describe. 
This Evocation can only be used once per story. It cannot be reset by the [[Dawn]] Caste anima power.
