The Exalt weaves a narrative so plausible and compelling that those who hear it forget the truth and believe the narrative. The Solar speaks for at least a minute, though more complex narratives may require longer. Roll the Exalt’s ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance) against the group’s Resolve, subtracting successes instead of dice (p. 188) for truly outrageous claims. Mere success entails a simple belief in the facts as the Solar has presented them. Extra successes, however, increase commitment to this belief. Affected characters gain a Resolve bonus equal to half the extra successes, rounded up, to defending their belief in the Solar’s narrative. Until that belief is shattered, they will act in direct agreement with the Solar’s version of events. In order to break his commitment, a character must present direct evidence to the contrary and defeat the character’s boosted Resolve. Failing to do so makes the character immune to further attempts to erode this belief for the rest of the day. Each time an unsuccessful attempt is made, the affected character’s bonus Resolve is diminished by two. Once the Solar has successfully changed a target’s memories, she may not make additional changes to that character’s mind with this Charm until the initial belief has been completely broken. The Solar may target herself with this Charm, but doing so earns her a single point of limit in addition to the Charm’s cost. At Essence 4+, the Solar may use this Charm up to (Essence) times on a single character, including herself. At Essence 4+, the Solar may repurchase this Charm, teaching herself a five mote, one Willpower, instant, reflexive version of this Charm that may only target a single character. The Solar distills an entire soul-binding speech down to a single statement, allowing her to change a target’s memories mid-conversation.
