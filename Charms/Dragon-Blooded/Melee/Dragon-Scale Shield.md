The Dragon-Blood channels the force of her elemental Aspect into her defense, wreathing her blade or shield in anima. She gains a benefit based on her Aspect: 
### Air
The Dragon-Blood’s weapon unleashes a blast of air as she defends, adding +1 Parry as a non-Charm bonus against any ranged attack with a material projectile.

### Earth
The Dragon-Blood’s weapon takes on the weight of mountains, adding +1 Parry as a non-Charm bonus against a disarm gambit. If she blocks with a heavy weapon, she can apply this bonus against any attack, and increases the bonus against disarm gambits to +2.

### Fire
The Dragon-Blood’s defense radiates fiery intensity. A successful block against an attacker at close range causes him to lose one [[Initiative]], plus one [[Initiative]] for every 1 he rolls (which she doesn’t gain).

### Water
A swirling ribbon of water coils around the Dragon-Blood’s weapon, lashing out at attackers. If she successfully blocks an attack from close range while benefitting from a Full [[Defense]], her attacker incurs a –1 onslaught penalty.

### Wood
Vibrant flower petals trail behind the Dragon-Blood’s weapon, as beautiful as they are deadly. If she successfully blocks an attack from close range, her attacker is exposed to a poison with Damage 1i/round (L in Crash), Duration (the Parry applied against his attack) rounds, and a –1 penalty.
The Dragon-Blood may purchase additional elemental variants of this Charm for three experience points each.
She can activate this Charm multiple times against a single attack to stack the benefits of different elemental variants. The Air variant can be used against non-ranged attacks if combined with another element.
