*Essence refines the Lunar’s senses in battle, eliminating flaws in her awareness.*
She rerolls 1s until they cease to appear on a [[Join Battle]] roll or a roll opposing [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] in combat. While [[Sense-Sharpening Change]] is active, beating an enemy’s [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] roll in combat awards the Lunar one [[Initiative]]. 
## Totemic 

Lunars with predatory spirit shapes may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm, with [[Grudge-Nursing Resentment]] (p. XX) and [[Unwavering Predator’s Eye]] as its prerequisites.
