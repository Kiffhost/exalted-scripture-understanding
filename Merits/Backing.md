This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
The character enjoys official standing in an organization, which is defined when this Merit is obtained. For example, she might be a government minister, a military officer, a [[Guild]] merchant, or a member of a spy network. [[Backing]] represents the support the character can call upon from the organization.
Two-dot [[Backing]] represents either a low-level position within an organization of significant power (such as a dues-paying Guildsman of no particular standing), or a solid post in a less powerful organization, with most disagreeable duties pawned off on subordinates (an officer within the market guard of Gem).
Three-dot [[Backing]] represents middling rank in a powerful organization (a merchant prince of the [[Guild]]), or standing as one of the elite in a smaller organization (a captain of the market guard).
Four-dot backing represents elite rank in a mighty organization (a [[Guild]] factor) with significant support.
### Drawback
[[Backing]] represents membership rather than leadership. Characters will have to answer to superiors and uphold the duties of their station to retain it.

#### Dragon-Blooded
Common sources of [[Backing]] for Dynasts include the Thousand Scales, the Immaculate [[Order]], their house’s legions or business interests, the Imperial Navy, the Magistracy, the Deliberative, and the All-Seeing Eye. Common sources for Lookshyan Dragon-Blooded include the field forces, the Lookshyan navy, the directorates, the gentes’ business interests, and the Shogunate [[Bureaucracy]].

#### Lunar
Good standing in the [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] is represented with [[Backing]], letting Lunars leverage renown into support from fellow Chosen.

#### Sidereal
Most have at least two-dot [[Backing]] in the [[Lore/Factions/Bureau of Destiny|Bureau of Destiny]]. Those without [[Backing]] are fresh recruits, under disciplinary probation, distrusted by the bureau, etc. Four-dot [[Backing]] at character creation can represent being a favorite or protégé of a prominent elder Sidereal or high-ranking god, or a position secured through bribery, blackmail, or similar means. 
Most Sidereals who’re politically aligned with the Bronze Faction or Gold Faction don’t have [[Backing]] in them. Those who do hold recognition and political power within a faction, giving them a meaningful voice in its decision-making. Four-dot [[Backing]] is limited to a faction’s foremost elders. It’s not available at character creation. Faction Sidereals may also have [[Backing]] in the Immaculate [[Order]] or the [[Cult]] of the Illuminated.
#### Abyssal
Many Abyssals holding Backing within organizations and institutions led by their [[Deathlords]], like [[First and Forsaken Lion]]’s Legion Sanguinary or the ecclesiastic hierarchy of the [[Bishop of Chalcedony Thurible|Bishop of the Chalcedony Thurible]]’s Shining Way.
