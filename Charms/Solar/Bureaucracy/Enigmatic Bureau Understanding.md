*The Exalt can govern an organization with preternatural awareness.*
With this Charm, the Lawgiver is made aware when the member of an organization has his [[Intimacy]] for the organization challenged by any kind of social influence that does not involve the Psyche keyword. This awareness is contingent on the Solar having used read intentions actions to uncover the relevant [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] of the character in question. The Solar’s awareness extends to the moment the character’s [[Intimacy]] is challenged if and only if the character is currently functioning in some capacity for the organization. If the subject is not presently working for the Solar, she only notices that someone has attempted to influence him when he returns to his role or functions as a member of the organization. This clarification applies to current as well as former members—the Exalt only immediately notices influence against a character who is currently on duty. This Charm does not convey any knowledge of the substance of such social influence, or whether it was successful—only that it happened.
