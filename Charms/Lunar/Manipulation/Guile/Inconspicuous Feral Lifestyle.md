Immersing herself in the simple life of a beast, the Lunar falls beneath suspicion. While in an animal shape and undertaking activity characteristic of that species without ulterior motive — singing to attract a mate as a songbird, chasing after vermin as a cat, basking in the sun as a lizard, etc. — she may use Labyrinth of the Beast for only one mote, even against opposing effects that roll no 1s. While using Silver Mask Submersion, the Lunar always enjoys the benefits of this Charm, even if not in animal form or engaging in characteristic behavior.
