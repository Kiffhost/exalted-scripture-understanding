*The sorcerer rubs her hands together. When she draws them apart, a pupating Jealous Heart of Hazeca unsticks from her palms, flying forward to cling to its target.*

The sorcerer flings a dark, sticky blob — a Jealous Heart — at a creature or object within long range requiring a difficulty 3 (Perception + Occult) gambit against enemies. If the gambit fails, the blob falls to the ground. It sticks fast to the first thing it touches other than the ground, bouncing off floors with soft, wet noises.

If the Jealous Heart is affixed to a character, it increases his mobility penalty by 2. If it’s touched by another character or object, they become stuck to it as well, up to a maximum of (Essence + 2) targets. It won’t stick to the sorcerer unless she chooses to allow it.

A stuck character can try to pull themselves free, though not with their bare hands, as can their allies. Doing so is a difficulty 5 feat of strength that requires Strength 5+. However, the Heart will still cling to other people or objects that touch it. The sorcerer can remove it without needing a roll.

The Heart can also be attacked, ending this effect if it’s slain. However, if an attack fails to kill it, the attacker’s weapon becomes stuck to it — or the attacker himself, for unarmed attacks and natural weapons. It has Defense 1, Hardness 4, and seven −0 health levels.

The Heart remains after this spell ends, but loses its supernatural adhesion, only requiring a sharp tug or impact to pull it off.
# Control
Small objects cling gently to the sorcerer’s hands, as does skin, making her touch feel firm and controlling; they count as exceptional equipment for climbing. If the Heart is removed from all stuck targets, she can make a gambit to fling it again without needing to recast this spell.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
The difficulty and Strength minimum to remove the Heart are reduced by two and its Hardness is halved, rounded up.
