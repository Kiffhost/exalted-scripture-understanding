The Solar graces her shot with unerring precision and fires it along a flow of Essence, causing it to slice through the air between the arrow and its mark. Her attack ignores penalties from non-visual conditions such as high winds, bad weather, flawed ammunition, and so on. In addition, her withering attack accuracy is calculated as if it were made from short range regardless of the distance sheâ€™s firing from. With appropriate Awareness Charms, the Solar may use this Charm to make attacks from extreme long range.
