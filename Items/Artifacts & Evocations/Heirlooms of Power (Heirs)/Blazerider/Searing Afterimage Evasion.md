Blazerider’s speed bears its master out of harm’s way, moving faster than the eye can see. Its wielder adds Blazerider’s (Speed Bonus/2, rounded up) to her [[Defense|Evasion]] as a non-Charm bonus.
If [[Racing Flame Method]] is active, the wielder may pay an additional two motes to make a decisive counterattack against an attacker at close range with the flames wreathing [[Blazerider]], using ([[Dexterity]] + [Athletics or Dodge]) for the attack roll.
## Dissonant
The wielder can only make the counterattack if she successfully dodges.
