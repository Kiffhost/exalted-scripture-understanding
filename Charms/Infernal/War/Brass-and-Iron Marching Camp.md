*The Green Sun Prince commands the very flesh of Malfeas to come forth into the world, raising up ramparts of brass and basalt.*

The Infernal rolls to enact a Fortifications stratagem in mid-combat, raising battlements of the Demon City’s architecture. Their difficult terrain applies only to enemy battle groups, not individuals, unless the Infernal wins Join Battle and uses this Charm on her first turn. If she’s already fighting under a Fortifications stratagem, she instead grants allied battle groups the benefits of heavy cover for the scene.

Outside of combat, the Infernal can create a fortified camp that can accommodate up to a Size (higher of Essence or 3) battle group. It has little in the way of amenities, but solid defenses: if an enemy attempts to attack her forces while they’re encamped, they automatically receive the benefits of a Fortifications stratagem. Enemies infiltrating the camp suffer an (Infernal’s Essence) penalty on Stealth rolls.

The battlements crack and crumble the next time the sun dawns or the tomescu cry out in Malfeas, unless the Infernal renews this Charm, waiving its Willpower cost. She need not be present to do so.

The fort normally dissolves within an hour of Creation’s sunrise or the next Tomescu cry, but the Infernal may activate this Charm again to reset the duration, waiving the Willpower cost.

#### Brazen Fortress Conjuration (+5i)
For a five-Initiative surcharge, the difficult terrain from Fortifications applies to all enemies. If the Infernal wins Join Battle and uses this Charm on her first turn, she succeeds automatically on the roll. Outside of combat, she can create a fortress capable of holding up to (Essence/2, rounded up) Size 5 battle groups over the course of ten minutes. Its gates, walls, and other defenses are nigh-impervious, adding (Essence) to the minimum Strength required and their difficulty. The penalty on Stealth rolls subtracts successes instead of dice.
#### From My Dread Keep (Essence 5, [[#Brazen Fortress Conjuration (+5i)|Brazen Fortress Conjuration]]) (+2wp)
Once per story, the Infernal pay an additional two-Willpower surcharge when she uses [[#Brazen Fortress Conjuration (+5i)|Brazen Fortress Conjuration]] outside of combat to create a greater fortress-manse. It’s capable of holding up to (Essence) Size 5 battle groups, and increases the minimum Strength and difficulty of feats of strength by (Essence x 2). The fortress counts as a greater Infernal [[Manse]], and the Infernal recovers an additional point of Willpower when she rests within it. However, it produces no [[Merits/Hearthstone|Hearthstone]]: instead, the Infernal gains the benefits of a [[Merits/Hearthstone|Hearthstone]] suited to her fortress for as long as it stands, chosen when she first uses this Charm. She gains an additional. Characters within the fortress count as having a Minor Tie of terrified awe to her, or treat existing fear-based Ties as one step higher.
