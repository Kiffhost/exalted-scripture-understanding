*Whispering to her weapon of distant lands to her weapon, the Sidereal fills its heart with unquenchable wanderlust.*
The Sidereal’s attack extends its range by one band, maximum long. If the attack roll’s target number is reduced, she extends the attack’s range by two bands instead.
With Thrown 5, Essence 3, the Sidereal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to make it possible to attack at extreme range with this Charm.
