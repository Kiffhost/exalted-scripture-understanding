Rising above the turmoil of the world, the Dragon-Blood dedicates herself to a Defining Principle that represents her ideals. Any character who attempts to either weaken the chosen Principle or cause the Dragon-Blood to act against it must make two separate influence rolls, using the lower result. Additionally, the Dragon-Blood doubles 9s on influence rolls with any Ability to either instill the chosen Principle in others or persuade them to act by appealing to it. If the Dragon-Blood acts against the chosen Principle or voluntarily weakens it in any session where this Charm was used to empower it, she loses all temporary Willpower, and this Charm ends if still active. Likewise, she cannot use it to empower a Principle she’s acted against or weakened earlier in the same session. If influence weakens it below Defining, this Charm ends, but the Dragon-Blood doesn’t lose Willpower. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Defining Principle the Exalt wishes to devote herself to in a way that either fulfills a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) or makes significant narrative progress towards such a goal. If the Dragon-Blood maintains it through multiple stories, she cannot use it again until she’s ended it and either a new story begins or she resets it.
