*The sorcerer condenses her Essence into a core — a supernatural organ that cycles power throughout her spirit, usually taking the form of a glowing mandala or gem over a major chakra.* 
When she stunts her [[Shape Sorcery]] actions to highlight her core, she gains ([[Stunt]] rating + 1) sorcerous motes. Foes can attack the core as a difficulty 4 [[Attack#Gambit|gambit]] with ([[Wits]] + an appropriate combat ability); if they succeed, the sorcerer loses access to this ritual for the rest of the scene.
