*Driven by morbid obsession, the Abyssal surgeon stitches together her magnum opus, an unliving champion greater than the sum of its parts.*
The Abyssal creates a stitched-flesh champion, a masterpiece of her gruesome craft. She can create one from a number of corpses or by modifying one of her corpse-soldiers. Either way, this takes a week of surgery, although each use of Ivory Whirlwind Restoration reduces this to one day. The Abyssal gains a Minor Tie of obsession toward her champion, which cannot be reduced below Minor for as long as the champion remains.
The champion has the traits of a corpse-soldier as well as the following benefits. If it’s created from an existing corpse-soldier, it retains any improvements it’s received.
- Its Essence increases to equal the Abyssal’s, and its Willpower increases to (her Essence + 5).
- The Abyssal’s Caste Mark glows on its brow.
Those familiar with her can recognize her champion as belonging to her with a difficulty 3 (Perception + Occult) roll.
- It loses the Mindless Merit, gaining cognitive faculties comparable to an Intelligence 1 human.
- The Abyssal increases one of its dice pools by four dice and all others by two, maximum fourteen dice.
- All of its static values increase to 5, and the Abyssal may increase one of them to 6. Static values that have already been increased to 5+ with other effects are increased by +1 instead, maximum 7.
- Its soak increases to (Abyssal’s Essence + 10) and it gains Hardness 10.
- It gains (Abyssal’s Essence) −4 health levels.
- It doubles 8s on feats of strength and can attempt Strength 7 feats.
- It can benefit from each of Superior Necrosurgeon Methodology’s effects an additional (Abyssal’s Essence/2) times.
- The Abyssal adds (Essence) to the number of mutations she can grant it with Necrotic Graft Technique. She can use that Charm after a scene of surgical modification to instead exchange that many dots’ worth of mutations for others, which doesn’t count against that Charm’s once-perstory limit.
The Abyssal can only have one champion at a time.
