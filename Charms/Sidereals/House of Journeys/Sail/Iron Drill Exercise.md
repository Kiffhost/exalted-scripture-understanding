The Sidereal sets a formidable example, her every action and command honing her crew’s discipline, seamanship, and expertise. The Sidereal spends a month training a group equivalent to a [[Size]] ([[Charisma]]) battle group (Exalted, p. 206). This regimen consists of ordering that group in the performance of its duties; its members may not even realize they’re learning from her. Completing the training increases the battle group’s [[Drill]] by one step and grants its members the following benefits: 
-  +1 permanent [[Willpower]], maximum 5. 
-  +1 [[Resolve]], maximum 5. 
-  +1 die on [[Sail]]-based dice pools, maximum 10. 
-  +1 die on dice pools based on Ability of the Sidereal’s choice, maximum 10. This Charm can’t train Exalted, player characters, or other beings whose nature makes them inappropriate for inclusion in battle groups. 

## Special activation rules

If the Sidereal trains characters she holds direct authority over, she may use [[Choosing for Fangs]] on them reflexively, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost.
