*The Sidereal meditates on one of the forbidden sigil-syllables sealed away within the Demon Prince Elloge, emptying her mind to remedy that which make her vulnerable.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm after an influence roll against her that’s conveyed through language or a roll against her [[Guile]] while she’s speaking, writing, signing, etc. She inflicts the [[Abandoned Words Curse]] on herself to perfectly defend against the opposing roll. The [[Abandoned Words Curse]] lasts until the story ends. It can resisted with [[Willpower]] or negated with magic as usual. At the Storyteller’s discretion, a stunt may let a character recover a language without needing to spend a point of [[Willpower]], especially if it draws on an [[Intimacy]]. 
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset when the curse is broken prematurely.
