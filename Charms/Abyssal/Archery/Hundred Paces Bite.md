*The Abyssal’s hunger knows no bounds, supping on distant bloodshed.*
When the Abyssal deals damage with a decisive attack, she steals (1 + attack roll extra successes) motes.
She can’t gain more than ([[Dexterity]], [[Perception]], or [[Strength]]) motes per round with this Charm.
Stealing Motes A number of Abyssal [[Charms]] let them steal motes. Motes can only be stolen from characters with mote pools of their own, and the deathknight can’t steel more motes than an enemy has. She may choose whether to drain personal or peripheral motes with such effects, adding them to the same pool she steals from.
