As long as this stone is exposed to the open air, it causes cool breezes to play within two miles. These breezes make hot days more comfortable and particularly blow through windows and ventilation shafts to cool the interiors of warm houses and blow fresh air into cellars and mineshafts.
In the winter these breezes moderate cold temperatures somewhat but also produce cool drafts even in well-sealed houses. If the stone is sealed somewhere airtight, its effects cease until it is again exposed to the open air.
