The Lunar pours her skepticism, bitterness, and fury into a lacuna in her soul, forming a “shadow-mind,” an independent consciousness that lurks within. The shadow-mind has its own Intimacies, chosen when she purchases this Charm: It begins with all the Lunar’s Defining Intimacies and any Tie she has to her Solar mate, but its own unique Major and Minor Intimacies. Because a shadow-mind is born of a Lunar’s darkest impulses, all unique Intimacies assigned when it’s created must be either negative Ties, or Principles rooted in a pessimistic or skeptical worldview. Using this Charm entails four hours of meditation, awakening the shadow-mind (or suppressing it, if it’s already active). The shadow-mind has the same overall identity and memory as the Lunar, but its Intimacies replace hers for as long as it remains active. Its Intimacies can be changed normally, but it gains +1 non-Charm Resolve against instill rolls to create or strengthen positive Ties or Principles rooted in optimism. Likewise, the Lunar is incapable of voluntarily forming or strengthening such Intimacies while the shadow-mind is active.
