*Catching her foe’s limb, the stylist forces it into a painful lock.*
While grappling an opponent, she restrains him (Exalted, p. 201) and rolls ([[Strength]]) dice of unsoakable withering damage. If she’s grappling a crashed foe, restraining him doesn’t cost any rounds of control. 
## Mastery
The martial artist may exchange the [[Initiative]] she receives from [[Joint-Locking Technique]] to gain more rounds of control over the grapple, gaining one round for every two [[Initiative]] she forgoes.
