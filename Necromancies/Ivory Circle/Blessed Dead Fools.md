*In search of lovely and gentle music, the necromancer croons a prayerful melody to the Seven Sighs Requiem, borrowing sublime performers from its soul-menagerie for a night of revels.*
The necromancer must begin her song after nightfall, singing for a few minutes to call forth a band of ancient shades to perform during the night’s revels.
Eccentrically dressed, each musician’s mouth is sown shut with strings of sinew, and each carries an instrument of the necromancer’s choice. They raise a black metal flagpole with a banner of pale blue flame where they set up, visible and enticing to the dead for miles around. The musicians are noncombatants (Exalted, p. 208) and dematerialized, though visible and audible.
Their music has the following effects
- Listeners count as having a Minor Principle of joie de vivre and will join in the night’s revels unless they have a specific reason not to.
- The sublime music makes ghosts feel as if they were alive again and allows them to interact with the living as if they were material.
- Listeners suffer −2 Guile against the necromancer’s guests. The necromancer isn’t affected.
- Those who join in the celebration treat any negative Ties they have towards the necromancer or the undead as one step weaker.
When the next morning comes, trivial revelers can no longer recall the night’s events, as if they were a dream.
Nontrivial characters may roll ({Stamina or Wits} + Integrity) against a difficulty of 3 to recall what happened.
## Control
The sublime performers float on a stage of mist as they play, led by a standard-bearer holding their flag aloft. They become mobile, traveling as a night-parade at the necromancer’s beckoning. The spell’s effects extend out to medium range around the stage.
## Distortion (10)
Distortion causes the performers to become material, rendering them vulnerable to attack.
Should they or their banner be struck, the spell’s effects come to an end.
