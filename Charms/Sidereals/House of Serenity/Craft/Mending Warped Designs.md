The Sidereal mends the scars left by the enemies of fate, restoring the cosmic balance by tending to the wounded and repairing what’s broken. After an hour tending to a patient’s wounds, the Sidereal rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Craft]]). She must have surgical equipment but can substitute tools associated with her [[Craft]] with a stunt. Once her patient’s received a full day’s rest, he heals levels of non-aggravated damage equal to the Sidereal’s success. If her patient’s health track contains any damage inflicted by an enemy of fate (p. XX), he heals instantly instead, her body snapping back to how it was before he was wounded. Alternatively, she can use this Charm to undertake and complete a basic or major repair project in a matter of minutes or a superior or legendary repair project in one week for mundane objects and structures, ([Artifact or Manse] – 1) weeks for artifacts and manses, or (10 – [[Essence]]) weeks for N/A artifacts and manses. If the damage she’s repairing was caused by an enemy of fate, she completes basic and major repairs instantly and superior or legendary repairs in (10 – [[Essence]], minimum 1) hours.
