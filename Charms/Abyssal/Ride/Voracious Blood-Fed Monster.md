*Glutted on blood and fear, the deathknight’s mount finds renewed vigor in slaughter.*
The Abyssal’s mount ignores its wound penalty on a decisive attack roll, adding its base wound penalty in bonus dice instead. If it deals damage to a living enemy, it heals one level of non-aggravated damage or two if the attack incapacitates a nontrivial living enemy. This Charm can be used against spirits and the undead, but not automatons or similar unliving entities.
