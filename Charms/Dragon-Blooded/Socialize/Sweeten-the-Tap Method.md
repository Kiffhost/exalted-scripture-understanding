*Whether it’s freely flowing libations at a Dynastic salon or a ration of rum at a military encampment, alcohol improves moods and eases social friction.*
When the Dragon-Blood supplies drinks, she may use this Charm to heighten their potency and quality. Each character who partakes is treated as having a positive Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] for his fellow partygoers—whose context, such as affection or camaraderie, is chosen by his player — and suffers −1 [[Guile]].
However, sweetening the tap also increases the risk of fraying tempers or violent overreactions. If a character botches a social action, the positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards him created by this Charm inverts into a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] for all inebriated partygoers who witnessed the offense.
