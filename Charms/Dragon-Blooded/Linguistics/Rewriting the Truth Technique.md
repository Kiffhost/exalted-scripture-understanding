The Dragon-Blood pens a seductive deception, her words seeping into the deep channels of the subconscious mind. She rolls (Manipulation + Linguistics) as a written instill action, rerolling 5s and 6s until they cease to appear and ignoring any penalties for making implausible claims (Exalted, p. 215). This influence must target a specific character. If her influence roll beats his Resolve, he forms a Major Principle of belief in the lie unless he pays three Willpower to resist. Attempting to voluntarily weaken the Principle instilled by this Charm costs one Willpower. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by successfully leveraging a character’s Intimacy of belief in a falsehood to persuade him to undertake a serious or life-changing task (Exalted, p. 216) that directly advances the Dragon-Blood’s goals or those of her Hearth.
