*The Abyssal may seem to be injured, even slain, but her wounds are a lie. An instant later, even the most grotesque of injuries are healed.*
When the Abyssal takes decisive damage, she immediately heals one level of damage, plus an additional level for each 1 and 2 on the damage roll. This can’t heal more damage than she was dealt. (She must declare this Charm before an attack roll, as usual).
Against environmental hazards, traps, and the like, she heals all damage — even uncountable damage.
Against recurring uncountable damage, she’s rendered immune for the rest of the scene.
The Abyssal can heal with this Charm even if she’s incapacitated. However, doing so is more strenuous, increasing her wound penalty by three for the next (7 – Stamina) rounds.
This Charm is incompatible with Vault of Undying Triumphs.
