Perceiving the path of living Essence through chakras and meridians, the Immaculate lands a precise strike to disrupt her foe’s vital energies. She adds (Perception) raw withering damage and can make piercing attacks (Exalted, p. 586) with Wood Dragon attacks. In Wood Aura, the Immaculate doesn’t suffer a Defense penalty for making a piercing attack.
