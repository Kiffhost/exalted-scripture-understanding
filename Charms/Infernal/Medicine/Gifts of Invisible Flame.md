*The mad green light of Ligier bathes the world in sickly radiance like an unseen cancer.*

The Infernal infuses an object with the sickly Essence of [[Green Sun Wasting]] (p. XX). A character is exposed to this disease if he spends an hour in close proximity of the object or consumes it. This continues to recur until a nontrivial character fails his roll against infection. If the object is scattered
among others — such as tainting a grain silo or well — the virulence is halved, rounded up. It loses its effect if it’s mixed in with more non-tainted materials than tainted ones.

Characters using magic like [[All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight]] can make a difficulty 3 diagnosis roll to recognize this Charm’s taint.
## [[Keys]]
#### Mad Sun Malison (Essence 3)
The Infernal can commit this Charm’s cost indefinitely to create a lasting taint. It continues spreading infection for as long as this Charm remains active. She can only have one such use active at a time, but can still use this Charm’s base effect to taint other objects.
