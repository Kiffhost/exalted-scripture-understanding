*The deathknight’s familiar partakes of its master’s deathly [[Essence]], the better to serve her dark desires.*
Each purchase of this Charm lets the deathknight grant one of the boons below a familiar she’s enhanced with [[Fetter the Beast]], which she must spend this Charm’s training time working with. Some boons have [[Survival]] or [[Essence]] minimums, or require the familiar to have one or more other boons. Boons that increase a familiar’s traits can’t raise dice pools above 14 dice or static values above 12.
Cadaver-Beast Thews: The familiar adds two dice on feats of strength and rolls against poison and disease. It gains +1 soak and adds +1 to the base damage of its withering attacks.
Dread Predator Alacrity: The familiar adds two dice on attack rolls and movement actions, and gains +1 [[Defense|Parry]].
Lurking Horror Refinement: The familiar adds two dice on [[Perception]] rolls and [[Stealth]] rolls, and gains +1 [[Defense|Evasion]].
Carrion-Eater’s Wisdom ([[Survival]] 5; One boon): The familiar gains human-level intelligence and learns all languages the Abyssal knows, though it can only speak them if its anatomy allows. It gains +1 permanent [[Willpower]], [[Guile]], and [[Resolve]], and gains dix-die pools for Diagnosing Ailments, [[Investigation]], [[Read Intentions]], and Strategy.
Corpse-Hide Resilience ([[Survival]] 5; One boon): The familiar gains +3 soak and +1 [[Hardness]]. The Abyssal can purchase this benefit up to ([[Essence]]) times for each familiar.
Endurance Beyond Extinction ([[Survival]] 5; One boon): The familiar gains an additional −1 health level and two −2 levels. The Abyssal can purchase this benefit up to ([[Essence]]) times for each familiar.
Wretched Abomination Form ([[Survival]] 5; One boon) The familiar gains five dots of mutations. The Abyssal can purchase this benefit up to ([[Essence]]) times for each familiar.
Unholy Beast of Slaughter ([[Survival]] 5, [[Essence]] 3; Two boons): Whenever the Abyssal gains [[Initiative]] from a withering damage roll, the familiar gains half that much [[Initiative]], rounded up, maximum (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]). To receive this benefit, the familiar must already have at least two others.
