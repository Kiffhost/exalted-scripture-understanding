No story of Dancing Mockingbird would be complete without the Oud of Infinite Strings — for what is any musician without her instrument? The Changing Moon joined the Silver Pact soon after his Exaltation, but cared not for its vendetta. In those days, he was ruled by pride and avarice, plundering the vaults of Creation’s wealthiest merchants, scavenger princes, and queens.
The oud was created by Quan Sinh Bao as a bribe for Dancing Mockingbird, for the No Moon had need of the thief’s skills to recover a sacred treasure of her people, the Tengese, from the Scarlet Dynasty. She carved the oud’s body from the burgundy wood of the Forest of Liars, a bordermarch where plants grow by deceit. Its moonsilver strings are so many and so fine that they can’t be counted with the naked eye, lending the artifact its name.
Impressed by Bao’s artifice and the power he could feel in the oud’s strings, Dancing Mockingbird dared the treasure-manse of the sorcerer Ragara Ori. He won back the relic that Bao had sought for An-Teng, along with a considerable sum of other treasures. From then on, the oud accompanied Mockingbird on every heist, from stealing the Garda’s Heart diamond to robbing the Guild Directorate’s headquarters in Nexus.
In time, Dancing Mockingbird grew jaded to the pursuit of riches. Instead, he turned his efforts to mentoring the Pact’s recruits, mending rifts between its members, and courting Bao. Now a respected shahan-ya, he entrusts the oud to those he thinks might put it to good use — or at least, interesting use. 
 
## Evocations of the Oud of Infinite Strings

The Oud of Infinite Strings’ Evocations aid its player in deception and subterfuge, lulling those who hear its music into complacency.
The oud is an exceptional instrument (Exalted, p. 580).
It’s also exceptional equipment for Larceny and Stealth rolls the musician makes opposing characters listening to the oud’s music. (The musician can take such actions while performing by flurrying.) A Lunar musician can use Performance instead of the usual Ability for any Manipulation-based influence roll she makes or enhances with a Lunar Charm. She can’t rely on music alone, though — she must talk to her targets as or after she performs.
