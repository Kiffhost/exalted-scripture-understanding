*When the Lawgiver draws her blade in defense of another, her charge becomes nigh untouchable.*
When using [[War Lion Stance]] to defend another, the Exalt may use this Charm to make her charge an inapplicable target. All incoming attacks must target her until her next turn. During this time, if her defense is penetrated, her charge cannot be attacked. At [[Essence]] 3+, the Exalt may even defend her charge from sufficiently large sources of damage such as explosions with a stunt.
