Closing her eyes to the world around her, the Sidereal strikes where fate decrees she must. The Sidereal aims reflexively before rolling an attack against an enemy within medium range and ignores penalties from blindness and visual conditions. This counts as a turn spent aiming for all purposes. If he’s at close range, this Charm’s Willpower cost is waived.
