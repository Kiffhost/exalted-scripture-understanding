Bitter Night’s Fury was among the greatest hunters and monster-slayers of the First Age. Born too late to have fought in the Divine Revolution, her elder Circlemates’ tales of battle against the enemies of the gods inspired the young Lunar to test herself against the countless terrors that still threatened the still-young Old Realm.
Ekaterina of the Unhinging Jaw, who was Fury’s Circlemate and the lover of her past incarnation, forged the Hungering Fangs as a gift for her before her first hunt. Armed with the moonsilver blades, Fury slew her quarry, the Miasma of Tongues — the first of many horrors to fall to her and her daiklaves.
In the end, it was love that undid Fury. When not on the hunt, she spent her days with her Solar mate, the soft-spoken sorcerer Lysander the Aureate Rose. But when she returned from her pursuit of the Catechism Moth, she found her beloved had changed. Lysander had called forth the demon Kalojan, a great thief of faces, and its power defied his words of binding. Overcome with terrible rage, Fury sought out the demon alone, too consumed by her rage to warn others or request aid.
The fangs struck true, nearly claiming the demon’s life — but Kalojan wore Lysander’s face, and Fury hesitated just a split-second too long.
Wearing Lysander and Fury’s stolen faces, Kalojan infiltrated the Old Realm’s Deliberative, sowing much chaos among its ranks for a time — though it eventually acquired both a talent and a passion for lawmaking.
But Ekaterina had loved Fury in two lives — as she met the demon’s eyes, she knew they weren’t those of her Circlemate. Rallying both her own Circle and fallen Lysander’s, Ekaterina exposed the demon’s intrigues and gave it over to the torments suited to its crimes.
The Hungering Fangs were passed down to Fury’s reincarnation, Iryero Who-Breaks-The-Line, but a hunter’s weapons were poorly suited to that ever-ambitious general. Instead, he used them to win the favor of the behemoth-slayer Advor Tideturner, who would later wield the daiklaves against the greatest prey of all in the Usurpation. They were a prized heirloom of Gens Advor in the Shogunate’s early days, but were reclaimed by the Silver Pact after the Battle of Glass Rivers.
The Hungering Fangs are of unconventional design.
Their hilts are perpendicular to their blades, not parallel as most are. They’re held so that the blades face backward, requiring them to be wielded more like tonfas than swords. The hearthstone sockets on each daiklave’s hilt are edged with star sapphires, said to have reminded Ekaterina of her beloved’s eyes. 
 
## Evocations of the Hungering Fangs

The Hungering Fangs feed upon the power of mighty foes, stealing their prowess and power for the blades’ wielder.
They also reveal foes’ secrets, that they might never fail another wielder as they failed Bitter Night’s Fury.
The daiklaves gain +1 Accuracy and +1 Overwhelming against enemies with Essence 5+. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this may also apply against behemoths or other uniquely powered beings even if they have lower Essence ratings.
