*The Sidereal sketches out the fate of a potential relationship and sets it in motion, increasing the power someone holds over another.*
The Sidereal makes a special (Manipulation + Socialize) instill roll against a single target, choosing someone he knows and a method by which that person could gain power over him — fear, desire, obligation, etc. Success instills a Tie toward the character placed in control with an appropriate emotional context, which can’t be resisted with Willpower. The Sidereal is never perceived as the source of this influence.
At the end of each scene in which the two interact, the Tie is strengthened by one step (or reforms at Minor if it’s been fully eroded). The victim can pay one Willpower to avoid having this Tie strengthened or created. This Charm ends once he’s spent (Sidereal’s Essence) Willpower this way.
