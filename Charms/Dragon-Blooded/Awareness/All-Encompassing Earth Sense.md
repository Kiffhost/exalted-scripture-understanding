The Dragon-Blood can sense the vibrations that move through the earth when a soldier takes a step or a leaf falls from a branch. When she comes within short range of a hidden enemy or danger, she rolls (Perception + Awareness) with double 9s to detect it. In order for her to perceive concealed characters, they must be standing on the same surface that she stands on, or no more than one vertical range band up on structures or scenery that rest on that surface (such as the roof beams of a low ceiling or the understory of a forest). She cannot sense enemies who are airborne, in or on water, or taking other measures to avoid moving across a solid surface. If she fails her initial roll, she may reactivate this Charm once per subsequent round to detect the same threat. With Awareness 4, Essence 2, the Dragon-Blood may purchase elemental variants of this effect for three experience points each. Air: The Dragon-Blood can sense hidden threats through air motion out to close range while in an enclosed space such as a room. This extends to short range at Awareness 5, Essence 5. Fire: The Dragon-Blood can sense hidden threats out to long range while both are standing in a fire, a burning building, or similar circumstances, sensing their cooler temperature against the heat of the flames. Water:Whilesubmergedinwater,theDragon-Bloodcan sense hidden threats that are at least partially immersed out to medium range. In driving rain or similar weather, she can sense hidden characters out to short range. Wood: While in undergrowth, foliage, or similar vegetative terrain, the Dragon-Blood may sense hidden threats in the same terrain out to short range. This extends to medium range at Awareness 5, Essence 5.
