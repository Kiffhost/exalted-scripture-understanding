As their blades rebound from [[Penumbra Gleam]], enemies are assailed by thoughts of failure. Upon successfully blocking an attack, the wielder makes a special counterattack, rolling ([[Perception]] + [[Melee]]) against the attacker’s [[Resolve]]. If successful, he suffers a −3 penalty on rolls against the wielder that scene and forms a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of self-loathing. He can spend [[Willpower]] to resist the [[Intimacy|Tie]], but not the penalty. 

## Resonant

The wielder adds non-Charm dice on her counterattack equal to the difference between the enemy’s attack roll and her [[Defense|Parry]].
