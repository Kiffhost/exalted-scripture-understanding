*Implacable fury suffuses the stylist’s body with monstrous strength, sending her flying from quarry to quarry in a blur of carnage.*
The stylist leaps up to one range band horizontally or two bands vertically at an enemy, then makes ([[Essence]]) decisive attacks against him, or (Essence + 1) if he was at close range. If she has a relevant [[Intimacy]] of primal emotion, she can substitute ([[Intimacy]]) for her [[Essence]] if it’s higher. She can increase the jump’s range by sacrificing attacks, adding one range band per attack, maximum three bands.
The stylist’s [[Initiative]] is divided evenly among all attacks, rounded up. It doesn’t reset until the final attack is completed, assuming at least one hits. She doesn’t lose Initiative for missed attacks unless all of them miss.
If the stylist incapacitates her target and has any attacks remaining, she may leap up to one range band in any direction and make any remaining attacks against a new enemy. She can expand this jump’s range as above.
This Charm uses the stylist’s [[movement]] action for the round. If she falls after completing her attacks, she treats it as one range band shorter to determine how much falling damage she suffers (Exalted, p. 232).
## Mastery
With [[Essence]] 3, the stylist can change targets between attacks even if she doesn’t incapacitate her current enemy.
## Terrestrial
The stylist subtracts one from the total number of attacks she can make, and rounds down when dividing Initiative among attacks.
