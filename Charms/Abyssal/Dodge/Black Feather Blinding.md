*A cloud of dark feathers bursts from the Abyssal, concealing her within the swirling storm.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after dodging an attack, unleashing a whirlwind of black feathers that extends out to short range until her next turn. Enemies caught within it suffer a −2 penalty on vision-dependent rolls, which increases to −3 on attacks against the Abyssal.
With a Dodge 5, Essence 2 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to extend the whirling feathers out to medium range. The buffeting feathers inflict their penalty on all physical actions. Enemies lose one Initiative each time they move into or within the feathers and at the end of each round.
