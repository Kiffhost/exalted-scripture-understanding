One of the most versatile and simple weapons ever produced, the spear is a foot-long head attached to the end of a five- to six-foot-long pole. The head of the spear typically has extensions built into the sides to prevent it from going too deep into a target. Spears are inexpensive and effective and, as a result, are one of the most common armaments of soldiers everywhere.
