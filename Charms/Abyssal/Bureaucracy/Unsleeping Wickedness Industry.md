*Unmatched in her foreplanning, the Abyssal relies on her servants to fulfill her will at the moment when it matters most.*
As the Abyssal spends a scene tending to the business of an organization she leads or otherwise engaging with the group, her player retroactively reveals that an organization led by her has completed a project off-scene (Exalted, 226). As usual, the project must be feasible to the organization’s nature and resources. For example, a trade consortium could corner a market, organize a caravan with a mercenary escort, or arrange a large loan, but would struggle to revise laws, repair a city’s walls, or raise a militia.
