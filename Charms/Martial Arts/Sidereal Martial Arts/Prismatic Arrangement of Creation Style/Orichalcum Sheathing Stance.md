Golden Essence limns the stylist’s skin, girding her with orichalcum’s invincibility. The stylist can use this Charm after an attack roll against her to gain (Essence + [Lore or Occult]) armored soak against a withering attack or (Essence + [Lore or Occult]) Hardness against a decisive attack. If she doesn’t take damage, she channels the attack’s force inward, gaining motes equal to the attack roll’s 10s, maximum (Essence).
