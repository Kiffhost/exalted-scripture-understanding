*Plucking one of her own eyes from its socket, the sorcerer casts it into the sky with the Recitation of the Ninth Horizon. Her prayer blasphemes against Heaven and Hell alike as, for an instant, a fragment of Sacheverell stirs in its slumbering durance.*

Clouds gather overhead, parting at the centre to reveal a colossal version of the sorcerer’s eye, visible for (Essence x 10) miles. She may reflexively shift her sight between her own perspective and the eye’s. While inhabiting the eye, she can perceive anything within (Essence x 10) miles, ignoring all penalties for mundane obstructions like smoke, crowds, and the like. She adds five dice on all vision-based Awareness rolls made from this vantage. Onlookers can’t determine what the eye is looking at specifically through observation, but a difficulty 5 (Perception + Occult) roll lets a character sense whether it’s regarding them for the scene.

The sorcerer also gains the following powers:
- **Phosphorescent Gaze** (10m, 1wp; Simple; One day): The eye shines with merciless white light, casting all under its gaze into oppressive day. All characters other than the sorcerer within the eye’s range suffer a −2 penalty on vision-based actions. The light seeps through even the slightest openings, even the spaces between mortared bricks. Sleep is impossible unless this light is fully blocked out.
- **Wall-Piercing Sight** (15m, 1wp; Simple; One tick): The eye’s pupil becomes shifting and fluid, capable of seeing through solid matter. Only the most dramatic barriers pose any obstruction, such as buildings with many floors, deep caverns or catacombs, fortified structures, or First Age ruins. Such impediments impose a −2 penalty, potentially rising to −5 for the most extreme examples.

Attacking the eye is possible but difficult, as it’s suspended at extreme range above the ground. The Storyteller determines exactly how many range bands this is, but range-enhancing magic will almost be required. It has (sorcerer’s Perception) Defense and fifteen −0 health levels. It can’t take more than a single level of damage from an attack unless the attacker has Legendary Size, though this doesn’t apply against uncountable damage. If destroyed, it deflates slowly, raining down a typhoon of vitreous fluid. Otherwise, the sorcerer’s eye returns at the end of spell, bloodshot but unharmed.
# Control
A phantasmal eye orbits the sorcerer’s head, allowing her to see in all directions at once. She may will it to fly up to long range from her, seeing through it perfectly. In combat, she can reflexively move it one range band on each of her turns. If she attempts to conceal the eye, she suffers a −1 penalty to vision-based rolls.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 20)
A rival sorcerer may blind the eye to a region that extends out to (his Essence/2, rounded up) range bands from a chosen point within long range of him. The caster can notice the blind spot with a (Perception + Awareness) roll at a difficulty of (distorting sorcerer’s Wits), but can’t see what’s within it.
