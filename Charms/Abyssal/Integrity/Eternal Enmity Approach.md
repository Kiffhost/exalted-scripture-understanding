*The Abyssal draws strength from her hatred, implacable in the face of those she has named her enemies.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, she chooses one of her negative Defining Intimacies. It can’t be weakened by any means, other than her voluntarily doing so, and any influence that would cause her to act against it is unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220).
Characters can attempt to undermine this Charm’s defense with a special instill roll, rolling twice and taking the lower result. The cost of any magic that enhances either roll must be paid separately. If successful, the chosen [[Intimacy]] loses this Charm’s protection until the Abyssal gains [[Willpower]] from upholding it.
If the Abyssal voluntarily weakens the enhanced [[Intimacy]], it likewise loses this Charm’s protection until she raises it back to Defining intensity. Alternatively, she can choose another of her valid Intimacies to apply his Charm to.
An [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Abyssal choose a second [[Intimacy]] for this Charm.
