Words written in stone aren’t easily disobeyed. The Dragon-Blood imposes a binding edict, engraved onto a stone tablet or monument, upon an organization that she either leads or holds rulemaking authority within. The rule she imposes must be a singular task or requirement, and must be related to that group’s bureaucratic function. The prohibition or requirement carves out a place in the memories of the organization’s members. When a character is faced with the prospect of breaking the rule, it becomes an overwhelming duty, forcing him to comply unless he enters a Decision Point and calls on a Defining [[Intimacy]] to spend one [[Willpower]] resisting this influence. Once a character has resisted, he’s freed from the compulsion to obey that particular rule. Characters may also disobey the rule if they resign or otherwise formally leave the group. The promulgation of harmonious rules with this Charm fortifies a bureaucracy against the influence of the Wyld. Any member of an organization acting in his official capacity is treated as wielding or touching iron so long as he abides by the Dragon-Blood’s edict.
