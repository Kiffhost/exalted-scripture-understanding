Hunger thrums through the Hundred Rings as they stretch toward their prey. The wielder makes a grapple gambit against an enemy within medium range, adding (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on the control roll. If successful, the grappled foe remains in place. The wielder’s drag actions only cost one round of control, and she can pull him a range band toward herself even if she doesn’t take a move action. Alternatively, the wielder can extend the Hundred Rings up to 30 feet long for other purposes — providing a line to swing from, anchoring a ship, creating a tripwire to snare a behemoth, etc. Waive such uses’ [[Willpower]] cost.
