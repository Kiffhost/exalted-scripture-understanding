Feeling the pulse of energy that moves through the world, the Solar can sense her exact position on any body of water. As long as she is on the deck of a ship, and that ship is touching a body of water, the Exalt can sense both the direction of the Pole of Earth and the North Star, even in broad daylight. The moment she uses this Charm, she knows her exact latitude, longitude, and bearing, and can plot an accurate course without a roll.

### On [[Perfect Reckoning Technique]]

Originally this Charm was in the core rules, but I changed that Charm’s name to [[Safe Bearing Technique]] in order to have a more powerful version of this classic Solar Charm. Because Creation is flat, getting latitude and longitude works differently. It requires charts that map the course of the sun at certain dates and times of the day, and the use of a backstaff to measure the sun’s angle and distance from the horizon. This is a difficulty 3 roll for those who have been trained (Celestial Navigation specialty in [[Sail]]), difficulty 4 for those who have not. Without charts and a backstaff, the difficulty is raised by 2. A Solar with this Charm always knows her position relevant to the sun’s arc even at night, and she can see through sunlight to the North Star even by day. The reason this Charm requires her to be on a ship atop a body of water is because she is “feeling” along the greater surface area of her submerged hull to sense the flow of Water [[Essence]]. All bodies of water in Creation, even the Dreaming Sea, are resonant with the Pole of Earth — if one can feel along the [[Essence]] that flows through oceans and rivers, one’s sense will inevitably be pulled toward the Pole of Earth. Thus a Solar standing on a ship, floating on water, needs no jade magnet needle to know the direction of the Imperial Mountain in relation to the North.
