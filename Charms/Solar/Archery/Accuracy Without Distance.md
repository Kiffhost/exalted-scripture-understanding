*The Solar extends her anima through her hands and into her weapons, joining archer, target and arrow into a single being.*
As long as she is making an [[Archery]]-based attack, this Charm allows the Solar to complete an aim action instantly, and converts the subsequent three bonus dice into automatic non-Charm successes.
An [[Essence]] 5+ repurchase allows the Solar to fire a withering version of this attack against a crashed opponent. This attack rolls damage even if the attack roll generated no successes. This effect may only be used on a target once per crash period.
