*The Infernal provides for her faithful, beckoning forth Hell’s bounty in abundance.*

The Infernal creates a spawning pit of demon locusts. The ground around her cracks and crumbles as the pit opens over the course of an hour, tearing slabs of rock into pebbles and then into finest dust. Demon locusts like those created by [[Locust Manna Plague]] constantly swarm from the pit, dying in multitudes around it. This bounty can sustain a population of almost any size with appropriate distribution, limited only by distance. If a locust is taken more than (Infernal’s Essence) miles from the spawning pit, it crumbles into dust.

The spawning pit stays open for a month. In desolate regions, it stays until the end of the next Calibration.
## [[Keys]]
#### Locusts and Honey Paradise (Essence 4) (+20m, 2wp)
The Infernal can pay a twenty-mote, two-Willpower surcharge to create a permanent spawning pit. She can only have (Essence + Charisma + Wits) of them at a time. Permanent spawning pits created outside of desolate terrain count as two pits toward this limit.
#### From Desolation, Life (Essence 5)
The Infernal may cast a First Circle demon into a spawning pit as she uses this Charm, destroying it utterly as its flesh and Essence are devoured by the pit. Each night at midnight, a demon of the same kind emerges from the pit, coming into existence without any motes or Willpower. It has no Intimacies or innate loyalty to the Infernal, acting as a typical demon of its kind would. If the Infernal has [[Swallowing the Scorpion]] (p. XX), these demons may take on an altered form that reflects her nature more than that of the demon’s progenitor.
