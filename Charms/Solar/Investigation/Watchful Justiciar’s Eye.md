The Solar is able to sense inconsistencies in a character’s behavior. After profiling a character with the prerequisite or [[Ten Magistrate Eyes]], the Solar senses each time a character acts outside of that profile in a scene. She may then pay four motes, one [[Willpower]] to activate this Charm. The Storyteller then informs the player as to whether the character’s behavior is normal, allowing the Solar to revise her target’s profile and restoring one point of temporary [[Willpower]], or whether the inconsistency is genuinely odd and worth looking into. This does not tell the Lawgiver why he’s acting out of character, only that he is. The Storyteller should explain the dissonance in the character’s behavior—how the character “should” be acting compared to how he’s actually behaving.
