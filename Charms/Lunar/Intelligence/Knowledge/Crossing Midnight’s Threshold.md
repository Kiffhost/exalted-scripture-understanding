*The Lunar blurs the boundaries between her mind and the world, thoughts and memories spilling out to form a dream-realm around her.*
To use this Charm, the Lunar must be meditating or engaged in a slow continuous activity — performing, crafting, writing, reading, etc. As long as she continues to do so, she can manifest phantasmal imagery out to medium range, and project her memories — or those stolen with [[Memory-Drinking Meditation]] — into the world. Very old or muddled memories may require an ([[Intelligence]] + {Integrity or Lore}). These images are obviously illusionary to those who perceive them, and are exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) on rolls that benefit from them.
By examining her memories from the outside, the Lunar and others can make [[Awareness]] and [[Investigation]] rolls to find things that the Lunar didn’t consciously recognize before. Additionally, she can use appropriate Crafts to give her memories permanent form: carving her memory of a statue into reality as a forgery of the original, mixing memories of someone into paint to create a portrait that displays glimpses of mystery, or weaving tapestries from her dreams. She can’t turn memories into raw materials, including the magical materials, though she could incorporate them into artifacts.
If the Lunar uses [[Secure Den Technique]] (Lunars, p. 292), she can use this Charm reflexively to make the den a permanent dream-realm. While in the den, she always receives this Charm’s benefits without needing to meditate, and its range encompasses the entire den. She can leave phantasmal images that will linger indefinitely after she leaves the den.
If the Lunar has [[Many-Pockets Meditation]] (Lunars, p. 290), she can use it to store her belongings within the dream-realm when this Charm ends, letting her recall them when she uses it again. A single use of ManyPockets Meditation banishes all qualifying mundane objects, but the Lunar can’t end her mote commitment until she reuses this Charm.
If the Lunar uses [[Dream-Delving Voyage]] (Lunars, p. 246), she can use this Charm reflexively to display her target’s dreams to onlookers if she succeeds.
