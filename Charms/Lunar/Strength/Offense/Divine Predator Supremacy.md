Sensing her foe’s weakness, the Lunar’s world narrows to a path leading from her to her prey. She makes a withering attack, adding non-Charm dice equal to her enemy’s wound penalty on the attack roll. She doubles 9s on the damage roll if he suffers a −1 wound penalty, doubles 8s if he has a −2 wound penalty, and doubles 7s if he has a −4 wound penalty. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a crashed enemy.
