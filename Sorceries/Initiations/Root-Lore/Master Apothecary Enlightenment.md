Successfully introducing a fact about herbs or treating a patient using herbal medicine awards the sorcerer (Intelligence + extra successes) sorcerous motes, which last until the story ends. Completing a basic or major crafting project to create a medicine, drug, poison, etc. from plants grants (Intelligence + silver points awarded + {gold points awarded x 2}) sorcerous motes, which last until the story ends. The sorcerer can only have sorcerous motes from one use of this ritual at a time; to accept more, she loses any from previous uses.
