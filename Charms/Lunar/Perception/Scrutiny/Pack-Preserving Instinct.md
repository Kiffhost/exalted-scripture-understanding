A devoted sentinel, the Lunar sees to the safety of those closest to her heart. When she perceives her Solar mate or a character she has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward in circumstances where certain [[Perception]] [[Charms]] could benefit him, she can use those [[Charms]] to enhance his rolls by warning him, paying a twomote surcharge on each. Valid [[Charms]] are [[Ever-Wary Fox Technique]], [[Observed Prey Instinct]], [[Secret Sense Intuition]], [[Veil-Rending Scrutiny]], and [[Worry the Bone]].
