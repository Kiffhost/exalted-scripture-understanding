*Sensing fatal peril to its charge, Second Sister gives everything it has left.*

This Evocation can only be used if Second Sister’s health track has been filled with damage and it suffers an injury from using [[Sister’s Suffering]]. The wearer can use it after a decisive attack roll, before the damage roll. Her anima abruptly gutters out, fading to dim, as she falls through her own shadow and vanishes. She perfectly defends against the attack, reappearing in a safe place nearby that’s in total darkness, like a cave or cellar, chosen by the Storyteller. In Malfeas, she invariably reappears at Alveua’s Forge of Night.

Using this Evocation leaves Second Sister riven and cracked, rendering it and its Evocations unusable until it’s repaired with a superior repair project.
### Resonant
Only a character resonant with Second Sister can awaken this Evocation.
## Reset
Once per story.
