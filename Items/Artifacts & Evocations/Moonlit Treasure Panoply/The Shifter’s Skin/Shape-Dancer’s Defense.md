The Lunar evades harm with a well-timed transformation, ducking beneath a blow as she shrinks into a cat or fending off blades with an elk’s antlers.
The Lunar can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to activate Quicksilver Second Face after an attack roll against her.
## Resonant
The Lunar may waive the surcharge once per day.
