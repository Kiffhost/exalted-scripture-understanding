*The Ichneumon Blades’ progeny hatch in a gruesome display, extending countless spines that pierce their host from within.* 
After her withering attack crashes an enemy with any embedded splinters, she can use this Evocation to roll (splinters + damage roll 10s) dice of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. The impaling spines remain extended, imposing a −1 mobility penalty (Exalted, p. 591) as long as any remain. Moreover, any subsequent splinters the wielder inflicts on the victim instantly blossom into spines, rolling one die of Hardness-ignoring damage. This lasts until all transformed splinters have been removed. Extracting transformed splinters is far more difficult than usual. The surgery is rolled at difficulty 5, suffers a −4 penalty if not enhanced by magic, and takes a day to complete. 
Once this Evocation is used against a character, it can’t be used against him again until all splinters have been extracted from him.
