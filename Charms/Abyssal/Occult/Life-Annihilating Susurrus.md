*The Abyssal makes herself a vessel for the agonizing deathwail of the Neverborn, which emerges from her lips as a radiating broadcast of psychic agony that grinds life into dust.*
The Abyssal can pay a ten-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses God-Scourging Wail to unleash an apocalyptic howl, extending the Charm’s duration to one scene. On each subsequent turn, she can repeat the attack, using her initial attack roll rather than making a new one. This can’t be flurried. Her Initiative isn’t included in the damage of these subsequent attacks, nor do they reset her to base. Once an enemy is damaged by one of these attacks, he can’t use his Resolve to defend against subsequent attacks unless he pays one Willpower per attack.
Once the Abyssal has made two consecutive attacks, the range of subsequent attacks increases by one band each time she makes one, extending into extreme range. This can’t extend beyond (Essence) miles, though by this point, the devastation wrought by the Abyssal’s power is largely a narrative matter left to the Storyteller’s discretion.
The susurrus ends if the Abyssal goes a turn without repeating the attack or if she’s incapacitated.
