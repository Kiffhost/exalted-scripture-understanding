*The Exalt shows only what she wishes to be seen.*
Discarding all other facets, she becomes a continuous unity of form. This Charm upgrades its prerequisite, replacing the cost and allowing the Exalt to disguise herself as a specific person without suffering a penalty for impersonating a specific character, or for changing her body type significantly. In addition to the bonuses associated with Flawlessly Impenetrable [[Disguise]], it also adds ([[Essence]]) nonCharm successes to the roll to establish the disguise. The impersonation is perfect. It cannot be pierced by mundane or inhuman sensory acuity. Characters are not entitled to attempt to see through the disguise unless the Solar behaves in a grossly inaccurate way. Even so, a witness using [[Charms]] or other magic to penetrate the disguise suffer a -4 dice penalty to do so. In addition, should he fail at this attempt, his next attempt suffers an additional -1. This penalty cannot exceed -5. In addition to these effects, the Exalt may adapt [[Essence]] based visual dynamics not covered by simple makeup or disguise. Her hair might stand on end and crackle with lightning; she might hover inches off the ground or display the anima of a different kind of Exalt. None of these displays are real. That is, displaying a Fire Aspect’s anima will not actually burn anything, though witnesses will feel the intensity of its heat. She may appear to float, but her feet are still touching the ground.
