*Gentle masters write their lessons in bruises, not wounds.* 
[[Kindly Sifu’s Quill]] applies the double 10s rule to a decisive damage roll, and causes decisive attacks to always deal bashing damage. An enemy who has an [[Intimacy]] as described in [[Humbling Enlightenment Commentary]] takes a penalty to his [[Defense]] against the attack as though it were his [[Resolve]], as long as the attack is stunted in a way that includes dialogue or actions that exploit this vulnerability. 
## Mastery
At [[Essence]] 3+, exploiting an [[Intimacy]] improves the damage bonus of this Charm based on the Intimacy’s rating: Double 9s if it is Minor, 8s if it is Major, and 7s if it is Defining.
