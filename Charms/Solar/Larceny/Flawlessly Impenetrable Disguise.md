Master chameleons, the Solars donned disguises and attended the fetes of the raksha, to hear them confess their nefarious plans for Creation. This Charm recreates a disguise attempt (see p. 224), but allows the Exalt to make a myriad of extraordinary changes to her appearance. She may change her gender, double her age or halve it, alter her height by ten inches in either direction, change her ethnicity, adjust her voice and alter her accent. She can even change her scent. The Solar gains two automatic successes to her disguise attempt, ignores penalties for adapting a different race or gender, and gains double 9s. This disguise cannot be pierced by mundane senses. Nor can it be thwarted by inhuman sensory acuity, such as the nose of a hound or the eye of a hawk. Senses heightened to supernatural levels by Charms such as Keen Sight Discipline have a chance to pierce this deception, but subtract 2 successes from their attempts. Magic which pierces this effect does not reveal the Solar’s identity, only that the Exalt is not what she appears to be. Typically Solars used this Charm to hide their identities or to appeal to specific criteria such as “Only women are allowed into the sept.” However, should it be used to impersonate a specific character, magic which pierces this effect will only reveal the apparent body double of the Charm’s subject. For example, if the Solar disguises herself as the Scarlet Empress, magic which pierces her disguise will see her as a tall, porcelain-skinned red-haired woman with cunningly accurate makeup, as opposed to what the Solar actually looks like.
