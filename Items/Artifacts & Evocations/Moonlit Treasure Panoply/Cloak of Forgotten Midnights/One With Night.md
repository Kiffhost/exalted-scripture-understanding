The night keeps no secrets from the cloak’s wearer.
The cloak’s wearer ignores vision-based penalties from poor lighting, unimpeded even by total darkness — including magical darkness. When she makes a Shape Sorcery roll in such conditions, she adds bonus dice equal to the darkness’ penalty.
## Resonant
The bonus dice are non-Charm when casting her control spell.
