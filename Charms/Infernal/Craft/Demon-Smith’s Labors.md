*The Infernal overflows with hellish inspiration, born of fury at the sins of Creation and awe at the wonders of Hell.*

The Infernal gains craft points as though she’d completed a [[Basic Project|basic project]] (Exalted, p. 240) when she:
- Uses something that she’s created to right a perceived wrong.
- Uses something that she’s created to advance the interest of a demon, a Yozi, or Hell as a whole.
- Introduces a fact related to one of her Crafts or challenges such a fact.
- Obtains exotic materials or wonders of the Demon City, or similar otherworldly substances useful to the Infernal’s craft.
