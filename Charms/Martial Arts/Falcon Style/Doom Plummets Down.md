Raking Talon Kick, Talons Greet Prey The stylist executes a signature finishing move that expresses her ferocious spirit in an unbelievable display of speed and power, flinging her foe to the ground before dealing the final blow. To use this Charm, she must have 5+ rounds of control over a grapple. After throwing an enemy into a hard surface, she lunges toward him and reflexively makes a decisive attack. Any stunt bonus awarded is also added to the damage roll, and if the throw was decisive, her Initiative doesn’t reset until after this attack. She can activate Raking Talon Kick reflexively to enhance it. If the stylist threw her enemy beyond close range using Neck-Piercing Hook or a similar effect, she leaps into close range with him before attacking. This counts as her movement action. 
## Mastery

If the stylist hits, she may reflexively rush the struck enemy or disengage from him with a leap, automatically succeeding on the roll. This doesn’t count as her movement action.

Laughing Monster Style The fae warrior-saints of the Court of Flayed Sinners distilled Laughing Monster style from the digested dreams of countless thieves, scavenger princes, and oathbreakers drawn by rumors of the unimaginable treasures they guarded. This reign of false virtue was ended by the shaman Juven Fifth-Summer, who tore off the face of the court’s prince and coaxed the style’s secrets from his ragged lips, using them to set the raksha against each other until none remained. Laughing Monster style epitomizes impetuosity and wicked humor, employing misdirection and confusion to humiliate rivals with inordinate glee. Its stylists practice erratic breathing exercises, rolling dance-steps, and ego-destroying meditations to fully understand its secrets. It has spread to numerous dojos, secret societies, and criminal syndicates. It’s regarded as a style of thieves, revolutionaries, madmen, and all manner of trickster-heroes, as unpredictable as any devil born of the Wyld. Laughing Monster Weapons: Laughing Monster style uses open-handed slaps, elbow strikes, and sweeping kicks. It also employs the staff, war fan, and whip. Unarmed attacks enhanced with Laughing Monster Charms can be stunted to deal lethal damage. Armor: Laughing Monster is incompatible with armor. Complementary Abilities: Laughing Monster’s evasive footwork relies on Dodge, while Presence or Socialize are useful for its trickery. Its students value Occult, for they delve into obscure, worrisome practices.
