*The awful fires of the Infernal’s will do not gutter out at mere distractions.*

While shaping spells, the Infernal doesn’t lose sorcerous motes for going a turn without gathering them. At glowing anima or higher, she gains one sorcerous mote at the end of each round if she didn’t gather any sorcerous motes during it, or two sorcerous motes at bonfire anima.
