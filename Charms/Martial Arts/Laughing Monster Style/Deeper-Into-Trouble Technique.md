The stylist jabs at sore spots and reopens old wounds, her tomfoolery driving enemies to distraction and rage. She doubles 10s on a decisive damage roll. If her enemy has a negative Tie towards her, she adds (Intimacy) damage dice. A damaged enemy becomes enraged — if he attacks her on or before his next turn and crashes or incapacitates her, he gains one Willpower. However, he suffers a −3 penalty on attacks against anyone else this scene until he hits her and can’t gain the Willpower bonus if he attacks another character first.
