*The Sidereal recites ritual prayers for health and prosperity, binding a spirit to the Maiden of Serenity’s service.*
The Sidereal spends at least an hour praying to a god or elemental with an Essence rating of up to (higher of Sidereal’s Essence or 3) to make a special (Intelligence + Linguistics) instill roll against him. Alternatively, the Sidereal can use this Charm against a spirit of any kind within short range, reciting the binding in a single turn.
Success summons that spirit, if applicable, and imposes a Defining Principle of “I must ensure and defend the joy, health, and pleasure of those around me” on him.
The Principle is only Major for spirits with Essence 4+. This Intimacy can’t be weakened or altered by any means. If it would let the spirit treat influence as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220), he must do so unless he has an Intimacy of equal or greater intensity that supports the influence.
This binding lasts (1 + Sidereal’s extra successes) months.
Once it ends, the Sidereal may have the spirit forget her identity and all memories of her. If he subsequently encounters evidence of her involvement in his binding, he may pay three Willpower to regain these memories.
Fire elementals and other fire spirits treat their Essence as one lower for purposes of this Charm.
## Reset
Once per day for spirits with Essence 1-3, or once per session for spirits with Essence 4+.
