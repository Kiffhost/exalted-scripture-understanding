*The Abyssal arcs through the air with the fatal force of a reaping scythe to cull the ranks of the living.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she jumps into close range with an enemy and makes a non-ranged attack against him on the same turn. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice of post-soak withering damage or decisive damage.
If the Abyssal uses Earth-Forsaking Attitude to avoid falling damage after this attack, she reduces its total cost by two motes.
