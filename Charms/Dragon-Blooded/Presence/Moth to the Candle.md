*Outraged foes rush headlong for the Dragon-Blood like !!mothsplungingtotheirdoom.TheDragon-Blood’senemies!! are so enraged by the sight of her that they must prioritize attacking her over any other character.*
This doesn’t prevent them from taking non-attack actions, but they cannot attack her allies as long as she remains in the fight. An enemy can resist this for one scene by spending a point of [[Willpower]]. This Charm also reduces the cost of [[Unbearable Taunt Technique]] to one mote. If the Dragon-Blood successfully taunts an enemy who hasn’t resisted Moth to the Flame, that character must use his next turn to move into range and attack her if possible.
