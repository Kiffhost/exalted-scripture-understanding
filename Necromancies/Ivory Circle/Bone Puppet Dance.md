*With a dire syllable of command, the necromancer’s brand blooms on her victim’s ribcage, calling his skeleton to free itself from his flesh.*
The necromancer rolls (Intelligence + Occult) against a target at up to medium range, opposed by a (Stamina + Resistance) roll. If successful, she takes control of his bones for (1 + threshold successes) rounds. At the start of each of the victim’s turns he rolls (Stamina + Resistance) against a difficulty of the necromancer’s (Intelligence). On failure, the necromancer may select one of the following effects
- The victim suffers three dice of unsoakable withering damage as his skeleton twists and dances within his flesh. The necromancer doesn’t gain Initiative from this. Crashed enemies suffer dice of lethal damage instead, ignoring Hardness.
- The victim falls prone, staggers one range band in any direction, drops a weapon or object, or takes a similar action as a result of the necromancer’s control. This doesn’t count against his actions for the round.
- The necromancer makes a decisive attack as the skeleton attempts to tear the victim apart.
It automatically hits, adding one die of damage for each remaining round of the spell’s duration.
This automatically ends the spell.
Alternatively, this spell can animate a corpse as a bonesider (Exalted, p. 506) with a Defining Tie of obedience to the necromancer that cannot be altered. This Intimacy doesn’t spread to other bonesiders created by the necromancer’s servitor.
## Control
Skeletons that kill their host tear themselves free of the victim to become bonesiders, as above.
Whenever the necromancer experiences intense emotion, such as anger or sadness, her own skeleton twists in odd ways, contorting her like a gruesome marionette.
## Distortion (8)
Distorting Bone Puppet Dance lets a contesting necromancer take control of the victim’s skeleton.
