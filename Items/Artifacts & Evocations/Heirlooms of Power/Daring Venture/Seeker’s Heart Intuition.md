*Imbued with the spirit of exploration, [[Daring Venture]] probes the wilderness for unfamiliar places of interest and guides its wielder in their direction.*
If the wielder seeks an unknown location she can name, such as a town or natural feature, [[Daring Venture]] provides the wielder with its direction relative to her position. Alternatively, if the wielder seeks novelty from the unknown, [[Daring Venture]] points her toward undiscovered or forgotten places of significance or power, such as demesnes or historical ruins. [[Daring Venture]] never points the wielder toward locations sheâ€™s previously visited. 

## Resonant

Once per week, a wielder who resonates with jade gains one [[Willpower]] when she activates this Evocation, which she can only spend on any applicable [[Ride]], [[Sail]], or [[Survival]] charm to move in the direction indicated.
