*Lies and dissimulation intoxicate enemies with their own aggression, setting them against each other as the stylist exults in discord.*
If the stylist successfully dodges an attack, she redirects it against another character within range of the original attack. The attack and all effects enhancing it are rerolled, using the same dice pool, against the new target. Any [[Initiative]] a withering attack would grant the attacker goes to the stylist instead. If the stylist has any damage bonuses against her attacker from [[Furiously Stalling Destiny]], they also apply to the redirected attack (and her next attack against him).
If the redirected attack roll exceeds its target’s [[Resolve]], he forms a Minor Tie of outrage towards the attacker or strengthens an existing negative Tie one step. Any positive Ties he has towards that character are suppressed for the scene. The stylist may reflexively roll ([[Manipulation]] + [Presence or Socialize]) to persuade the victim to act against the attacker’s interests in some fashion. This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if both attacker and victim are affected by [[Thieves Fall Out]] and within close range of each other. 
## Mastery
The stylist can use Supplemental Laughing Monster [[Charms]] to enhance redirected attacks. 
## Terrestrial
The stylist can only redirect attacks to crashed or trivial enemies.
