The Wood Dragon lives so that all may live. To use this Charm, the Immaculate must have Initiative 12+. She lays hands on another character, activating pressure points with gentle touches as verdant Essence flows from her hands to suffuse his body and heal his wounds. She rolls (Initiative), healing her ally one level of non-aggravated damage for each success, to a maximum of (his Stamina + Resistance) levels. She suffers an unpreventable level of bashing damage for every two health levels she heals this way, rounded down. Using this Charm resets the Immaculate to base Initiative. If she expends her Wood Aura, she only loses Initiative equal to the total levels of damage healed, to a minimum of her base Initiative. A character can only benefit from this Charm once per day.
