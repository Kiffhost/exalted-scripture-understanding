*With this Charm, the Solar’s player may retroactively describe the process by which the Lawgiver created a perfect simulacrum of herself through an elaborate sorcerous project.*
This description occurs the moment the Solar’s incapacitated health level is checked off; instead of dying, the slain character is revealed to be a perfect double of the Solar. The real Solar may then be located anywhere the player chooses, so long as the Storyteller deems it plausible.
