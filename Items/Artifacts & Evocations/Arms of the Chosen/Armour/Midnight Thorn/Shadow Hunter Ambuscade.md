*Razor blooms fly from the armor like arrows as the wearer strikes from stealth, harrying her foes and catching them off guard.*
This Evocation can enhance an unexpected attack made with any Ability, stripping away ([[Essence]]) points of [[Initiative]] from the target and granting it to the wearer on a hit. Alternatively, she may transfer these points of [[Initiative]] to an ally within short range, creating an opening for him to take advantage of. 

## Resonant

This Evocation also adds one bonus success on the damage roll of an unexpected attack.
