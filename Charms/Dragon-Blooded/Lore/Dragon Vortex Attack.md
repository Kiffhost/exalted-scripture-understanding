At the apex of the Dragon-Blood’s understanding, she draws forth the power of her draconic ancestors, shaking Creation to its foundations as she unleashes the primal wrath of the elements. To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 15+. A tremendous burst of elemental [[Essence]] radiates outward from her, a onetime environmental hazard that extends to close range, plus an additional range band for every ten [[Initiative]] she has. The aspect of this Charm and the hazard’s nature depend on which Elemental Aura she expends. [[Allies]] and enemies alike are caught in the hazard, but it won’t harm the Dragon-Blood’s Sworn Kin. If she knows [[Enfolded in the Dragon’s Wings]] (p. 282), she may likewise spare allied characters. The hazard has difficulty (the Dragon-Blood’s [[Intelligence]]), but doesn’t have a standard damage. Instead, the Dragon-Blood divides her [[Initiative]] evenly, rounding up, among all characters who failed their rolls to determine how much lethal damage is rolled against each. Battle groups and trivial opponents instead suffer (her full [[Initiative]]) damage, without counting against the total she divides. As long as at least one enemy fails his roll, this resets the Dragon-Blood to base [[Initiative]]. The hazard carries additional effects based on its aspect: 
## Air

Roiling storm clouds darken the sky, unleashing countless bolts of lightning and raining down hail. Any character wearing metal armor, including armor made from the magical materials, applies its mobility penalty on his roll to resist the hazard. The damage roll benefits from double 9s. 

## Earth

The earth rumbles in a mighty earthquake, scattering stone debris skyward to strike flying foes. A character that takes 3+ levels of damage falls into a chasm and lands prone, suffering damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232). Climbing out of the chasm counts as moving through difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199). 

## Fire

A pyroclasm sweeps across the battlefield, igniting anything flammable. As long as there’s fuel, even after the vortex fades, it leaves behind a hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round within its range, which burns for at least ([[Intelligence]]) hours. These flames won’t burn the Dragon-Blood or any allies spared from the vortex. 

## Water

A standing wave towers above the Dragon-Blood before collapsing outward in all directions with tsunami force. For every three levels of damage a character suffers from the hazard, rounded up, he’s knocked back one range band from the Dragon-Blood to fall prone, and suffers an additional three dice of bashing damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. 

## Wood

Fast-growing briar patches and massive thorny vines spread rapidly across the battlefield, while bright-colored flowers bloom with poisonous pollen. Characters who fail their roll must roll ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) against a poison with Damage 3i/round, Duration ([[Essence]] + [[Intelligence]]) rounds, and a −3 penalty. Additionally, the area of the hazard becomes difficult terrain until the plant growth has been cleared entirely. The Dragon-Blood and any allies spared from the vortex are unimpeded by this terrain, the plants parting to clear their path. If any of the Dragon-Blood’s Sworn Kin are within the vortex’s initial range and in Elemental Aura, they may expend it to add that element’s effect to the hazard. The expended Aura must be of an element that hasn’t already been expended; each participating Dragon-Blood must contribute a unique element to the vortex. Crashed Hearthmates can’t contribute their Aura. Each Hearthmate who expends his Aura adds +1 to the hazard’s Difficulty and adds his [[Initiative]] to the primary Dragon-Blood’s total to determine both the range and damage of the hazard, resetting him to base [[Initiative]]. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).
