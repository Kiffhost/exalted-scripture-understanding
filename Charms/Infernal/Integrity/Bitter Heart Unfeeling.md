*The Infernal’s calloused heart grows ever stronger from hate, and ever more inhospitable to lesser passions.*

The Infernal gains +2 Resolve against influence that’s opposed by a negative Intimacy. The bonus is non-Charm if it’s a Tie of hatred or a Principle related to revenge. Her Resolve can’t be penalized by positive Ties toward individuals, and any such Intimacies that would have penalized her Resolve are weakened by one step.

The Infernal can’t use Ties to her Lunar mate with this Charm — hate him as she may, their bond is undeniable. Likewise, this Charm can’t negate Resolve penalties from positive Ties to her mate.
With Integrity 5, Essence 3, the Infernal’s Resolve can’t be penalized by any positive Intimacies of any kind, not just Ties to individuals.
