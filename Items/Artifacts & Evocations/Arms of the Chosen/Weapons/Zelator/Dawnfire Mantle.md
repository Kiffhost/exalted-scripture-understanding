The effects of [[Corona of Radiance]] (Exalted, p. 352) apply to Zelator’s baneful attacks even against non– creatures of darkness. In addition, while the Exalt is benefiting from any of the following [[Charms]], their effects also extend to her steed: [[Corona of Radiance]], [[Element-Resisting Prana]] (Exalted, p. 412), and [[Nine Specters Ban]] (Exalted, p. 357).
