*Darkness is an eager accomplice to the Abyssal’s wickedness, bearing her unseen through the night..*
The Abyssal can use this Charm while in concealment, vanishing and reappearing somewhere within close range without needing to make new [[Stealth]] roll. She doesn’t cross the space between, but her movement can’t go through solid obstructions. This uses the Abyssal’s movement action.
The new location must still provide an adequate hiding spot for concealment. This can’t be waived by magic like [[Unseen Wisp Method]].
With [[Essence]] 4, the Abyssal’s movement can pass through obstructions that are transparent or only partially opaque, like a window or portcullis.
With [[Essence]] 5, the Abyssal can pay a five-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s range in dark conditions. As long as there’s any visibility penalty, it increases to short range, or to medium range in total darkness.
