One day, there’ll be a maiden...
Who’ll slip free of Time’s clutches
and stand outside eternity.
But try as she might,
she won’t be able to escape her memories
or her hopes for the future.
Perceiving the nature of her prison,
She’ll see how many times she’s escaped
and how many times she failed.
“Do you understand now?” asked Time,
“There is no end and no beginning.”
