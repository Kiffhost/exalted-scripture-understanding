*The Lunar’s voice draws all eyes to her, exerting an overwhelming gravity.*
She makes a special ({Appearance or Charisma} + {Performance or Presence}) inspire roll against all characters who hear her. As long as she continues to speak or sing, taking no nonreflexive actions, affected characters are compelled to approach as close as possible to her. This fascination can be exploited as though it were a Defining [[Intimacy]]. Characters will face risks equivalent to a serious task (Exalted, p. 216) to pursue her, but won’t take actions that would obviously physically harm them; if no safe path exists, they’ll stop and remain where they are. In combat, they must use their move action each turn to follow the Lunar, though they can still take other actions. This influence doesn’t prevent them from trying to harm her. This Charm is only usable once per scene. 
With a [[Charisma]] 5, [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, affected characters can’t attack or try to harm the Lunar or her allies. Characters who attack any pursuer lose this protection against all. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a prey animal with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] may learn this as an [[Appearance]] Charm, with Attention-Demanding [[Presence]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
