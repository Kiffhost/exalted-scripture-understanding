*The Lunar can spot a single bent blade of grass in a rolling pasture or a lone dinar missing from a vault.*
She rolls ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Survival}) to case a scene instantly, rerolling all dice that initially show failures. If successful, the Lunar banks non-Charm successes equal to the 10s on the roll. She can add up to ([[Essence]]) banked successes on [[Perception]] rolls she makes to follow up on the discovered clue, such as reading the intentions of a culprit the evidence implicates. Banked successes last until the story ends or the Lunar uses this Charm again. This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] by pursuing the information revealed by a case scene roll.
