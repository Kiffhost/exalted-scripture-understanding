The Solar strikes the roiling ground of an eruption point with Volcano Cutter’s tip, provoking a controlled geyser of [[Essence]] that wreathes the blade and propels her through the air toward her enemies. This Evocation may be used as soon as the Solar steps into an eruption point, preventing it from detonating beneath her, and instead flying up to two range bands away to make a decisive attack at a target of her choice upon landing (if there are any targets at that point)—if successful, this attack knocks the target prone. The Solar touches [[Volcano Cutter]] to the ground upon landing, discharging the corona of steam and boiling [[Essence]] back into the earth—effectively moving the eruption point to a new location. The point takes a moment to re-stabilize, and won’t detonate in response to someone standing on it until after the Solar’s next turn. If the Solar uses this Evocation on an eruption point with 15+ [[Initiative]], then she resets the old eruption point to [[Initiative]] 3 and leaves it behind, creating a new eruption point with 3 [[Initiative]] where she lands.
