Gathering her anima into a screaming, burning loop of surging enmity and power, the Solar hurls it at her foe in a blazing decisive attack. This attack requires no aim action, gains a number of automatic successes equal to her current anima levels greater than dim, and cannot be used at the dim level. Extra successes on this attack are added to the Solar’s Initiative to determine raw damage. In addition, if is used against demons, ghosts, or other creatures of the night, it does a number of automatic successes on the damage roll equal to the Solar’s Essence. Fiery Solar Chakram can only be used once per fight unless reset. After discharging it, the Solar’s hands glow and burn painfully, gloved in intensely-colored anima as it flees her body. Using this Charm sets her anima back to the dim level, and in order to use it again, the player must make three separate stunts in which her anima grows while she begins to produce the strength to unleash another fiery chakram.
