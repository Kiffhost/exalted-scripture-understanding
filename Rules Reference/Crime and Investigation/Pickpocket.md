Stealing an item from another character’s person is a (Dexterity + Larceny) roll opposed by the target’s (Perception + Awareness). If the thief’s roll succeeds, he is able to retrieve the item without his victim noticing. If it fails, not only does he not steal the item, but his victim realizes that he was trying to steal from her. It is impossible to pickpocket items that are in active use by a character without magic, nor is it generally possible to steal clothing, armor, or any other item too bulky to feasibly remove without its wearer noticing. These rules can also be used to steal unattended items from a store without the shopkeeper noticing, or to perform simple feats of prestidigitation that seem like magic to those who fail their rolls.
