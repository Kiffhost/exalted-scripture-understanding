This Charm supplements a read intentions action (p. 218), applying the double 9s rule to the Solar’s roll. In addition, the Exalt may substitute Wits for Perception when she is reading the intentions of a person with whom she is speaking. A Socialize 4+ repurchase enhances this Charm’s performance. When the Solar discerns the intentions of her target, the player may speculate on the existence of one of the target’s related Intimacies. If the player is correct, the Solar becomes aware of that Intimacy as per Cunning Insight Technique. A Socialize 5 repurchase enhances this Charm when it is used to speculate about a target’s Intimacy; if the player’s first speculation is incorrect, the player may inquire about the existence of a second Intimacy.
