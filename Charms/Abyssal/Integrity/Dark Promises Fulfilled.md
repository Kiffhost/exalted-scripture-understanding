*Drawing the oaths that bind her tight around her soul, the Abyssal summons up power to work her dark miracles.*
Brooding over her obligations, the Abyssal chooses one of the agreements she’s sworn to with [[Bound by the Old Laws]] and still has a Principle for. She rolls ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Integrity]]), adding ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice, and gains motes equal to her successes. She can only spend these motes on magic used to uphold her end of the deal, and she can’t spend them in combat. If she’s a necromancer or sorcerer, the banked motes can also be spent on spells.
These motes are lost if not spent by the end of the day. If the Abyssal completes her part of the agreement before then, she retains up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) of them, or all of them if she fulfilled a serious or life-changing task to hold up her end (Exalted, p. 216).
