*The Infernal’s steed seems to charge a foe, seems to grow huge beyond his imagining, huge beyond the cosmos — and then space snaps back, bringing the Infernal’s foe with it.*

The Infernal makes a special mounted rush against an enemy within short range, adding Strength dice. If she succeeds, that character is dragged one range band toward her by the force of her spiritual pressure, instead of a rush action’s usual effect.

If the Infernal rolls 3+ extra successes, her enemy falls prone. If he is smaller than either the Infernal or her mount, she doesn’t need any extra successes to knock him prone.
