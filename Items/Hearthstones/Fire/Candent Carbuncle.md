This irregularly rounded stone looks like a glowing coal, and is always warm to the touch. When socketed into armor or a decorative artifact such as a hearthstone amulet or bracer, the Candent Carbuncle grants the opportunity to awaken the following Evocations:
Burning Coal Fist
Cost: 3m; Mins: Essence 1
Type: Supplemental
Keywords: Dual
Duration: Instant
Prerequisite Charms: None
The Exalt may draw the illimitable heat of Creation into her body, momentarily wreathing an attacking fist or leg in flame. This Evocation supplements an unarmed attack, granting (lower of Essence or 3) additional raw damage to withering attacks, and permitting decisive attacks to re-roll up to (lower of Essence or 3) 10s.
Incandescent Lance
Cost: 7m, 3i, 1wp; Mins: Essence 2
Type: Simple
Keywords: Dual
Duration: Instant
Prerequisite Charms: Burning Coal Fist
Drawing on the geomantic power seething in the hearthstone, the Exalt sets her Essence ablaze and hurls it at a foe. This may take the form of a searing fireball or a roaring plume of flame, as desired. The character makes a (Dexterity + [Brawl or Martial Arts])-based unarmed attack at a target out to short range, with the benefits of Burning Coal Fist attached.
