*When her soul is glimpsed, the Solar may twist the very perceptions of her subject.*
The Solar may invoke this Charm when a character pierces her [[Guile]], supplying a false purpose for her true motives. If the initiate inquires as to one of her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], and manages to uncover one, she may also use this Charm to misdirect his interpretation, changing the context of a [[Intimacy|Tie]] or the wording of a [[Intimacy|Principle]] to mislead him. This causes the initiate to make incorrect assumptions about the Solar’s loyalties, interests or objectives, causing his social influence against her to be less effective or completely implausible. For example, he might discern that she is a devotee of the Immaculate Faith when in reality she holds the [[Order]] in contempt. His persuasion to get her to aid the [[Order]] by informing on her fellow Solars would then experience a boost in her [[Resolve]], rather than a weakening. Though this Charm is paid instantly, the Solar’s false [[Intimacy]] lingers until the end of the story. She is not compelled by this [[Intimacy]] and may freely act against it, nor is her [[Resolve]] lowered through its exploitation. However, should she experience [[Limit Break]] before the end of the story, the [[Intimacy]] becomes real, capable of influencing her until the story ends.
