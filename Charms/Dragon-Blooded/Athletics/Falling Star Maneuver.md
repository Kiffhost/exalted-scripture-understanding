*The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s speed builds into an all-sundering force, burning red around her as she crosses the battlefield.*
She may use this Charm when she successfully rushes an enemy with [[Dancing Ember Stride]], or when she descends from the air into close range with an enemy, to make a reflexive decisive attack at close range with [[Brawl]], [[Martial Arts]], or [[Melee]]. This counts as her combat action for the turn. A successful attack creates a shockwave as a one-time environmental hazard stretching out to short range from her foe. Its difficulty is ([[Strength]]), and its Damage is equal to the total levels of damage she rolled on her attack, to a maximum of ([[Essence]])L. The Dragon-Blood is immune to this hazard, but other characters, including her allies, are subject to it. A character that takes damage falls prone and is knocked one range band away from the Exalt.
