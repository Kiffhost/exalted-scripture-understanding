*By tapping her own spirit, the Solar can imbue her mount with endless energy.*
The mount can run at full speed for an hour without becoming fatigued, and gains an automatic success toward all movement and balance-related actions. Furthermore, while this Charm is active the Exalt may use the [[Athletics]] [[Charms]] [[Graceful Crane Stance]] and [[Monkey Leap Technique]] (p. 261) while mounted, allowing her mount to keep its footing on the worst terrain and to leap across gaps or over obstacles.
