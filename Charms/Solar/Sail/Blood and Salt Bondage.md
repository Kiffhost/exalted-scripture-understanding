Drawing on ancient wards and pacts between the Essence of sea and sky, the Solar awakens the anima of her ship. Over the course of the next month, the Solar and her crew experience an increase in vitality, as the ship’s Essence feeds and strengthens their flesh. Each member of the crew, including the Exalt, gains a number of health levels identical to the ship’s hull rating. These health levels remain in place even if the Solar or her crewmates disembark; only characters who are off the ship for a month or more lose this benefit, bonus health levels fading as their bond with the ship diminishes. If the ship should suffer hull damage while this Charm is active, the bonus levels are summarily stricken from the Solar and her crew. Such indirect damage does not generate wound penalties, however—simply discard bonus health levels until the ship’s hull is repaired.
