Infuriated by an attacker’s temerity, the Lawgiver’s mount strikes an attack aside with one of its own. When the Exalt’s steed is using Worthy Mount Technique, and has been rolled into battle using Seasoned Beast-Rider’s Approach, the mount may unleash a decisive clash attack against any attack directed at the Solar. If the mount is clashing a withering attack while its rider is at base or lower Initiative, ignore the Willpower cost of this Charm.
