*False documents and strange ciphers wither on the page under the deathknight’s scrutiny, for even deception may die.*
The Abyssal rolls ({[[Perception]] or [[Intelligence]]} + [[Linguistics]]) to identify forgeries, break encryption, or see through similar ways of obscuring a text’s meaning. She doubles 9s and adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm successes. She succeeds automatically against mundane encryption and forgeries. Success lets her decipher the text as she reads it, completing hours or days of work in minutes.
