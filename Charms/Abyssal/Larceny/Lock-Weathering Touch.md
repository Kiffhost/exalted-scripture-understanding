*The Abyssal shatters whatever bars her way.*
For five motes, the Abyssal destroys a mundane lock, manacle, or similar restraint with a touch, rusting it to nothingness.
Against magically-enhanced locks, the Abyssal can pay one mote to double 9s and add ([[Essence]]) successes, assuming she has appropriate tools. She bypasses the lock even on a failed roll â€” instead, failure indicates an unfortunate development, such as a guard coming to investigate, her lockpicks breaking, a trap being triggered, or similar.
