The Sidereal is convinced that any problem, danger, or complication she faces is caused by some greater peril, chosen by her player when she succumbs to this Hubris. She’s unwilling to entertain any alternative theories, no matter how far-fetched blaming things on the chosen enemy or peril is. She need not overlook someone’s obvious culpability for their own actions; she’ll simply see him as acting on her ultimate enemy’s behalf.
This ends if the Sidereal or someone for whom she has a positive Major or Defining Tie comes to harm from a peril that the Sidereal had dismissed as a threat.
