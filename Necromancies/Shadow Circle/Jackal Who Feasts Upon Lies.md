*Speaking the first half of a truth abhorrent to the Gaoler of Uqad, the necromancer lures and binds one of that tyrant’s enormous jackals, trained in the Gaoler’s sanddrenched holdfast to feast on the meat of deceivers.*
The necromancer conjures one of the Jackals Who Feast Upon Lies. It has a Defining Tie of loyalty to the necromancer which can’t be broken or degraded. It serves faithfully for seven days, after which it returns to the Gaoler with news of the world and its secrets.
## Control
The necromancer’s laugh is loud, hollow, and unsettling, especially when she laughs at others’ misfortune. When she successfully piercing a deception, like seeing through a disguise or unraveling a lie, she may make a reflexive inspire roll against the deceiver to create feelings of fear or despair, adding (Occult). Success also inflicts a −1 penalty on all rolls the target makes for the rest of the scene, even if he resists the influence with Willpower.
## Distortion (15)
The jackal’s tie to the necromancer becomes Minor, and it loses the Scent of Falsehood Merit. While it still won’t attack its summoner, it can be distracted or convinced to attack one of her allies who’s demonstrated falsehood recently.
