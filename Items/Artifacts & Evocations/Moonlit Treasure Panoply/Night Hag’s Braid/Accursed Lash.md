A feverish delirium afflicts those scourged by the Night Hag’s Braid.
The wielder rerolls up to (Essence) 6s on a withering or decisive damage roll. If she deals 3+ decisive damage or crashes her target with a withering attack, she curses him for the rest of the scene.
When a cursed enemy makes an (Attribute + Ability) roll, up to (Essence) 6s subtract successes. 6s also count as 1s for determining if the roll botches (Exalted, p. 186).
The cursed enemy also suffers −1 Resolve and Guile.
This Psyche effect can’t be resisted with Willpower.
## Resonant
The wielder adds an automatic success on the attack roll.
