The Exalt descends upon her victim with the intent to inflict terrible pain as smoke and coiling flames roll from the Smiling Razors’ blades. To use this Evocation, she must be in concealment. She makes a decisive attack against an opponent who cannot perceive her. If her attack deals enough damage to increase his wound penalty, he doubles his wound penalty for the rest of the scene, to a maximum of (4 + wielder’s Essence). 

## Resonant

If the wielder resonates with jade, the victim’s wound penalties remain doubled until he’s healed at least one level of lethal damage.
