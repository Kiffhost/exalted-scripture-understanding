Once, there was a maiden…
...and before her came all the peoples of Creation,
and knelt.
They set aside their petty squabbles in her name.
They acclaimed her with many shouts.
They prayed for her safety, and her weal.
Not one of them struck free her chains.
“To know the world...”
“...is to own it,” she said.
