## [[Limit Break]]

Once a character has accumulated 10 [[Limit]] points, he will enter a state called [[Limit Break]].

# Solar

Limit is a measure of stress, self-doubt, and mental instability. As a Solar accrues [[Limit]], the power of the Great Curse gains a stronger purchase on his soul. While this growing corruption may be invisible to others, the cursed Exalt finds his thoughts wandering in darker directions.

When he reaches 10 Limit, the Curse spills over and can no longer be contained, erupting into Limit Break. 

The Solar Exalted gain Limit in the following ways: 
- Once per scene, when a character acts in a way that opposes one of his Major Intimacies, his player rolls a single die, gaining one point of Limit for each success (unless he’s already rolled for acting against a Defining Intimacy; see below). Note that weakening an Intimacy always counts as opposing it, as does spending Willpower to resist an influence roll supported by that Intimacy.
- Once per scene, when a character acts against one of his Defining Intimacies, his player rolls two dice for Limit (or one die if he’s already rolled for acting against a Major Intimacy). This otherwise functions as acting against a Major Intimacy, above.
- All Solars have a Limit Trigger selected at character creation, a special condition under which a character can gain Limit. When a character’s Limit Trigger is met, his player rolls three dice for Limit, gaining one point per success. Legendary Social Goals When a Solar character successfully completes a major, landmark goal or accomplishment such as reclaiming their homeland from the Realm or winning the love of their ancient Lunar mate, they may lose a point of Limit at the Storyteller’s discretion.
## Legendary Social Goals 

When a Solar character successfully completes a major, landmark goal or accomplishment such as reclaiming their homeland from the Realm or winning the love of their ancient Lunar mate, they may lose a point of Limit at the Storyteller’s discretion.

# Lunars

When Lunars face great stress and strain, the Great Curse whispers to all that is monstrous in them, setting it free. Its influence is measured by Limit. As a Lunar’s Limit rises, dark passions haunt her heart; she grows keenly aware of how easily she could embrace monstrosity. 

This is solely a matter of roleplaying until she reaches Limit 10. Once a Lunar gains 10 Limit, she enters Limit Break. 

Lunars gain Limit in the following ways: 
- Once per scene, when a Lunar acts against a Major Intimacy, she rolls one die, gaining Limit equal to the successes (unless she’s already rolled for acting against a Defining Intimacy). Voluntarily weakening an Intimacy or spending Willpower to resist influence it supports counts as acting against it. 
- Once per scene, when a Lunar acts against a Defining Intimacy, she rolls two dice, gaining Limit equal to the successes (or one die, if she’s already rolled for acting against a Major Intimacy). 
- Each Lunar has a Limit trigger, a specific condition under which she gains Limit. When it’s met, she rolls three dice, gaining Limit equal to the successes. 

A Lunar loses one Limit when she accomplishes a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134). Her Limit resets at a Limit Break’s end.
# Sidereals

Sidereals gain Limit under the following circumstances: 
- Once per scene, when a Sidereal acts against a Defining Intimacy, she rolls two dice, gaining Limit equal to the successes. 
- When the Sidereal’s advice goes ignored or a plan she suggests is shot down, she rolls one die, or (Intimacy) dice if she has an Intimacy that supports the plan, and gains Limit equal to her successes. She can’t roll more than four dice total per scene this way. 
- Each Sidereal has a unique Limit trigger that exacerbates her Great Curse. When it’s met, she rolls three dice, gaining Limit equal to her successes. 

Gaining Limit reaffirms a Sidereal’s confidence — gaining Limit grants her one Willpower, maximum once per scene.

A Sidereal can lose Limit by fulfilling Auspicious Prospects. When she faces a major defeat or setback, her player may choose to lose one Limit and one Willpower. Sidereals don’t lose Limit from accomplishing legendary social goals; such triumphs do little to mitigate their hubris.
