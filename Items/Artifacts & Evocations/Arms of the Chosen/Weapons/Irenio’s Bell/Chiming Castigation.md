The wielder channels the shield’s harmonics into her opponent’s weapon, which shakes wildly in his hand. Upon successfully blocking an attack using [[Irenio’s Bell]], the Exalt can activate this Evocation to impose a two-die penalty on the opponent’s attack rolls. The penalty lasts until the end of the opponent’s next turn for unarmed attacks, but a weapon continues to vibrate until end of scene. This vibration can be damped by successfully striking a target. 

## Resonant

A character resonant with orichalcum may repurchase this Evocation at [[Essence]] 3, allowing her to spend an additional 1v to shatter a non-artifact weapon that she successfully blocks.
