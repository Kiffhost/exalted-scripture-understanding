*The Infernal’s ego is swollen with baleful power, guiding her in self-serving pursuit of her own ends.*

The Infernal’s empowered ego has the following effects:
- She can instinctually determine how much a given course of action would benefit her, as long as this could potentially be found with some kind of roll with difficulty 1-5 based on information available to her.
- When she takes an action that directly benefits herself at the expense of others, she adds (Essence) dice. This doesn’t apply on attack rolls or other hostile actions in combat.
- Once per scene, when she succeeds on an action that received this Charm’s bonus, she may gain motes equal to her 9s and 10s on the roll, maximum (Manipulation).
- However, if she willingly takes an action that benefits others more than herself, she loses three motes if she succeeds. If it helps others in a significant way while providing no benefit to the Infernal, she loses ten motes instead.

The Infernal can’t end this Charm voluntarily. If she renews it at the end of its duration, she waives its Willpower cost.
