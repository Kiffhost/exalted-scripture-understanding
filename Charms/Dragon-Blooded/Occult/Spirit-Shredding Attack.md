Rending a spiritâ€™s ephemeral form, the Dragon-Blood disperses its Essence like dust on the wind. Her decisive attack with any combat Ability against a crashed spirit adds attack roll threshold successes as dice of damage. A spirit slain by this attack can potentially reform its Essence (Exalted, pp. 508-509), but does so greatly diminished, losing a permanent dot of Essence. This reduces its mote pool by ten motes, and may deny it access to certain Charms based on their Essence minimums.
