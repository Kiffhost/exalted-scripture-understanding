*The Infernal dissolves into a crimson wind to blow through walls. Sometimes she leaves, finding freedom; sometimes she enters, finding victims.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must spend two consecutive turns advancing toward an obstacle she wishes to pass through. As long as there’s any opening whatsoever, she can pass through to the other side. She can’t pass through obstacles that are more than one range band thick. This uses her movement action.
## [[Keys]]
#### Wind-Scoured Prison Liberation (Essence 4)
The Infernal no longer needs to advance toward an obstacle before using this Charm and can use it reflexively on her turn in combat. She can pass through thicker barriers by using it on multiple consecutive turns. She waives the health level cost of uses past the first. While moving through such obstructions, the Infernal has full cover (Exalted, p. 199), though appropriate magic or stunts might circumvent this. If she doesn’t renew this Charm at the start of her turn, she’s ejected from the barrier at the point she entered it.
