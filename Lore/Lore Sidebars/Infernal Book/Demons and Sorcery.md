Like mortals and the Chosen, only a few demons have the potential to master sorcery. Of those who do, all can learn Terrestrial Circle sorcery. The few First Circle demons who learn it may earn patronage for their useful talents and ambition, or else be squashed down for their vainglory. Second and Third Circle demons can learn Celestial Circle sorcery, though few consider themselves
dedicated sorcerers. There may be a few of the most powerful Third Circle demons capable of using Solar Circle sorcery with some limitations, though its full power is reserved for the Yozis themselves.
