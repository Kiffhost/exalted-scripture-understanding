The Dragon-Blood becomes one with the unseen flow of air that moves through Creation, unleashing a chop or kick that hones the wind into a swirling vortex. She makes a decisive attack against an enemy within medium range. She may choose to unleash the wind in a blast, remaining where she is, or to throw herself into the whirlwind as it flies towards her foe, instantly moving into close range with him. The latter counts as her movement for the turn. The damage of the attack equals (Dexterity + attack roll threshold successes)L, ignoring Hardness. It doesn’t include her Initiative, nor does it reset her to base. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy whose Initiative was higher than the Dragon-Blood’s with a single withering attack.
