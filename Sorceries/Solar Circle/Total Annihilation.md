*The sorcerer raises one finger to the sky in a heaven-piercing mudra. All light bends and dim around her hand, desperate to escape the Elder Sun whose lost name she now invokes.*

The sorcerer casts a orb of coruscating emerald energy at a point within medium range. No attack roll is required, but such power is reluctant to be commanded: the blaze doesn’t impact its destination until the start of her next turn, though its intended destination is clear to all observers.

On impact, the facsimile Green Sun erupts into a spear of all-consuming emerald light. This burning pillar extends out to close range from the point of impact and extends outward by another range band at the end of each round, maximum long range. It extends six range bands upwards. All characters who must succeed on a difficulty 5 (Wits + Resistance) roll or be permanently blinded. The difficulty is reduced by 1 for each range band past the first between a character and the point of impact, minimum 2.

The emerald light is an environmental hazard with difficulty 5. Unlike most hazards, it inflicts five levels of aggravated damage on a failed roll, or five dice of aggravated damage on a successful roll. Characters damaged by it are exposed to green sun wasting (p. XX), and are permanently blinded if they suffer 3+ levels of damage. Those killed by it become shadows smeared across the landscape, leaving not even dust behind. The hazard deals uncountable damage to trivial characters, Might 0 battle groups, and most mundane scenery. It always counts as a source of recurring uncountable damage for Charms capable of defending against them.

Once the hazard reaches long range, it releases a shockwave of burning ash and tainted air at the end of the next round. This is a lesser environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 5L that extends out to short range from the emerald light’s edges. At the end of each subsequent round, it expands outward by one range band, but its difficulty is reduced by 1 each time. Once it reaches long from the blaze’s edge, it disperses. With that, the emerald light finally curdles and collapses, leaving desolation in its wake.
# Control
The sorcerer’s anima and eyes throb with emerald light. She can hurl the orb out to long range and is immune to being blinded by both the initial flash and the hazard. Characters with Ties of fear toward Ligier also treat them as applying to the sorcerer while interacting with her.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
This spell can only be distorted in the time between the sorcerer casting it and the blaze impacting its destination. If successful, the distorting sorcerer redirects the orb to a new destination before it impacts. The destination must be within the spell’s range and within medium range of the original destination.
