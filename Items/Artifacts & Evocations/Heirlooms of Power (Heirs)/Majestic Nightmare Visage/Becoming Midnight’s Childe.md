Subsuming herself in the Childe of Midnights Unremembered’s mythos, the wearer becomes the mask.
She gains one of the Childe’s Intimacies, listed below, and suppresses one of her own Intimacies of equal or higher intensity. If the Childe’s Intimacy has been fully eroded, the suppressed Intimacy returns; until then, the wearer can’t voluntarily strengthen it or a substantially similar Intimacy.
If a Dragon-Blood uses Terrifying Forest-Devil Mask to disguise herself as the Childe, she may use this Evocation reflexively to take on all of the Childe’s Intimacies, as above, in place of the Defining Intimacy that Charm normally confers.
None of those Intimacies can be weakened or changed for that Charm’s duration. She must suppress the same number of her own Intimacies; if she lacks sufficient Intimacies of equal or higher rating, she can’t use this Evocation.
