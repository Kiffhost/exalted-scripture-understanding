*Empyrean Aegis flies from its wielder’s hands to shelter her allies.*
She can take a defend other action to protect an ally within short range. Each time her ward is attacked, she must pay one [[Initiative]] to extend her protection to him unless he’s within close range. If an attacker beats the wielder’s [[Defense|Parry]], he can only direct his attack against the original target, rather than her.
## Resonant
With [[Essence]] 2, the wielder can protect allies out to medium range.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens at no cost when a Dragon-Blooded Tepet scion attunes [[Empyrean Aegis]].
