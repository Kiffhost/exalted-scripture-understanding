*The Lunar defeats arguments by agreeing with them, playing off the sincerest of statements with jovial manner and deft wit.*
When a character makes an influence roll, she opposes it with a ([[Manipulation]] + {Performance, [[Presence]], or Socialize}) roll. If she rolls more successes, her reaction to that character’s influence convinces all other affected targets that it was meant sarcastically, ironically, or humorously, inverting its effect. An instill roll accusing the Lunar of various misdeeds would be seen as praise for her, building positive Ties; an inspire roll to calm a crowd only angers them further. This Charm won’t invert an influence roll’s effect against the Lunar unless she enhances it with [[Whispering Silver Serpent]], waiving the [[Willpower]] cost of such an activation.
