The Sidereal is as strong as her strongest comrade. When the Sidereal makes a Strength-based roll, she rolls twice: once with her own dice pool, and once with the highest dice pool among her allies in the scene. Any magic she uses donâ€™t benefit his roll, although he can use his own to enhance it.
