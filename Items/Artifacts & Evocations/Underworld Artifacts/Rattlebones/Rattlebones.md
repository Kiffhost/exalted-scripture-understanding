*“During my stay with Clan Ophris, my host enlisted me in appraising the panoply of the late Thousand-Curses Masara, an Exigent revolutionary of unknown origin.*
Masara conducted a campaign of gruesome assassination and sabotage against the Irshad dynasty of Y’danna during the Jasmine [[War]], which heralded the beginning of the Ageless Empire's decline.
Noteworthy among these treasures was a [[crossbow]] of gruesomely unconventional design, a [[crossbow]] of soulsteel, sinew, and animated fingerbones, which load it with bolts and draw back its windlass. While ingenious, I confess the effect was singularly unsettling.
I ascertained that this work bore hallmarks characteristic of a ghostly artificer of fearsome reputation. The reclusive wraith is said to create weapons of a deathly and eccentric nature for those who are able to meet their abstruse costs and who are able to venture to their trading posts in the valleys of the Summer Mountains. Lest I be accused of tempting my readers, I will pen no further details on the subject, save to say that I believe Masara or one of her compatriots traveled this road. Furthermore, I believe this was the weapon used to carry out her grisly murders.
Some months after leaving the Dreaming Sea behind, I received a letter from my host's husband inquiring after leads on who may be interested in artifacts of this sort. Apparently, it had been stolen by rogues unknown and used in the murder of its former owner. Clan Ophris intends to go to great pains to bring the killers to justice. Despite my ready assistance, this artifact remains lost to this day.” —Ledaal Kusam Valdris, One Thousand Shards of Jade

The wielder can commit an additional mote to set Rattlebones’ skeletal digits to work, removing the Slow tag. If she has magic capable of reflexively reloading Slow weapons, she doesn’t need to commit the additional mote.
