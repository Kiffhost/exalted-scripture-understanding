Many [[Linguistics]] [[Charms]] feature both written and spoken delivery methods. A [[Linguistics]] Charm using the written method must be read to be effective, while a spoken delivery need only be heard. In most cases, these types of deliveries use identical rules, typically a roll of ([Social Attribute] + [[Linguistics]]). However, because social influence written into a letter, a missive, a book etc. may sometimes require minutes, hours, or days before the target actually receives and reads the writing, the rolls are timed differently. With written social influence, roll (Attribute + [[Linguistics]]) the moment the character finishes the composition and record the successes. The character must use any enhancing magic she knows at the moment this roll is required, because once she has finished encoding her work with magic, she may not alter it again without magic specifically for this purpose. After any relevant Intimacies are applied to lower the target’s [[Resolve]], the total successes are then compared to the target’s [[Resolve]] to see if the Charm takes effect. Spoken social influence works exactly like any other kind: roll (Attribute + [[Linguistics]]) the moment the character speaks to her target.
