*The Abyssal passes without trace, a phantom traveling a land that has already forgotten her.*
The Abyssal doubles 9s and adds ([[Essence]]) dice on a roll to conceal her tracks.
With a [[Survival]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to convert the added dice to automatic successes and let up to ([[Essence]] x2) allies share her roll’s result. Opposed tracking rolls fail automatically unless enhanced by magic. An enemy who fails his roll loses one [[Willpower]].
