Speaking harshly against those who’d break sacred traditions, the Lunar deters their transgressions. When she perceives a member of a culture toward which she has a positive Major or Defining Tie attempt to violate one of the culture’s customs, she reflexively makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [Presence or Socialize]) persuade roll against him. If successful, he must enter a Decision Point — invoking an [[Intimacy]] whose intensity is greater than or equal to that of his own Tie to that culture — and spend one [[Willpower]] to proceed with that action. If he doesn’t, he must abandon the attempt, and can’t retry it that scene. This Charm can only be used once per scene. Once per story, when the Lunar uses this Charm to reinforce a custom of a society ruled by her Solar mate, she forces her target into a Decision Point without needing to roll. 
## Protean 

In the shape of a human who holds a position of authority within the culture, or an animal shape attributed special significance by it, the Lunar adds ([[Essence]]) successes on the roll. In animal shapes, she ignores the [[Resolve]] bonus for lacking a common language.
