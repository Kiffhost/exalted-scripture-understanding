*With revelatory ardor and revolutionary sound, the Solar’s performance sends a shock through her audience.*
This Charm’s timing differs through various mediums: oratory requires a speech of at least six minutes in length, whereas a piece of music need only be three minutes long and dance need only be two. Roll ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes against the group’s [[Resolve]]. If successful, the group is struck with an emotion conveyed by the performance, and each affected target reconsiders a decision he made in his past, connected to that emotion. The Storyteller chooses what each character is forced to reconsider, putting each affected character into a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] based on past influence. This Charm may only be used once per story.
