*The Infernal forms deep bonds with her favoured demonic companions, binding them to her as vessels of her power.*

The Infernal may claim First Circle demons as [[Familiar]]s. If she uses sorcery to summon and bind a First Circle demon, it counts as a familiar for purposes of other Infernal Charms.
