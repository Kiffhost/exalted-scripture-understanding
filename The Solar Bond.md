In the First Age, the Lunars forged soul-deep bonds between themselves and the Solars. Not all Lunars have Solar mates (and vice versa), but for those who do, the experience of meeting one is unmistakable — the Lunar instantly recognizes him as her bonded mate, and forms a Minor Tie toward him with an emotional context chosen by her player, if she doesn’t have one already. 

Lunars’ feelings for their Solar mates run the gamut of human emotions, both positive and negative, but they’re all passionately felt. If a Lunar’s Tie for her Solar mate is ever fully eroded, she forms a new Minor Tie toward him with a player-chosen context at the scene’s end. A player who wants to guarantee her Solar mate will be a prominent and positive figure in her Lunar’s life should take the Allies Merit (p. XX). Otherwise, his appearances and role are up to the Storyteller — they can be friends, rivals, enemies, lovers, and more. 

If a Lunar’s Solar mate dies, he still counts as her mate until she meets his next incarnation. In the Time of Tumult, some Lunars have discovered their mates reincarnated as Abyssals or Infernals. This doesn’t change the bond’s effects, though it often complicates the Lunar’s relationship with her reborn mate.
