Seizing the crucial moment, the swordsman lunges forward into an all-or-nothing attack, her blade blurring into a flash of crimson-flecked steel. Against an enemy with lower Initiative, Fatal Stroke Flash adds the difference to the raw damage of a decisive attack against him. The bonus damage cannot exceed the swordsman’s own Initiative. However, if the attack misses, then the stylist’s own Initiative falls to equal the enemy’s before he suffers the usual Initiative loss for missing a decisive attack. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood can only use this Charm after parrying an attack that caused the attacker’s Initiative to fall beneath her own. Upon doing so, she may use Fatal Stroke Flash against him on her next turn. 

## Mastery

The martial artist may also double up to (Essence) 9s on the attack roll.
