*The crane embodies not violence, but elegance. The martial artist takes on its peaceful demeanor as she enters the stance of the [[Crane Form]], presenting a defense that carries no hint of hostile intent, nor any sign of weakness.* 
While in [[Crane Form]], the martial artist adds +1 Parry, and if she is wearing clothing with long, flowing sleeves, her garment will never be torn or stained in combat. In addition, the [[Initiative]] cost for the martial artist to take a full defense action is reduced by one point. While taking a full defense action, the martial artist may respond to any attack against her with a withering or decisive counterattack. Likewise, taking a defend other action allows her to respond to any attack against her ward with a counterattack. 
## Special activation rules
Whenever the martial artist successfully defends against an attack that causes her attackerâ€™s current [[Initiative]] to fall below her own, she may reflexively activate [[Crane Form]]. If she took a full defense or defend other action on her last turn, this potentially allows her to make a counterattack, if the conditions above are met.
