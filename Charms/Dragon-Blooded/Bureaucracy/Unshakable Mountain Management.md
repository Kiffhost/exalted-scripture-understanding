By her very presence, the Dragon-Blood guards the harmonious stability of bureaucracy against the disharmony of corruption and disloyalty. She may invoke this Charm whenever she perceives another character’s social influence that would cause characters to betray or sabotage an organization that they belong to, or abuse a position of power they hold within an organization. All members of that organization within medium range targeted by the influence gain +1 Resolve against it. In Earth Aura, this bonus rises to (the Dragon-Blood’s Essence/2, rounded up).
