*Baptized in the Underworld’s dark waters, the Abyssal mariner is a dread terror of the waves.*
The Abyssal gains the following benefits:
 - She rerolls 6s on [[Sail]] rolls until 6s no longer appear.
 - She can reflexively assume the attitude of a master seafarer, making her skill obvious to all who interact with her. She can leverage this with social influence as though it were a Minor Tie.
 - She can intuit the exact distance and route to any location she’s previously visited, whether by land or sea.
 - She adds (Sail/2, rounded up) dice on bargain, persuade, or threaten rolls against supernatural beings associated with bodies of water — ocean spirits, the ghosts of the drowned, Fair Folk pirates, aquatic behemoths, etc.
