*In the Usurpation’s aftermath, the shaman-smith Saint of the Sands fled to the Wyld and built a palace-forge in its depths.*
He savaged the Fair Folk, feeding them to his furnace to quicken his weapons of vengeance. [[Weirdflame]] was the last of these masterpieces, crafted from the chaos-twisted ruins of his workshop itself. Since the Saint’s death, [[Weirdflame]] and the rest of his arsenal have been scattered acros Creation and the Wyld, wielded by the [[Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] and its enemies alike, but few have matched Weirdflame’s infamy. Its flames burn with the Wyld’s power, twisting and tainting that which they touch rather than consuming them. In the hands of Eight-Eye Weaver, [[Weirdflame]] razed satrapies and transformed warriors into faceless monsters. The witch-king Kurzimand used it as an instrument of fear, warping criminals into awful grotesques. [[Weirdflame]] is a gaudy weapon, with a spiral moonsilver barrel shot through with veins of garish, pulsating chaos and a mother-of-pearl grip. Its flames burn in a rainbow of colors, both those known in Creation and alien spectra of the Wyld. It currently lies where its last wielder, the Four Pine Sage, sealed it away…yet [[Weirdflame]] still burns, beckoning its next master.
