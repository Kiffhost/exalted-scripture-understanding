Appearance is a measure of a character’s striking looks and his ability to use them. Generally, this means a measure of how attractive the character is, but for certain characters (see the Hideous merit, p. 162), Appearance measures how intimidatingly unpleasant the character’s looks are. Appearance is used when a character wishes to influence others through looks, beauty, overwhelming presence, or first impressions rather than reasoned debate or emotional manipulation.
