A knife is a weapon with a chopping and stabbing blade about a foot long, which can have a single or double edge.
Most adults in the world of Exalted carry a knife, for utility as well as personal defense. Knives are used as tableware and to cut and pry, as well as for combat. Knives can also be used as thrown weapons.
