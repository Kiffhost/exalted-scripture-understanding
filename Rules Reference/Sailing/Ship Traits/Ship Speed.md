Many elements govern the speed of a ship—currents, deployed oars, wind in the sails. Rather than a simple rating, speed is listed as a set of conditions—ships in dead calm waters and with no oarsmen have Speed 0, and raise this rating for each applicable variable listed in the ship’s traits. Speed is added to rolls where getting from one place to another in a hurry is important, as well as to attempts to pursue another ship or to evade pursuit.

Example: A fast courier vessel, running before the wind along a known trade current would have Speed +5—+1 from the current, +1 due to its small, nimble design, and +3 due to its proportionately huge sail. If it were not sailing along with the current, it would only have Speed +4.
