The Lawgiver unbinds a lost vision of glory and rises to greater power. The next time the Exalt stands to benefit from Immanent Solar Glory, that Charm now counts 8s, 9s and 10s for the purposes of restoring essence. Also upon using this Charm, the Solar’s anima automatically increases by one level, an effect which cannot be muted by any means. This Charm may be used once per scene, but can be reset by a two point stunt which may include the activation of this Charm. At Essence 5+, this Charm becomes Reflexive and may be used during phases of Wyld-Shaping Technique.
