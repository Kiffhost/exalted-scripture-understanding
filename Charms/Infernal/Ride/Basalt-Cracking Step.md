*The Infernal’s steed asserts her authority upon the world with terrible weight, increasing its mass and momentum to an impossible scale in a surge of might.*

The Infernal’s mount shatters the ground beneath it whenever it moves between range bands, turning everything within close range of her path into difficult terrain. (This doesn’t impede her own movement.) It’s difficult to forcibly move it as if it had Legendary Size (Exalted, p. 274), though this doesn’t benefit doesn’t apply to the Infernal herself.

If the mount moves over an easily breakable, mundane surface, like a teahouse roof or a tree’s branches, it instead smashes directly through it, dropping downward without suffering falling damage. It may move one range band horizontally while falling.
## [[Keys]]
#### Palace-Toppling Rampage
If an obstacle blocks the mount’s movement, it may reflexively make a feat of strength to break through it, adding its Speed bonus to the roll. It can also make a feat of strength to smash through harder, more resilient surfaces like stone floors.
#### Moonfall Impact Stomp (Ride 5, Essence 2) (2m, 1i)
When the mount moves between range bands, the Infernal may pay two motes and one Initiative to unleash a shockwave of force out to close range from its path. This is a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage (Infernal’s Strength)B.
#### Continuous Ruinous Motion (Ride 5, Essence 3) (+3m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene.
