*Embodying the principle of annihilation, the Abyssal is untouched by lesser destruction.*
When the Abyssal uses either of this Charm’s prerequisites, she gains ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) soak and [[Hardness]] 20. Withering attacks against her subtract ([[Essence]]) dice of post-soak damage.
This protection ends if the Abyssal is crashed or if she goes a round without either making a decisive attack or spending 8+ motes on offensive [[Charms]].
