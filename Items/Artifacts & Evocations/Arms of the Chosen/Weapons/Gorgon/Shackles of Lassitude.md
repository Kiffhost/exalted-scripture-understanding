Gusts of lethargy clutch at the Exalt’s foes, holding them close. When an opponent attempts to disengage from the wielder, this Evocation changes (Wakefulness) successful dice on the disengage roll to failures, starting with 10s and working down. When this Evocation causes a non-trivial foe to botch a disengage roll, Gorgon’s Wakefulness rises by one step.
