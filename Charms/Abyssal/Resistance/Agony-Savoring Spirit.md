*The deathknight savors the exquisite pleasure of agony, drawing power from pain.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after being hit by a decisive attack but before the damage roll. She gains one mote for every die on the damage roll that rolls a success. This includes dice that are rerolled into failures with Far Beyond Ruin or similar defensive magic, but she doesn’t gain additional motes if rerolled dice succeed again.
The Abyssal can’t gain more than (Stamina) motes per round from this Charm. With Resistance 5, Essence 3, this increases to (Stamina x2).
With a Resistance 4, Essence 2 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm for a cost of two Initiative to exchange four motes granted by it for one Willpower.
(Exchanged motes still count toward the maximum).
A third purchase at Resistance 5, Essence 3 lets the Abyssal use this Charm for a cost of one Willpower to exchange motes for Initiative.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by being hit by a decisive attack with 10+ damage dice without being damaged.
