The Dragon-Blood moves with the fury of the waves to strike away enemies on all sides. She rolls a single withering attack against up to ([[Essence]]) enemies in close range, moving through a fluid sequence of blows to attack and pummel them all. If her [[Initiative]] is higher than that of at least one target, she can instead attack ([[Essence]] + 2) enemies. She rolls withering damage separately against each enemy, but only gains [[Initiative]] from the single highest damage roll. If she crashes at least one foe, a geyser of water erupts from beneath her feet and traces the arc of her blows, knocking all crashed enemies hit by the attack prone.
