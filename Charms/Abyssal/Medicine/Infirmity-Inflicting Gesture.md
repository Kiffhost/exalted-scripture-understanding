*Striking with surgical precision, the deathknight severs the flow of Essence through her victim’s meridians.*
The Abyssal makes one of the following gambits with (Dexterity + Medicine). This is usually an unarmed attack, but it can also use needles and other weapons with the Subtle tag. Any extra successes on a gambit’s Initiative roll cause the deathknight’s victim to lose that much Initiative.
Creeping Rigor Affliction (Difficulty 5): The Abyssal renders a limb numb, inflicting a −3 crippling penalty on rolls using that limb. Numbing an arm leaves the victim unable to use it for any actions and causes the victim to drop anything he was holding with it.
Numbing both legs causes him to fall prone and leaves him unable to rise.
Meridian-Charring Agony (Difficulty 3): The Abyssal sets her victim’s meridians ablaze with agitated Essence, increasing his wound penalty by −1. If his total wound penalty equals or exceeds an action’s difficulty, he can’t place that action in a flurry. If the action was already incompatible with flurries, his wound penalty subtracts successes instead.
Sense-Stripping Gesture (Difficulty 4): The Abyssal suppresses one of her victim’s senses, inflicting a −3 penalty on relevant rolls.
Snuffed Candle Curse (Difficulty 2): The Abyssal suppresses her victim’s natural vitality. He doesn’t heal naturally and loses the benefits of Exalted Healing (Exalted, pp. 165–166) if he has it. He suffers a −4 penalty to resist illness or poison.
The crippling effects inflicted by these gambits last until a character receives at least an hour of medical treatment, requiring an (Intelligence + Medicine) whose difficulty is the same as the relevant gambit’s.
With a Medicine 5, Essence 5 repurchase, this Charm’s effects can be used to make a damaging decisive attack with an appropriate weapon. The Abyssal may inflict one of the above effects by forgoing one level of damage, though the attack must deal at least 2+ damage.
