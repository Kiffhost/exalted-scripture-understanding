While in Aura, a Dragon-Blooded wielder may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to grant the Balanced keyword (Dragon-Blooded, p. 163) to all [[Charms]] of the next element in the cycle that she uses in one instant.
Dragon-Blooded with [[Inverted Cycle Attainment]] can instead grant Balanced to [[Charms]] of the previous element in the cycle (but not both at once).
