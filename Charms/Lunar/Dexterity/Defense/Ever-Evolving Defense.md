*Dancing between myriad shapes, the Lunar is too unpredictable to be caught.*
If she uses [[Quicksilver Second Face]] against an attack that misses her, she gains two [[Initiative]]. With a [[Dexterity]] 4 repurchase, she can pay a four-mote surcharge to use [[Quicksilver Second Face]] after an attack is rolled, as long as she takes on a form she hasn’t previously used that scene. This surcharge is waived while using [[Constant Quicksilver Rearrangement]] (p. XX).
