Through tapping the elemental, refined forces of her own experience, the Solar may access the most pristine and formless center of her own [[Essence]], from which all things may be derived. This Charm may be used after an (Attribute + [[Craft]]) roll, and grants one automatic non-Charm success and ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice. This Charm may not be used on basic projects. At [[Essence]] 3+, the dice bonus for this Charm is increased to ([[Intelligence]] + [[Essence]]).
