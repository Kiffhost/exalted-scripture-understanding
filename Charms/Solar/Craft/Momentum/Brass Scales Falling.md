*The Solar’s efforts fleet and flash before her eyes, bringing her closer to an ineffable truth.*
For each 10 on a [[Craft]] roll made without using the [[Craft]] Excellency, the Exalt earns a silver point, to a limit of ([[Essence]] * 2) points. This Charm may be repurchased, increasing the cap to ([[Essence]] * 3).
