*With mocking laughter, the Abyssal proclaims a curse upon her foe to deny him full sails and kind tides.*
The Abyssal lays a curse on an enemy who can hear her, rolling ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]) roll against her target’s [[Resolve]]. If she has a negative Tie to her target, she adds ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice. Success stirs the sea’s wrath against him:
 - He suffers a −1 penalty on all rolls he makes while traveling by water. This increases to −3 on [[Sail]] rolls, [[Survival]] rolls, and swimming-based [[Athletics]] rolls, and his 1s subtract successes on them.
 - Any ship he travels on halves its Speed and [[Maneuverability]], rounded down. If it has either of them at 0 or less, it’s reduced by one instead. or decreases them by one if they’re already at zero or below.
 - Sailors recognize the victim as cursed through their superstitions after a day of interaction with him. Once they do, they count as having a Minor Tie of fear, mistrust, or hatred towards him.
 - If he dies at sea or while stranded on an island, he’s doomed to linger as a ghost. The Abyssal senses the moment of his last breath regardless of distance.
This Charm counts as a sorcerous curse for magic capable of detecting and breaking them.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal can invoke [[Whispers]] to add ([[Whispers]]) non-Charm dice on the roll, instead of adding dice from a negative Tie.
