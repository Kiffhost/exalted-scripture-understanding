*The necromancer sews a corpse-monstrosity together to send into war, stitched together or bonded through rivets and grafts of soulsteel and dark iron.*
This spell requires sufficient materials: animal or human corpses, significant quantities of bone, [[Materials#Soulsteel|soulsteel]], or other metals often mined in shadowlands or the Underworld, and similar necromantic wonders. After at least a week of work, the necromancer rolls ([[Intelligence]] + {[[Craft]] or [[Medicine]]}) against difficulty 7, though this is reduced by one for each of the following criteria she meets:
- She has a workforce of skilled assistants.
- She has ample materials and resources.
- She spends at least a month preparing her creation.
- The corpse-engine lacks Legendary [[Size]].
Success allows the necromancer to animate a titanic corpse-engine of the walking dead: centipedal siege ladders known as spine chains; hundred-handed brachial sapping arrays, able to dig tunnels beneath the earth and tear mortals apart with their many grasping limbs; and towering thousand-corpse goliaths, giants comprised of armor and moaning corpses able to shatter city walls and wrestle warstriders to the earth. The corpse-engine possesses a Defining Tie of obedience to the necromancer, which may not be altered by any means.
On a failure, the necromancer is still able to reanimate her corpse-engine, but with one of the following drawbacks:
- It may go berserk in battle, causing greater destruction than intended or disobeying orders at inconvenient times. An unrolled [[Shape Sorcery|Shape Necromancy]] action at short range may be required to regain control over the corpse-engine.
- It needs regular maintenance as its corpse-parts rot or weaken. These require weekly ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) rolls against difficulty 7, with the difficulty reduced by one each for a workforce of skilled assistants or ample materials and resources. Failure increases its [[Health Track#wound penalties|wound penalty]] by one until the next time the necromancer succeeds on this roll.
- It lacks an animating intelligence, requiring a ghost with Nemissary’s Ride or a similar effect to possess and direct it.
- Other quirks requiring maintenance or supervision of the Storyteller’s devising.
Treat any such quirks as a [[Flaws|Flaw]] (Exalted, p. 167) if the necromancer is meaningfully inconvenienced by them.
## Control
The necromancer may assemble her corpse-engine through will alone, tendrils of darkness assembling the monstrosity from its constituent parts. She always counts as having sufficient assistants to reduce the difficulty of rolls, and can make them with [[Occult]]. She may reestablish control over berserk corpse-engines at medium range, and may have similar benefits in mitigating other quirks.
## Distortion (15)
The distorting necromancer must be standing within short range of the corpse-engine.
Success inflicts a flaw as if the necromancer had failed on her roll to animate it.
PLEASE FORMAT AS QUICK CHARACTER IN A SIDEBAR Thousand-Corpse Goliath Nearly forty feet in height, a thousand-corpse goliath is a skeletal nightmare of soulsteel and bone, covered in thousands of handholds and spikes. When directed, zombies climb onto the body, impaling themselves on spikes and grasping handholds to act as the construct’s corpse-muscle, strapped onto its body to maintain its integrity. Its massive metal fists break fortifications, it can crush a company of soldiers beneath its ironclad feet.
[[Essence]]: 1; [[Willpower]]: 1; [[Join Battle]]: 8 dice Health Levels: −0x10/−1x10/−2x10/−4x10/Incap.
Actions: [[Feats of Strength]]: 10 dice (may attempt [[Strength]] 10 feats; see Corpse-Body Thews); Terrifying Moaning: 10 dice; Senses: 6 dice [[Appearance]] ([[Hideous]]) 7, [[Resolve]] 1, [[Guile]] 1 Combat [[Attack]] (Colossal Fist/Stomp): 9 dice (Damage 15L/5) [[Attack]] (Grapple): 8 dice (10 dice to control). Makes unopposed grapple rolls against smaller opponents, unless they use magic like [[Dragon Coil Technique]] (Exalted, p. 280).
Combat [[Movement]]: 12 dice Evasion: 1; Parry: 6 Soak/Hardness: 12/5 (see Corpse-Body Thews) [[Merits]] Corpse-Body Thews: The construct must be equipped with zombies before battle, taking about an hour to fully load the corpse-engine. Once loaded, the zombies cannot act independently, but they reinforce the goliath’s might, adding the loaded battle group’s ([[Size]]) to attack rolls, grapple rolls, feats of strength, soak, and [[Hardness]]. With [[Size]] 3+ zombies loaded on, the goliath doubles 8s on [[Feats of Strength]]. Once the goliath has arrived on the field of battle, it may spend two rounds disgorging all the zombies on its frame, but once this is done, they cannot be loaded back on quickly.
Blood of Writhing Corpses: The goliath may sacrifice a point of [[Size]] from its loaded zombies to take a crippling injury, shedding zombies to deflect a lethal blow to its inner components. Area of effect attacks which inflict 5+ levels of decisive damage likewise destroy enough zombies to lower the [[Size]] of the loaded zombies by one. Once per battle, while loaded with a [[Size]] 2+ group of zombies, the goliath may take reflexively shed a [[Size]] 1 battle group of zombies with poor [[Drill]] and [[Might]] 1 at its feet whenever it takes 3+ levels of decisive damage.
Dead Passenger Reprisal: While loaded with a [[Size]] 3+ group of zombies, the goliath’s outer layer of corpses attack any enemies attempting to grapple it, climb it, or attack it from close range with weapon without the Reaching tag. They inflict one die of withering damage each round, or one die of lethal damage if the target is in [[Initiative]] Crash.
Legendary [[Size]]: The construct suffers no onslaught penalties from attacks from smaller opponents, unless they’re magically inflicted. Withering attacks from smaller enemies cannot crash it unless they have at least 10 post-soak damage dice, although attackers still gain the full amount of [[Initiative]] damage dealt. Decisive attacks from smaller enemies cannot deal more than (3 + attacker’s [[Strength]]) levels of damage to it, not counting levels added by [[Charms]] or other magic.
Mindless: The construct treats all social influence as unacceptable.
Special Abilities Legion-Crushing Stomp: The goliath makes a decisive stomp attack against all enemies within close range, splitting [[Initiative]] evenly between them, rounded up.
Add the ([[Size]]) of the goliath’s loaded zombies before dividing its initiative. Once per scene.
