Discerning the fears and desires of those around her, the Lunar knows how best to embody them. She can use [[Fellow Hound Insight]] to determine whether a character has any positive or negative Ties toward a group or category that encompasses a human or animal shape she possesses. She might discern that a [[Guild]] merchant prince desires a Delzahn lover, or that a bandit leader fears insects crawling on his skin. She may either inquire into a character’s Ties toward a specific group, or ask without any particular group in mind, in which case the Storyteller chooses which [[Intimacy]] is revealed.
