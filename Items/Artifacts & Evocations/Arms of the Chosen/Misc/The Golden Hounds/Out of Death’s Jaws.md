The Golden Hounds were forged to bear others out of danger. In order to use this Evocation, the Exalt must move into close range of an ally. She may reflexively take a defend other action to protect him (Exalted, p. 196), using her (Evasion + Celerity) instead of her Parry. If she successfully defends her ward, both she and he may reflexively move one range band in the same direction. This doesn’t count as either character’s move action.
