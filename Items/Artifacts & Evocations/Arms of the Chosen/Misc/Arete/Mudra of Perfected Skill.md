Arete focuses and magnifies its wearer’s mastery of mortal skill, transforming it into something supernal. Once per scene, the wearer can reroll the lower of (Ability or [[Essence]]) failed dice, except for 1s, on a roll with an Ability this Evocation enhances in which Arete’s movements are an essential element to success. The Exalt may employ this Evocation to climb a rope or play an instrument with transcendent grace, but not to leap a chasm or sing. It cannot enhance [[Craft]] rolls to create an artifact or manse, or [[Occult]] rolls to cast a spell or complete a sorcerous working. 

## Special activation rules

If the wearer isn’t dissonant with orichalcum and rolls 5+ threshold successes on an action in support of a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]], this Evocation awakens at no cost, enhancing the rolled Ability. Whenever the wearer does so for an Ability not yet enhanced by this Evocation, it henceforth enhances that Ability as well. 

## Dissonant

A wearer dissonant with orichalcum chooses an Ability to enhance when she purchases this Evocation. She may enhance additional Abilities by spending 2xp per additional Ability. 

## Resonant

The first time the wielder awakens this Evocation, it applies to all her Caste and Favored Abilities, as well as the rolled Ability. She can reroll 1s, and does so before rerolling other failures.
