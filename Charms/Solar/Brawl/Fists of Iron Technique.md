This Charm allows the Exalt to parry lethal damage with her bare hands. In addition, her bare-handed decisive strike does lethal damage and her withering damage ignores (Essence + Intimacy) soak. The Intimacy in this context can be a Tie (as the Solar strikes a hated enemy or defends a beloved friend) or a Principle (as the Solar exults in the thrill of violence).
