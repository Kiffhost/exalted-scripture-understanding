The Lunar’s shadow-mind grows into a distinct self, a reflection of who she could have been. Upon purchasing this Charm, she designs an alternate set of Social and Mental Attributes to use while her shadow-mind is active. She may reallocate up to two dots each among her Social Attributes (Appearance, Charisma, and Manipulation) and her Mental Attributes (Perception, Intelligence, and Wits). She can’t reallocate dots from a Social Attribute to a Mental Attribute, or vice versa. If this lowers an Attribute below the minimum needed for any of the Lunar’s Charms, she loses access to that Charm while her shadow-mind is active (with the exception of this Charm and Shadow-Mind Meditation). Conversely, she may learn Charms whose minimums she meets only with her shifted Attributes, but can only access them while her shadow-mind is active (or if she subsequently raises her true Attributes to meet their minimum). Similarly, she gains Excellencies if her altered traits qualify for them, or loses them if they don’t (p. XX).
