*The necromancer bites her cheek until blood flows thick in her mouth, enticing her lower soul to leap forth from her body with a hundredfold strength.*
The necromancer exhales a cloud of blue fog and tendrils that takes the form of a battle group of hungry ghosts (Exalted, p. 503) that resemble her. The battle group appears within close range of the necromancer.
It has Size (1 + the necromancer’s wound penalty, maximum 3), elite Drill, and Might 2, and gains the necromancer’s permanent Willpower. Slain hungry ghosts dissolve into a blue mist that floats about the battlefield. At the scene’s end, they all disperse into the mist and flow back into the necromancer’s mouth.
The necromancer can use the following powers while this spell is active:
Devouring Entrails Formation (5m; Reflexive; Until the engage action ends): When the battle group makes an engage action (Exalted, p. 209), its Initiative cost is waived, and it doubles 10s on the damage rolls of decisive attacks. It can also take restrain actions. Once per scene.
Infinite Hunger Reconstitution (8m, 1wp; ### Simple; Instant)
The necromancer may restore her swarm of hungry ghosts from the blue fog, making a special (Stamina + Occult) rally for numbers roll. Each success restores one Magnitude. If this fills the battle group’s Magnitude track, it gains a dot of Size, up to the Size it possessed when first summoned. Once per scene, unless reset when the battle group kills a nontrivial opponent.
Soul-Horde Synchronicity (5m; ### Reflexive; Instant)
The necromancer guides her lower soul’s manifold actions with her mind, rolling a command action with (Wits + Occult). She can flurry it with other actions, including attacks, and ignores flurry penalties.
## Reset
Once per scene.
## Control
The necromancer’s blood possesses an uncanny blue tint when spilled, tendrils writhing beneath its surface. She has a unique rapport with hungry ghosts, who count as having a Minor Tie of kinship to the necromancer. Hungry ghosts with a lower Essence won’t attack her unless compelled through magic.
Those with equal or greater Essence must spend one Willpower to initiate hostilities against her.
## Distortion (8)
Distortion reduces the battle group’s Drill to average and Might to 1, weakening the strength of the horde’s coordination.
