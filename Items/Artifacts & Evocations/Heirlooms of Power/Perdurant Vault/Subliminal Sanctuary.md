*Perdurant Vault shelters the wielderâ€™s psyche behind an ephemeral spiritual wall.*
The wielder gains +2 [[Resolve]] against an influence roll, or negates the [[Guile]] penalty for being unaware of an observer on a single roll. 

## Resonant

Each time a character resonant with jade uses this Evocation, the cost of subsequent activations in the same scene is cumulatively discounted by one mote, to a minimum of zero.
