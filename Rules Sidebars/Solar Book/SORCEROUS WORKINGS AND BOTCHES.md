Unlike most extended actions, botching a roll to complete a sorcerous working doesn’t automatically ruin the entire effort—instead, it adds a complication to the outcome of the overall project, whether it is a success or a failure. If the working is completed successfully, then the Storyteller should come up with one complication to its outcome for each botch.
<details><summary>Example</summary>A loyal minion created by a botched working might require a diet of solid gold, or a blessing laid on a field might be disrupted by the presence of any steel tools.</details>

These complications shouldn’t negate the core benefit of the working, but should introduce narratively interesting difficulties for the players to work around. On a failed working, each botch becomes a disastrous consequence of the working. 
<details><summary>Example</summary>A failed working to create a servitor results not in a useless heap of inanimate flesh, but in a sorcerous creation that is berserk and hell-bent on the destruction of its creator. A failed enchantment to fortify the walls of a town against dematerialized spirits turns patches of the walls themselves immaterial, breaching them for opposing armies.</details>
