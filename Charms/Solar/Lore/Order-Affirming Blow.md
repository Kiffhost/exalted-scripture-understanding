*The ravages of the Wyld and alterations to the Loom of Fate can be reversed by the [[Solar Exalted]].*
With this Charm, the Solar can shatter the twisting effects of magic and the Wyld, stripping away all such effects and restoring a target to his natural state. If the target does not want to be touched, this can be executed socially with a successful [[Larceny]] vs. [[Awareness]] contest to clandestinely touch the target, or if the target is a bit more incautious, the Solar may attempt to seduce him in order to deliver the touch. In combat, this Charm is a difficulty 5 gambit made with the Solar’s chosen hand-to-hand combat Ability. Fair Folk touched by this Charm are not undone, but experience a temporary transformation lasting (Solar’s [[Essence]]) scenes, whose severity is based on an [[Intimacy]] the Fair Folk has for the Solar, as well as its context. If the Fair Folk has no [[Intimacy]] for the Solar, the Storyteller may decide how it is changed. The Fair Folk’s player may also veto any changes to their character that makes him virtually unplayable or helpless.
