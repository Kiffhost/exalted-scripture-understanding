*The Lunar draws mythic potential into reality, speaking legends into being.*
This Charm can be used on an artifact that’s partially completed or in the process of repairs, which must have already accumulated successes equal to at least half the goal number required to create or repair it, rounded down (Exalted, p. 241). It temporarily becomes fully functional. For the Lunar, its attunement cost is reduced by five motes. An unfinished artifact needn’t precisely match the capabilities it will have when completed. If its rating is 3+, the Lunar’s player and the Storyteller should collaboratively design one Evocation the finished artifact might have, which the Lunar and her Solar mate can awaken without spending experience points. Other [[Evocations]] can be awakened normally. The Lunar may continue working to complete or repair the artifact while this Charm is active. 
This Charm may only be used once per story, unless reset by completing or fully repairing an artifact enhanced with it.
