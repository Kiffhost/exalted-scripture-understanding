*With a flourish, the wielder bats her foe’s weapon from his hand with [[Imprimatur]].*
If her disarm gambit succeeds, she also treats its [[Initiative]] roll as either a persuade roll to convince the foe to cease or deescalate hostilities, or as an inspire roll to fill him with shame, embarrassment, or frustration. 

## Resonant

The wielder’s influence roll targets all who witness the disarm gambit, ignoring the penalty for multiple targets.
