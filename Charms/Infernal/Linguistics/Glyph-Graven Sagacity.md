*Sigils of still-bleeding ink tattoo the Infernal’s skin, shifting and writhing through countless languages as they proclaim her genius to the world.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- She becomes fluent in Old Realm. If she already speaks it, her fluency is immune to any magic that would erase her knowledge of Old Realm, prevent her from using it through vocal or written communication at all, or the like.
- She adds an automatic success on Linguistics rolls that don’t involve social influence, and on Investigation, Lore, and Socialize rolls about written alphabets, translation, language families, and similar topics.
- She can read a page of text in a second, and longer texts in no more than ten minutes.
- After reading a text, she can tell whether it was written by a demon or a similar being, like an Infernal or a Demon-Blood. This doesn’t reveal the author’s identity.
