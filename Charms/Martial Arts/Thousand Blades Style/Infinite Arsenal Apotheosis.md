*Calling upon her bond to each weapon in her arsenal, the Thousand Blades master wreathes them in their own iconic displays of power.*
The stylist may pay a ten-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Thousand Blades Form]] to gain the following benefits:
- She adds (Arsenal/2, rounded up) to her base [[Initiative]] and to the [[Initiative]] she receives for crashing enemies.
- With Arsenal 3+, she may pay three [[Initiative]] to make a decisive counterattack once per round. With Arsenal 5+, she may reflexively clash instead of counterattacking.
- She can defend against [[environmental hazards]] with [[Defense|Parry]] instead of an opposed roll.
- Weapons wielded with [[Thousand Blades Unsheathed]] can’t be disarmed or damaged.
While using this Charm, the stylist’s weapons radiate light as a bonfire anima (Exalted, p. 175) 
## Special activation rules
If the stylist uses [[Thousand [[Daiklave]] Wings]] together with this Charm, she waives that Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost.
## Mastery
Weapons wielded with [[Thousand Blades Unsheathed]] are immune to Shaping effects. With Arsenal 5+, the stylist can block unblockable attacks.
## Terrestrial
The stylist adds only +1 to her base [[Initiative]] and [[Initiative]] Breaks. Counterattacking or clashing counts as her attack for the round.
