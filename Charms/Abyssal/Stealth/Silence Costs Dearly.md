*Dredging up hidden sins and buried secrets, the Abyssal blackmailer controls her victims with chains of shame and fear.*
When the Abyssal succeeds on a roll with [[Hidden Eye Surveillance]], [[Midnight Vigil Inquisition]], or [[Witness of Unspoken Shame]], she can pay one [[Willpower]] to bank her extra successes. She can add up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) banked successes as a non-Charm bonus when she takes the following actions against the victim of her surveillance:
 - [[Influence]] rolls that leverage an [[Intimacy]] revealed by the roll that triggered this Charm.
 - [[Threaten]] rolls to blackmail him with information gathered through surveillance.
 - Read intentions, profile character, or [[Awareness]] rolls to uncover additional information related to what her surveillance has uncovered.
 - [[Lore]] rolls relevant to what her surveillance has uncovered.
 - Raising her [[Resolve]] or [[Guile]] against him, gaining +1 per success.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm against, any previously banked successes are lost.
