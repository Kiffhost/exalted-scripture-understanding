This Charm allows the Solar to complete up to an hour of medicaltreatmentinahandfulofseconds.UsingthisCharm lowers the treatment time required for one Simple-type [[Medicine]] Charm. The Solar still requires the proper medicines and surgical tools, but may eliminate the need for such with a properly medical stunt, such as tapping her patient’s pressure points to increase the flow of [[Essence]] or massaging a person’s heart until it starts beating.
