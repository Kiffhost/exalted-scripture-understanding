The Lawgiver suffuses her body with Essence, becoming a virtual killing machine, her arms swinging like trip hammers. This Charm creates a series of up to ([half Strength or Stamina, rounded up] + 1) attacks against a single target, dividing the Solar’s Initiative up evenly for each strike, then adding bonus Initiative sufficient to raise the damage of all of them to equal the highest’s. In addition, for every blow that lands, the damage of the next is increased by the number of 10s in the previous damage roll.
