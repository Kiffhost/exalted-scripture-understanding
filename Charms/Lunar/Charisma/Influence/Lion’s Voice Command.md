The Lunar’s vocal cords shift to amplify her voice, her words rolling forth like thunder. She renders a spoken threaten or inspire roll, or ten seconds of regular speech, audible out to (Essence + Charisma) range bands. She ignores distance-based and environmental penalties, and can be heard over even the loudest noises. Once the Lunar has used this Charm, she waives the Willpower cost of subsequent activations for the scene. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Legendary Size, this Charm’s Willpower cost is waived. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has a threaten or intimidate dice pool may learn this as a Strength Charm, with Yeddim’s-Back Method (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
