*The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s skill in weathering difficult climes lets her protect her allies from even the most hostile environments, leading them through searing desert or frozen tundra.*
She may protect herself, her Sworn Kin, and ([[Essence]]) additional characters. The Exalt must spend five minutes in one-on-one training and preparations with each beneficiary. Each protected character gains a temporary [[Resistance]] specialty in withstanding his current environment, and ignores (her [[Essence]]) in environmental penalties from harsh climes. Up to five Dragon-Blooded who know this Charm can use it cooperatively. Each additional Exalt adds +1 to the effective [[Essence]] of the user to determine how many additional characters can be protected and the amount of penalty reduction.
