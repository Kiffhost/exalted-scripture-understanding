**Example Manse**: An elegant pavilion of bleached bone, surrounded by manicured lawns whose purple grasses surge with blood instead of dew every morning.
When socketed into a weapon, this stone — like a great blood clot in color and shape — empowers its bearer’s attacks. When she lands a decisive [[attack]] that increases a nontrivial enemy’s [[Health Track#wound penalties|wound penalty]] or incapacitates him, she adds a non-Charm bonus die on her next attack roll with that weapon. She loses this benefit if she doesn’t attack by the end of her next turn.
