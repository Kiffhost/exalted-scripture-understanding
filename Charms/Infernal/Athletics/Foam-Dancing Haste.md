*The Infernal is above wallowing in gore, darting over rivers of blood without sinking into them.*

As long as the Infernal moves at full speed without stopping, she can move over unstable surfaces, including water. She never risks damaging or breaking thin or flimsy surfaces, and isn’t affected by environmental hazards whose surface she runs over. This Charm ends if she stops moving.
### Keys 
#### Gravity-Rebuking Grace (Athletics 4) (+3m)
For a three-mote surcharge, the Infernal can also move up or down sheer vertical surfaces like walls or move upside down on horizontal surfaces like ceilings. If this Charm ends while she’s somewhere she couldn’t normally stand and she doesn’t renew it on her turn, she falls as usual.
#### Running to Forever (Athletics 5, Essence 3, [[Wind-Born Stride]] x3)
The Infernal permanently gains the ability to move across unstable surface. She must still use this Charm to gain protection against environmental hazards. If she has [[#Gravity-Rebuking Grace (Athletics 4) (+3m)|Gravity-Rebuking Grace]], she permanently gains the ability to move down vertical surfaces or upside down on horizontal ones, but must still use this Charm to move up surfaces.
