The Exalt leaps with the speed and grace of a striking hawk. Using this technique, a Solar may automatically leap forward or straight up one range band. A Solar using this Charm can easily leap to the top of a twenty foot wall or cross a Nexus street over rooftops, without having to roll. This Charm counts as the Solarâ€™s movement for the turn. If the Solar continues to leap to a different range band each turn, the cost is reduced to one mote after the first activation.
