Even for the unjustly wronged, there comes a time to strike back. Scratching over the invisible lines of her enemyâ€™s Essence meridians with an attack, the Black Claw stylist taints them with a bilious green poison, distilled from her own malice. The poison created by Flexing the Emerald Claw has Damage 2i/round, Duration (Essence + Manipulation) rounds, and a -2 penalty. While Black Claw Form is active, any Initiative damage dealt to an enemy by this poison awards that many points of Initiative to the martial artist (even if the damage is converted to lethal against a crashed enemy).
