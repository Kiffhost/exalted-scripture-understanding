*The stylist exerts overwhelming pressure, building to this style’s signature technique: breaking an enemy’s fighting spirit and maiming his flesh with monstrous force.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have 5+ rounds of grapple control. Her enemies have until her next turn to stop her from unleashing her finishing move. They can do so either by breaking the grapple or crashing the stylist, ending this Charm.
If the stylist isn’t stopped, on her next turn, she takes all of the grappled foe’s Initiative, crashing him. This uses her entire turn. If her enemy has any crippling penalties from this style’s Charms, he suffers levels of damage equal to his total penalty unless he accepts a crippling injury, which doesn’t count toward the once-per-story limit (Exalted, p. 201).
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by dealing 10+ decisive damage with a savaging attack.
## Mastery
Successfully crashing her foe lets the stylist reflexively make a decisive savaging attack against him.
## Terrestrial
The stylist can’t steal more than (Strength + rounds of grapple control) Initiative.
