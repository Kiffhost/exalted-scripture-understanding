*Making the Superior Sign of the Corpse, the Sidereal confronts the living with their own mortality.*
The Sidereal makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [[Medicine]]) persuade roll against a living character. Success places him in a special [[Decision Points|Decision Point]]. If he cites a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that supports accepting his mortality, he gains one [[Willpower]] and the [[Intimacy]] is reinforced for the rest of the story. [[Influence]] rolls to weaken it use the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221). A character without an applicable [[Intimacy]] is haunted by his mortality, gaining the Megrims [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 169) at Major intensity. He must make a [[Willpower]] roll against it when he becomes aware of a serious and imminent threat to his life. Failing a roll against it in combat also causes him to lose (Siderealâ€™s [[Essence]]) [[Initiative]]. He can end his Megrims by upholding a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] in a way that reflects his acceptance of mortality.
