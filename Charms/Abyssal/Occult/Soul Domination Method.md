*Casting her spirit outward, Death’s Lawgiver invades another’s soul, sifting through his mind and warping his spirit to her will.*
The Abyssal rolls (Wits + Occult) against the Resolve of a willing, unconscious, or restrained target to invade his mindscape. If successful, she can invoke one of the following effects
- Roll against a target’s Guile to sift through his memories, seeking a specific piece of information or to look for signs of spiritual or mental maladies, like possession. She may suffer a penalty if the memories she seeks out are old or somehow obscured. She can make Perceptionbased rolls and use Charms to examine these memories for information her target missed.
- Inflict a Minor Derangement (Exalted, p. 168).
If the Derangement relates to one of her target’s Major or Defining Intimacies, he gains it at Major intensity instead. Alternatively, the Abyssal can strengthen an existing Derangement by one step. She can’t use this effect against a character more than once per story.
- Feed on a character’s higher or lower soul, stealing one Willpower from him. Feeding on the higher soul weakens all of a character’s emotion-based Intimacies by one step, while feeding on the lower soul weakens all of his unemotional Intimacies by one step. He can pay one Willpower to preserve his Defining Intimacies.
A character without any such Intimacies loses an additional Willpower to the Abyssal.
- Devour a spirit of equal or lesser Essence, either destroying it permanently or absorbing it with Spirit-Devouring Appetite. If she uses SpiritDevouring Appetite, its total cost is reduced by (Abyssal’s Essence + spirit’s Essence) motes, minimum one.
- Unleash a possessing entity devoured with Divinity-Banishing Contempt to take control of the target.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, this Charm can be used for other esoteric interactions with someone’s mind or soul, though it’s not capable of repairing damage to either or otherwise alleviating mental or spiritual conditions.
With an Essence 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm to heal minds as well as harm them, like subverting a Psyche effect afflicting her Lunar mate, entering a raksha’s spiritual maw to rescue shards of a victim’s psyche, or perform similar feats. The Abyssal’s player should work out the specific effects of this with the Storyteller.
