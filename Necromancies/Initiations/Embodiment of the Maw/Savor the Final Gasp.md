*When the necromancer kills a nontrivial opponent, she gains (his [[Essence]]) necromantic motes.*
She gains one necromantic mote when slaying a trivial opponent or causing a [[battle group]] to suffer [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] damage, if she stunts slaughtering her enemies. These necromantic motes last for the sceneâ€™s duration. When contributed to her control spell, she may count each necromantic mote gained this way twice. This shaping ritual can provide no more than 10 necromantic motes in a single scene.
