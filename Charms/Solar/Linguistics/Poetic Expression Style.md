Through gesture, movement, and carefully shaped facial expressions, the Solar may clearly communicate short, simple sentences through body language and pantomime. This Charm ignores the penalty for such communications, and allows for additional complexity, but does not allow for poesy. Therefore, “Open the gates now, or I will return with an army,” is valid, while “Fill your hands with steel and prepare to dance, you devils,” is not. As such, all social influence made with this Charm suffers a three success penalty.
