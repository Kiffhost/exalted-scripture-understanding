*The Abyssal’s arrow shares her hunger for the world’s end, drawing in and devouring all light.*
If the Abyssal’s attack hits, it extinguishes all light sources other than anima banners that her projectile passed within short range of while in flight. Mundane light sources are snuffed out, while magical lights return once the scene ends.
If the attack’s target has an anima banner, it’s reduced by one level if he suffers withering damage or resets to dim if he’s crashed. Against decisive attacks, he loses one anima for each level of damage he suffers.
When used outside of combat, no roll is required unless the deathknight attempts a particularly difficult shot.
