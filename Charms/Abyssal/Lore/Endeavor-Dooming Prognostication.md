*Death’s Lawgiver pronounces her enemies’ failure with infallible foresight, crushing the hopes of those who fail to heed her.*
The Abyssal can pay an eight-mote surcharge when she uses Bleak Wisdom Malison to apply its penalties not just to her target, but everyone who takes part in the affected plan or agenda. (She doesn’t need to beat their Resolve). Additionally, that agenda will face at least one major narrative obstacle as a result of its fatal flaw. A warlord’s dreams of conquest might be stymied as crop blights leave her legions with empty stomachs, while a sorcerer’s working might draw vengeful shades of those slain by sorcery to him.
