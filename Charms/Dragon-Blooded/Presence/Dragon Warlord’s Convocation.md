Heartstring-Pulling Approach The Dragon-Blood forges loyalty with fiery words, overawing and inspiring those who hear her. She makes an instill roll against a single character with ([Charisma or Appearance] + [[Presence]]), doubling 9s, to create a Tie of loyalty towards her. This creates an [[Intimacy]] at Major intensity, or strengthens a Minor or Major [[Intimacy]] to Defining intensity. If the target wishes to resist, he must enter a Decision Point, calling on another [[Intimacy]] of equal or greater intensity and paying two [[Willpower]]. For the remainder of the story, the target cannot voluntarily weaken this [[Intimacy]] unless the Dragon-Blood directly harms him or threatens one of his Major or Defining Intimacies. Even then, he can only weaken it by one level for each offense. [[Dragon Warlordâ€™s Convocation]] can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).
