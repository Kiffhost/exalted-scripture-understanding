*The deathknight lays low mighty temples and palaces, making their rubble monuments to her might.*
The Abyssal can activate this Charm after destroying a structure with a difficulty 10+ feat of demolition.
The structure’s ruins and the land out to one mile from them are cursed:
 - The cursed land counts as a shadowland until the end of the story or until the Abyssal uses this Charm again. It doesn’t open into the Underworld. If the deathknight uses this Charm in the Underworld or a shadowland, the ruins instead draw specters and other undead afflicted with [[Whispers]] to it.
 - A Defining [[Blight]] chosen by the Abyssal afflicts the land, lasting until at least the end of the current story.
 - The first time someone sees the ruins, he’s instilled with a fear-based [[Intimacy]] if the feat’s successes exceed his [[Resolve]]. The Abyssal chooses the [[Intimacy]] upon using this Charm. For instance, a ruined Immaculate temple might spread a Principle that the Immaculate [[Order]] is powerless against the dead. Mortals and [[Essence]] 1 ghosts must spend three [[Willpower]] to resist this influence, while trivial characters are automatically affected and can’t resist with [[Willpower]].
 - If the feat upholds a negative Defining [[Intimacy]], the ruins permanently become a lesser Abyssal demesne. If the feat accomplished a legendary social goal, it forms a greater demesne.
