Tuning her understanding of martial Essence through her dedicated weapon-mastery, the Solar can momentarily achieve flawless combat efficiency. Once per scene, the Exalt may use a full Melee Excellency, paying only a single willpower to activate the Charm. Perfect Strike Discipline can be reset by incapacitating an opponent with a Melee attack.
