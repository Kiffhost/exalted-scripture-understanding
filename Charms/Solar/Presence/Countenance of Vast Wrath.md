While under the effects of the prerequisite, the Solar draws in her anima, shedding it completely. As she ends the Charm’s commitment, she draws her power inward, channeling it into a new and more terrifying form. This Charm adds (Essence) dice to the Lawgiver’s single-target threaten actions, and allows her to terrorize even those creatures who are incapable of fear. In combat, opponents suffer the loss of a single point of Initiative on each round in which they do not direct an attack at her. At Essence 5+, when the character returns to bonfire, she resumes the effects of Terrifying Apparition of Glory automatically and for free. Characters who fail their Resolve checks must pay additional Willpower and Initiative to remain in battle. This Charm cannot be muted with the Night Caste anima or other magic. Resistance
