The Great Curse isnâ€™t meant to punish players. The Storyteller should use it to create dramatic moments or conflicts for a deathknight that will be enjoyable for the players, if not for their characters. Keep this in mind both when deciding when to invoke Expiation and when choosing effects. Choosing multiple Minor effects may be less harsh than a single Major or Defining one, but it may set up a better moment in the story.
