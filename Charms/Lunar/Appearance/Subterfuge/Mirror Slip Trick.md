The Lunar dwells in Creation’s secret corners — dreams, shadows, and even reflections. While touching a reflective surface, she can physically enter it, becoming a living reflection. She doubles 9s on [[Stealth]] rolls within the mirror. She can perceive the outside world and speak with characters in it but has no physical presence and can’t leave the mirror without ending this Charm. She’s vulnerable to attacks capable of striking dematerialized foes. If the mirror is shattered or damaged beyond usability, this Charm ends; the Lunar is forcefully ejected and loses five [[Initiative]]. However, this Charm renders the reflective surface supernaturally durable, adding ([[Essence]]) to the difficulty of feats of strength to destroy it. Alternatively, the Lunar can use this Charm with Instant duration to escape a mirror or similar surface she’s been magically trapped in. With an [[Appearance]] 4, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Lunar can pay five motes to travel from the reflective surface she inhabits to another such surface within short range (medium range if she has [[Appearance]] 5, [[Essence]] 5) as her move action. She must be able to see her destination but doesn’t need an unobstructed path. This movement doesn’t require a new [[Stealth]] roll.
