*Shrouding her killing intent in darkness, the Lunar remains unnoticed until she strikes.*
Her [[Stealth]] roll ignores the penalty to concealment in combat. Each enemy whose opposed roll she beats loses one [[Initiative]] (which she doesn’t gain). 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with [[Ambush]] Hunter, each 10 on the Lunar’s [[Stealth]] roll lets her gain one [[Initiative]] lost by an enemy this way.
