*The Solar can call her armor from conceptual Elsewhere— defined categorically as a point somewhere in existence that is “not here”—allowing her to don each piece of armor as if she were putting it on normally.*
If the Solar owns a [[Shield]], she may call it to hand as well. The Lawgiver can also send her armor Elsewhere through use of this Charm.
