*The demon Ruthesind, the Hanging Pilgrim, hides patterns and shapes of great truths in the twisted spire of his temple-sized body even as he dangles upside-down from a rope of braided neuronal flesh. Those who explore his corpse-dungeon uncover postures of mystical power in the statuary that makes up Ruthesind’s memory — though those who fail to placate him may not survive the descend. Ruthesind regularly hangs from the slopes of his progenitor Qaf, though his location is not always constant. Histories point to more distant appearances, recording sightings of him atop Creation’s mountains or beached in the depths of Cecelyne.*
