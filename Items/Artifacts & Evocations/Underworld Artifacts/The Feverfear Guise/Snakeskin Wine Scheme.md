*Looming over her patient with grim benevolence, the Guise’s master offers salvation in obedience.*
The wearer makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Medicine]]) persuade roll against a single character she’s diagnosed or infected with a disease to prescribe a course of treatment. This influence may leverage the disease as if it were an [[Intimacy]] of equal intensity. She ignores up to (Medicine/2, rounded up) points of penalty for making implausible claims, like recommending herring for a fever or avoiding gamblers for a broken arm.
As long as the patient follows the prescribed treatment, he can use the wearer’s base ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Medicine]]), including specialties, in place of his ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) for his next roll against the disease’s morbidity.. If he succeeds on the roll after following the wearer’s instructions, he gains a Minor Tie of trust to her, or a Major Tie if the disease was Major or Defining before the roll.
## Dissonant
The imposed Tie is only Major if the disease was originally Defining.
