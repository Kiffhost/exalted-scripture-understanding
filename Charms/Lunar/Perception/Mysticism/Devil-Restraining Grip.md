*Sighting the ephemeral divine, the Lunar drags it forcefully into form.*
To use this Charm, [[Spirit-Rending Fury]] must be active. The Lunar makes a grapple gambit against a dematerialized entity, setting the gambit’s difficulty to (higher of {the enemy’s [[Essence]] or 2}). She may roll ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) in place of ([[Strength]] + {Brawl or Martial Arts}) to establish control of the clinch, and successfully clinching the enemy renders him material for the grapple’s duration. 
## Protean 

In animal forms with Legendary [[Size]] or grappling-related abilities, the Lunar adds ([[Essence]]) dice on the attack and [[Initiative]] roll.
