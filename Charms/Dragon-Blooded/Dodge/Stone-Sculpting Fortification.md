The earth rises to enfold the Dragon-Blood, ensuring she has a place of safety to move into as she evades her foes. As long as there is any earth, stone, or similar material within close range, she can attempt a take cover action, creating an earthen barrier that provides light cover (Exalted, pp. 198199) if she succeeds. Alternatively, if she can take advantage of earthen or stone scenery that would normally provide light cover, a successful roll upgrades it to heavy cover, drawing loose soil or stones to fortify it. The environmental changes made by this Charm are permanent, and other characters can gain cover from the barrier created.
In Earth Aura, the Dragon-Blood doubles 9s on enhanced take cover actions.
