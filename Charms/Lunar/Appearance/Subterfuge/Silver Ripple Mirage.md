*Infinitely elusive and ephemeral, the Lunar sloughs off corporeality and inverts her nature, becoming a living reflection.*
While using [[Mirror Slip Trick]], she may use this Charm to emerge from a mirror in a dematerialized form. She’s quasi-visible, reflected in ripples of air and droplets of water vapor: Material characters can see her (but not perceive her using other senses) without needing magic, but suffer a –5 penalty on [[Perception]] rolls against her without magic. For one mote, a Lunar using this Charm can become tangible for a single action, letting her attack materialized characters or interact with physical objects (but rendering her vulnerable to counterattacks and clashes). Characters who lack magic for attacking dematerialized enemies can still attack her by directing their attack against a reflective surface within close range of her, wounding her but leaving the mirror unmarred. If no reflective surfaces exist, the Storyteller should be generous in letting opponents create one with gambits or stunts. When this Charm ends, the Lunar may reflexively use [[Mirror Slip Trick]] for free to enter a reflective surface within close range. Warfare
