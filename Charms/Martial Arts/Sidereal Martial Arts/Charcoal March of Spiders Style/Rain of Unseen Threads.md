*The martial artist casts strands of fate from her sleeves or fingertips, spinning reality itself into hair-fine threads.*
The stylist may create threads of Essence, with the following benefits
- She can use threads to take actions out to medium range: attacking with weapons, picking up or otherwise interacting with objects, or performing simple tasks that could be done with one hand. The threads are exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for weaving, climbing, laying snares, swinging between handholds, etc.
They’re also exceptional equipment for lifting or suspending heavy objects — a feat of strength rolled with (Wits + Martial Arts), using (Essence + Wits) instead of Strength to determine if the feat can be attempted.
- The stylist can attack with the threads. They’re light weapons with the Bashing, Martial Arts, Thrown (Medium), Disarming, Flexible, and Grappling tags. They count as style weapons.
- The stylist can still flurry while grappling an enemy with a thread and suffers no Defense penalty. If the stylist grapples an enemy from beyond close range, she can only take restrain or drag actions, and a character can sever the thread — ending the grapple — with a difficulty (stylist’s rounds of control) gambit. The stylist can have up to a total of (Wits) enemies grappled at a time. While grappling multiple enemies, on each, she may either restrain them all, expending two rounds of control over each of them; make a savaging attack against them; or release them. Withering savaging attacks use a single attack roll but roll damage separately against each grappled foe. Only the single highest withering damage roll awards Initiative. Decisive savaging attacks divide her Initiative evenly among all foes (rounded up) to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring Hardness.
