*The Abyssal speaks with a voice like a dead god, infecting her victims with the whispers of her own soul’s darkness.*
The Abyssal makes a special ({[[Charisma]], [[Manipulation]], or [[Wits]]} + [[Occult]]) [[influence roll]] against a single character she can perceive to infect his mind with [[Whispers]]. This influence is conveyed mentally, as with [[Screaming in Silence]]. If successful, her victim suffers a penalty of (Abyssal’s [[Whispers]]) on all rolls for the rest of the scene, and a penalty of (Whispers/2, rounded up) to [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]]. Any positive Principles he has are treated as one step weaker for the scene’s duration. This costs one [[Willpower]] to resist for a scene, and (Abyssal’s [[Whispers]]) [[Initiative]] in combat. The Abyssal gains any [[Initiative]] spent resisting it.
Alternatively, the Abyssal may use this Cham to grant another character [[Whispers]], letting them incur [[experience debt]]. She can’t grant [[Whispers]] at a rating higher than her own. These [[Whispers]] aren’t those of the Neverborn — they’re born of the Abyssal’s own unconscious darkness.
