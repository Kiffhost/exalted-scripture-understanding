Striking her patient’s anima with Essence-laden fingers, the Solar imparts a surge of new life. This Charm grants the target a number of -0 health levels equal to the Solar’s Essence. These -0 levels are the first to be checked off when the character is injured, and fade immediately when the Solar releases her commitment, taking any damage with them. This Charm can be used to staunch wounds and stop the flow of blood.
