The sorcerer may draw power from the forces of wind, rain, and storm, gaining two sorcerous motes each turn she takes while exposed to a thunderstorm, heavy winds, or other harsh weather. Rain showers or light gusts still offer some power, allowing her to gain (Essence) motes at the start of the scene but not on any subsequent turns. Taking damage from a weather-based environmental hazard gives her five motes per level of damage. These motes last for the duration of the scene.
