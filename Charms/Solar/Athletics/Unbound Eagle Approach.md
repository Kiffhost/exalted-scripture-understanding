It is the Solar’s nature to rise above. Meditating on the tyrannical bonds of gravity, the Exalt learns to separate her Essence from that which pulls her down. By paying two extra motes to the activation of Soaring Crane Leap, the Exalt may drift across a horizontal range band without initial thrust, allowing her to plane along low ceilings or avoid traps that might detect a more wild leaping motion. In addition, she can use this Charm on each round after activating Soaring Crane Leap to continue to glide across range bands without dropping down.
