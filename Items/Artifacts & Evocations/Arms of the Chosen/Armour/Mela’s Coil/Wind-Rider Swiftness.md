*Borne forward by the wind, the Exalt flashes forward at her foe.*
This Evocation can be used against an enemy at medium range or closer. The wearer advances one range band towards him and may reflexively roll to rush him. This counts as her movement action for the turn. If she attacks that opponent before the end of her next turn, her first such attack adds ([[Dexterity]]) bonus dice to its damage roll.
