**This Ability is important in combat.**

[[Awareness]] is the practiced discipline of alertness and wariness of one’s surroundings. It is used for rolls to notice or pick up on sensory information, but is also important in combat, adding to the [[Join Battle]] roll that determines a character’s starting [[Initiative]] and allowing her to notice hidden enemies.
