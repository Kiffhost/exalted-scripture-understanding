The Lunarâ€™s battle prowess renews the courage of those who fight beside her. If she hits with an attack, she reflexively makes an [[Appearance]]-based [[rally]] or [[rally for numbers]] action, adding bonus dice equal to the 10s on the attack and damage roll. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
