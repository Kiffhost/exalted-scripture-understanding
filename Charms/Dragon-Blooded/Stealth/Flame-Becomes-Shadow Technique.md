The Terrestrial shrouds the flame of her presence in smoke and shadows, diverting the attention of those who are most in awe of her. The Dragon-Blood rolls ([Manipulation or Appearance] + [[Stealth]]) against the [[Resolve]] of any character that has an [[Intimacy]] which supports deference or submission towards her â€” whether love, fear, or belief in Immaculate orthodoxy. The targeted [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] penalize [[Resolve]] as normal. Affected characters are incapable of perceiving the Dragon-Blood until she takes hostile action or chooses to reveal herself. An Immaculate monk could walk unnoticed into the midst of a meeting plotting sedition against the Realm, stepping forward from the shadows to pronounce judgment. A character that wishes to resist this unnatural influence must enter a Decision Point, calling upon an [[Intimacy]] of equal or greater strength than the one exploited and paying a point of [[Willpower]].
