Subtle [[Chameleon]] Practice The Lunar controls how others perceive her, including whether they perceive her at all. When a character rolls opposing the Lunar’s [[Stealth]], to see through her disguise, or to spot her [[Lunar Shapeshifting/Tell]], he suffers a −(her [[Appearance]] − his [[Resolve]]) penalty, minimum −1, and his 1s subtract successes. Those most driven to seek the Lunar are the most blinded to her presence — Ties of fear or lust toward the Lunar and [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that support finding or pursuing her penalize [[Resolve]] against this effect. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Camouflage, this Charm’s penalty subtracts successes, not dice.
