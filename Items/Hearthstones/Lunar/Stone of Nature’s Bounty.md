Anyone who falls asleep within three miles of this stone awakens the next day with an intuitive understanding of how to find nutritious food and pure water in their current environment. While it doesnâ€™t allow someone to find food or water where none exists, the stone grants a +2 bonus to all Survival rolls to find food or water in the area around the stone. This knowledge lasts until next time the person falls asleep.
