*This Evocation functions as [[Frozen [[Templates/sorcery]] - Emerald]], except that it freezes a spell of the Celestial Circle, the difficulty is (caster’s [[Essence]] + 5), and it can only be used once per story.*
This resets at the end of any scene in which the bearer defeats, suborns, or makes peace with an enemy sorcerer. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
