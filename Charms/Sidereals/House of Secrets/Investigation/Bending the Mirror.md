Tracing the successive strands of fate intertwined with her Exaltation, the Sidereal calls upon the wisdom of her past lives. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Sidereal’s player details one of their character’s previous incarnations. This includes a separate set of Intimacies for him, ([[Essence]]) of his [[Lore]] backgrounds, and (Sidereal’s languages) dots of Languages she spoke. Using this Charm grants the Sidereal access to her past life’s [[Lore]] backgrounds and languages. She gains one of his Intimacies at Major intensity, which she can’t voluntarily weaken until the end of the next scene. The Sidereal can use this Charm to introduce a fact based on one of her past life’s [[Lore]] backgrounds or to use his knowledge of a language to understand or make a single statement. Doing so causes her to gain one of his Intimacies at Minor intensity, which she can’t voluntarily weaken that scene. The Sidereal may pay three experience points or one bonus point to detail another past life, maximum (higher of [[Essence]] or 3). An [[Investigation]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Sidereal pay a three-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration indefinitely. The [[Intimacy]] conferred becomes Defining. She can’t voluntarily weaken it for this Charm’s duration.
