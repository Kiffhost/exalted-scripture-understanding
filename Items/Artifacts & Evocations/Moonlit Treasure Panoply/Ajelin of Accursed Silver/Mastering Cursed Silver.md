None can defy Ajelin’s curse forever, but a Lunar’s affinity for moonsilver aids her in bending the blade to her will.
The Lunar gains the following benefits:
 - She doesn’t need to roll to end her attunement to Ajelin.
 - She can withdraw or ready Ajelin reflexively.
 - [[Accursed Blade Embodiment]] doesn’t prevent her from voluntarily weakening Intimacies.
 - Once per session, when she suffers a disadvantage because of a choice not to use violence, she rolls (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice and loses [[Limit]] equal to her successes.
## Awakening
This Evocation awakens for free if the Lunar meets its prerequisites.
# AJELIN AND THE GREAT CURSE 
For Exalted who don’t have [[Limit]] Breaks, the Storyteller should choose an alternate effect to express this. For example, a Dragon-Blood’s Great Curse might award her experience from roleplaying the effects of Ajelin’s corruption, rather than her elemental temperament (Dragon-Blooded, p. 159).
