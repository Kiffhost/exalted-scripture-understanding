The Dragon-Blood erupts into a swift barrage of violence, her fists burning with raging [[Essence]]. To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 15+. She unleashes a rapid series of strikes, making a single decisive attack roll to launch (1 + the number of 10s on the attack roll) attacks against a single enemy, using the successes on her roll to determine if each attack hits. She doesn’t reset to base [[Initiative]] normally — instead, each successful attack reduces her [[Initiative]] by one for each die that shows a success on the damage roll, to a minimum of ([[Essence]]). Once she’s completed making all attacks, she resets to base [[Initiative]], even if they all missed. Every hit the Dragon-Blood lands inflames its victim’s [[Essence]] with inward fire, creating an ignition point that lasts until end of scene. Once the barrage of attacks has been completed, the Dragon-Blood or any of her allies can detonate a single ignition point by landing a decisive attack against this enemy. The first ignition point detonated deals one die of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]], the second deals two dice, and so on. If the Dragon-Blooded subsequently uses this Charm against an enemy still carrying undetonated ignition points, she cannot inflict any new ignition points on him. Once all his ignition points have been ignited, the damage of ignition points from a subsequent activation starts at one die, as usual.
