*The deathknight’s forces surround her foes, eager to feed upon suffering and death.*
The Abyssal can enact the [[Pincer Attack]] stratagem (Exalted, p. 212) when she or one of her allies empties an enemy battle group’s Magnitude track, or when an allied battle group crashes or incapacitates a nontrivial enemy. The stratagem’s onslaught penalty is doubled against the enemy targeted by the attack that triggered this Charm.
If the Abyssal is already fighting under a [[Pincer Attack]] stratagem she’s enacted, this Charm instead doubles its onslaught penalty against all enemies.
