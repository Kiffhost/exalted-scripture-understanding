Normally when a ship changes targets during naval combat, it loses all of its momentum. The Solar’s ship only builds a greater head of steam. Upon launching a naval maneuver which incapacitates an enemy vessel, the Solar may use this Charm to keep all of her ship’s momentum, and adds an additional momentum bonus equal to the enemy captain’s Essence.
