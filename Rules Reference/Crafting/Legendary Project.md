Legendary projects deal with the creation of the mightiest works of magical artifice known to the Chosen, and the resurrection of the lost glories of the First Age. Arduous and demanding even for the creative masters of the [[Twilight|Twilight Caste]], few legendary projects have even been attempted since the murder and exile of the [[Solar Exalted]], and their undertaking is widely considered a lost art in the Realm.
# Beginning
Legendary projects create N/A-scaled artifacts—wonders of such earth-shaking potency that the secrets of their design have been lost since the end of the First Age. Now, with the return of the [[Solar Exalted]], craftsmen once more walk the face of Creation with the skill, insight, and power to birth these transformative miracles and divine cataclysms into the world. 

In addition to the requirements of artifact crafting, attempting a legendary project requires [[Lore]] 5, [[Occult]] 5, [[Craft]] (Artifacts) 5, a relevant mundane [[Craft]] at 5, and an even greater volume and potency of magical materials and mystical prodigies. 
# Slot
Then, once the project is ready to begin, the character spends five [[Crafting Projects#Crafting Experience|white experience points]] to create a legendary crafting slot. Unlike superior slots, these slots require no fusing. Once a legendary project ends in success or failure, the slot vanishes.
# Finishing 
Attempting to finish a legendary project works like attempting to finish a [[Superior Project#Finishing|superior project]], with the following exceptions: The character must labor for at least ten years, attempting to finish costs 10 white points, and the extended roll to finish the project has a goal number of 200. 
# Reward
Successfully completing a legendary project in such a way that the character triggers at least one [[Crafting Projects#Basic Objectives|basic objective]] automatically grants the character 10 [[Crafting Projects#Crafting Experience|white experience points]]. Additionally, the character rolls a full free [[Craft]] Excellency. For each success, she gains 1 gold point. For each die that does not show a success, she gains 1 silver point. Unlike basic and [[Major Project|major projects]], the character doesn’t gain any additional rewards for triggering multiple basic objectives.
