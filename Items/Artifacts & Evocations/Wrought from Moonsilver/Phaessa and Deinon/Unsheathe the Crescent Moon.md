As the wielder’s combat stance shifts, Phaessa and Deinon follow suit. After successfully rushing a nontrivial opponent, she may activate this Evocation to make the swords waxing. After successfully establishing concealment against at least one nontrivial enemy, she may make the swords waning. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder reduces an enemy’s Initiative from higher than hers to lower than hers with a withering attack while the blades are waxing or incapacitates a nontrivial foe with a decisive attack while they’re waning. 

## Resonant

At Essence 3, the wielder may pay a one-anima surcharge to use this Evocation without needing to enhance an action. If this leaves her anima above dim, the swords become waxing; otherwise, they become waning.
