*Spirit-Chaining Strike Affixing a prayer strip to the forehead of a victim of possession, the Dragon-Blood speaks a potent incantation, setting the paper alight.*
This flame doesn’t burn the possessed character, but rather, the possessing entity. The Dragon-Blood rolls ({Charisma or Intelligence} + [[Occult]]) against the possessing being’s [[Resolve]]. Success deals (her [[Essence]] + threshold successes) dice of decisiveaggravated damage to the possessor, ignoring [[Hardness]]. If the total damage equals or exceeds that being’s [[Essence]] rating, it’s forced out of its host, and cannot attempt to possess him again for the rest of the story. Otherwise, the host can’t benefit from any use of this Charm until a day has passed. Up to five Dragon-Blooded who know this Charm can use it cooperatively. Each character beyond the first adds one additional die of damage.
