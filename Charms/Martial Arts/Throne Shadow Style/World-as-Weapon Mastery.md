*The vizier need not act to seize victory; the lessons she’s imparted to her shadow fingers have already ensured her triumph.*
The stylist can enhance the attacks of shadow fingers present in the same scene with the following techniques:
**Deadliest of All Weapons** (1m, 1wp; Supplemental; Decisive-only)
If a shadow finger’s decisive attack hits and his attack roll also beats his target’s Resolve, the stylist asks that enemy one question, which he must answer truthfully (in character). If he enters a Decision Point and cites a Defining Intimacy, he may pay one Willpower to give an answer that’s vague, misleading, or only half-true. Incapacitated enemies answer before succumbing to their wounds and can’t resist with Willpower.
**Flow-Breaking Strike** (1m, 1wp; Supplemental; Decisive-only)
Each 9 and 10 on a decisive attack also causes the enemy to lose one Initiative, which the shadow finger doesn’t gain.
**Pneuma-Sealing Strike** (5m; Reflexive; Withering-only)
After a withering damage roll, the shadow finger can forgo up to (his Essence + stylist’s Essence) Initiative awarded by it. Each point of Initiative forgone reduces the number of motes regained by the damaged enemy at the end of the round by one. If this exceeds the amount he’d recover, the excess is applied to the next round’s recovery.
**Welcoming the Uninvited Guest** (3m; Supplemental; Uniform)
The shadow finger can attack an enemy he’s unaware of as long as the stylist is aware of him and has beaten his Stealth, if applicable.
### Mastery
The stylist’s shadow fingers can pay the cost of these techniques instead of her.
### Terrestrial
This Charm’s minimum Essence increases to 4. Each of its techniques can only be used once per scene, unless reset when a shadow finger lands a decisive attack that resets his Initiative and builds back to Initiative 15+. This resets all used techniques.
