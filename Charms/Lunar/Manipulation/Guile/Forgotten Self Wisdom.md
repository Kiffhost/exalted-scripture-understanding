Assuming another’s identity, the Lunar casts aside a part of herself. Upon shapeshifting into a human or animal form, she suppresses an [[Intimacy]] incompatible with impersonating that shape. It can’t be detected by read intentions actions or similar effects, nor can it modify her [[Resolve]], justify persuade actions against her, or be called upon in Decision Points. The Lunar’s own behavior may still reveal the [[Intimacy]] to an observer. She can stack this Charm to suppress multiple [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. This Charm ends if the Lunar leaves the shape she used it in. If the Lunar ends it and uses the sealed [[Intimacy]] to bolster her [[Resolve]] or in a Decision Point in the same scene, she can’t use this Charm again for the rest of the day.
