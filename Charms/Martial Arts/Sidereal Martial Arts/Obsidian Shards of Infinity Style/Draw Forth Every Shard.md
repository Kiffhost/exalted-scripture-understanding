*Shatter what is and reveal all that could be.*
The stylist may pay a five-mote surcharge when she uses Shattered Self Duality to manifest countless reflections, forming a battle group of one. She gains the following benefits
- She gains Size (Essence/2, round up) and Magnitude (10 + Size). She doesn’t have Drill or Might and can still use Charms.
- She adds (Size) dice on attack rolls and withering damage rolls.
- She adds +(Size) soak.
- She can make both withering and decisive area attacks and engage gambits (Exalted, pp.
208-209). On withering attacks, only the highest damage roll awards Initiative. On decisive attacks, she divides her Initiative evenly among all hit enemies (rounding up) to determine the damage rolled against them. Area attacks are incompatible with Simple Charms.
- She has (10 + Size) Magnitude. This is separate from her health track, representing the destruction of her reflections. Each time she loses a dot of Size, she makes a (Wits + Martial Arts) roll at a difficulty equal to the rout check a normal battle group would face (Exalted, p. 209). On a failed roll, this Charm ends, and she suffers a level of unpreventable lethal damage.
- She can’t benefit from command actions or Charms that specifically enhance battle groups.
The stylist still waives Black Shards Fall Like Ice’s Willpower cost and doesn’t appear in mirrors, but she doesn’t gain any other benefits of Shattered Self Duality’s base effect.
This Charm isn’t compatible with other effects that grant battle group traits.
