*The Dragon-Blood’s elemental [[Essence]] overflows into her [[Templates/sorcery]].*
Whenever she shapes a spell based on a single element, such as [[Flight of the Brilliant Raptor]], [[Invulnerable Skin of Bronze]], or Wood Dragon’s Claw, she gains a single additional sorcerous mote each round she spends shaping it. If the Dragon-Blooded is in the Aura state that matches the spell’s element, she gains three sorcerous motes each round instead.
