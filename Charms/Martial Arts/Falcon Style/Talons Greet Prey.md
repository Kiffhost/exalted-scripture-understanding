*The stylist moves with unmatched grace to defend against a foe’s strike, letting its wasted momentum drive him into her clutches.*
She gains +1 Defense against an attack from close range. If it misses, she counterattacks with a grapple gambit. 1s on the enemy’s attack roll add non-Charm dice on her attack roll and the grapple control roll. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a grappled enemy with a decisive savage, slam, or throw, then rising to Initiative 12+. If the stylist immediately slams or throws her attacker upon winning clinch control, this Charm need not be reset.
