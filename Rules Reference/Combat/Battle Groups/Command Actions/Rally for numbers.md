Finally, a rally for numbers action can be taken after the [[Battle Group]] has suffered [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] damage, to stiffen the resolve of hesitating soldiers or to call warriors who have begun to break formation and flee back to battle. It is a ({Charisma or Appearance} + War) roll against difficulty 1. Every two successes rolled restore one point of Magnitude. Rallying for numbers can’t give a battle group more Magnitude than its current maximum rating, nor can it restore a lost point of [[Size]]—that can only be done by recruitment or rounding up deserters after the battle. A battle group can only benefit from one rally for numbers action per battle, though losing a point of Size resets this limit.
