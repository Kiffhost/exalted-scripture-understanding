*With a cavalier leap, the Exalt unhorses a rider and takes the reins.*
This Charm supplements an unhorse gambit. If the Lawgiver has higher [[Initiative]] than her target, it also lowers the difficulty of the gambit by 1. Upon success, the Solar leaps onto an enemy mount, knocking the rider from the saddle and taking the reins in one smooth motion. If the Exalt is on foot, this gambit only works from close range. However, if she is already mounted, her steed can throw her an extra range band, allowing her to attempt the gambit from short range. The range of [[Horse-Stealing Leap]] can also be enhanced by appropriate [[Athletics]] [[Charms]]. If the Exalt is trying to steal back her own horse, this Charm automatically succeeds.
