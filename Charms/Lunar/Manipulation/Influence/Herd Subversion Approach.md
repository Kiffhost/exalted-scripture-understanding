The Lunar invites transgression and disobedience, tempting others to forsake long-held traditions and mores. When she makes a persuade, bargain, or threaten roll to convince one or more characters to violate or act contrary to a culture’s custom, members of that culture suffer −1 Resolve. Such characters can’t use Ties to that culture to bolster their Resolve or spend Willpower in Decision Points.
