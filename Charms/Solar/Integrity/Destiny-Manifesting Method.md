The Solar is the heritor of a legend that cannot easily be erased. When struck with a reality-shaping or fate-weaving attack that would permanently alter her mind or body, the Solar’s destiny manifests to override the changes. This Charm does not completely nullify deleterious effects. Paying this Charm’s cost merely downgrades or slows the effect. Destiny-Manifesting Method guarantees two things: First, the Solar cannot be immediately changed beyond her ability to represent the character concept implied by the ten prerequisites from which she derived this Charm. Second, no matter how fatal or permanent the effect may be, fate itself will generate a condition by which the Solar may shatter any curse. This condition is decided by the Storyteller. The Storyteller should also provide the Solar ample time—seasons or even years—to pursue a cure. The Solar is not guaranteed to know the shattering condition of her curse, but characters with appropriate Lore, Medicine, and Occult Charms may be able to aid her in this regard.
