*As the Sidereal pledges herself to a quest, she tosses a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Eternal Maiden into the air to dart about at random, trailing vivid yellow afterimages.*
The Sidereal names a goal and binds herself to it, forsaking everything — even who she is — to reach it. This has the following effects: 
- She treats influence that opposes her goal as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). 
- She can’t be reduced below [[Initiative]] 1 by withering attacks, though they still award the full amount of [[Initiative]] damage rolled. 
- She adds ([[Stamina]]) [[Hardness]], stacking with other [[Hardness]] sources. 
- She heals a level of damage at the start of each turn. Outside of combat, she multiplies the rate at which she heals naturally by ([[Stamina]] x5). 
- She can’t take non-reflexive action that aren’t relevant to her goal. (She can still perform basic tasks that don’t require rolls). Actions that are only tangentially relevant suffer a −3 penalty. 
- She forsakes her name. It’s forgotten by everyone who knows it — including her — and erased wherever it may be written. This also applies to nicknames, sobriquets, and the similar appellations. 
- She adds ([[Stamina]]) to the difficulty of rolls opposing her arcane fate. It applies against characters who’re normally immune to it. Upon accomplishing her goal, the Sidereal rolls ([[Willpower]]) dice, gaining [[Willpower]] equal to her successes and [[Limit]] equal to her 10s. Her name is restored to the world and characters immune to arcane fate regain any suppressed memories. If the Sidereal ends this Charm before completing her goal or if her goal becomes impossible, she loses all [[Limit]]. All memories that anyone else has of her are erased. Her name becomes irrevocably lost, even to herself, and her arcane fate remains empowered as above. It’s possible to requisition a new identity from the Bureau of Heaven’s Department of Abstract matters, but this requires either lengthy bureaucratic procedures or convincing a politically prominent god to fast track her request. It may be possible to acquire a new identity by other means. The new identity lets the Sidereal take a new name and frees her of her empowered arcane fate, but doesn’t restore old memories of her — she’s not that person anymore.
