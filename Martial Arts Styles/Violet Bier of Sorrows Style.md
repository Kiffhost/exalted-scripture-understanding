# [[Violet Bier of Sorrows Style]]
Violet Bier of Sorrows is an ancient style, old as the First Age if not older. Some stories attribute its creation to a Sidereal inspired by the Maiden of Endings’ power and conviction; others say it arose from a prehistoric cult of Saturn, or one of the many legendary martial artists of the First Age, or Saturn herself. It emphasizes speed, exploiting enemies’ injuries, and powerful killing blows. Its students often cultivate detachment from emotion and compassion in battle, able to act infinitesimally faster than enemies because they do not feel the emotional experience of violence in the moment.
The Division of Endings has maintained the style’s lineage unbroken for millennia, but other schools can be found. In the Spindrift Archipelago, the [[Cult]] of Saturn Pharmacopeia practices a [[knife]]-focused variant of the style, often aiding and training peasant uprisings. Sijan’s Reverent Lodge of the Broken Sepulcher, a secret society and trade guild of morticians, studies the style as a philosophical and mystical discipline. The dueling academies of seven-bridged Padhia teach a bastardized offshoot, the so-called Silent Executioner style.
