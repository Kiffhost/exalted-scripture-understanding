*No mount should hope to outlive its rider. The lesser falls before the greater.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she takes decisive damage while mounted, after a damage roll, letting her negate up to (higher of Essence or 3) levels of damage at her mount’s expensive. For each level of damage negated, the mount suffers three levels. The Infernal can’t displace more damage than her mount has health levels to fill with this overflow. If this kills her mount, it erupts in emerald flame that leaves only smouldering viscera behind.

If the Infernal rides one of her bound demons, it takes only two levels of damage for each level she displaces.
