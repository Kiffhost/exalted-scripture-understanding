*The Abyssal’s form blurs and fades, eerily translucent and featureless when visible at all.*
The Abyssal adds (Essence) successes on Stealth rolls.
She doesn’t need a hiding place to roll Stealth for concealment.
Attacking or moving between range bands suppresses this Charm’s benefits until the end of the Abyssal’s next turn. This Charm ends if she’s hit by an attack.
