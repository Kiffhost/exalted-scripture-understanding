*Many die alone in the frozen battlefields of the distant North.*
Radiant Abal thought himself different when he set out against The Winter That Walks. Seiglinde of the Crimson Veil cautioned her young Solar against his quest, but he spurned her counsel and left in secret to hunt the behemoth. By the time Seiglind arrived, nothing remained of him save picked-over bones.
Fallen in battle, Abal’s ghost was claimed by a pack of scavenging walkuren, soul-reaping shades born from dreams of death. Seiglinde, enraged, tracked the scavengers to their nest and slaughtered them. As a final humiliation, she fashioned [[Scavenger’s Shroud]], flaying the walkuren’s skin for a coat and looting their ragpicker’s trove to adorn it with innumerable amulets, hunting trophies, ancient coins, and other trinkets. The soulsteel wires threaded through the Shroud came from this hoard as well, forged from the scraps of long-discarded souls.
Seiglinde’s ghost haunts her lonely cairn, where the Shroud lies buried with her. She has refused all who’ve sought it, save for her reincarnations or those of her Solar mate. Foxfang Beyza used [[Scavenger’s Shroud]] to purloin House Akiyo’s treasure-halls, bedeviling the young Scarlet [[Realm]] before falling to the [[Wyld Hunt]]. The sorcerer Zhanidar wore it when he stole the endless palace of Eidolon from a lord of chaos. Each time the Shroud’s wearer falls, Seiglinde’s ghost retrieves her creation and returns to her cairn to mourn. Rumor claims that the Shroud has been stolen, for some claim to have seen a dark wanderer clad in the morbid raiment, but Seiglinde denies any lapse in her guardianship. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the [[Scavenger’s Shroud]]

The [[Evocations]] of [[Scavenger’s Shroud]] express the nature and avarice of the walkuren it was made from, aiding in finding and stealing treasures.
Upon attuning [[Scavenger’s Shroud]], its bearer awakens [[Ragpicker’s Ken]] for free.
