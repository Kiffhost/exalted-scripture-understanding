With a quick eye and lightning movement, the Solar may reflexively hurl a Thrown-based decisive attack at an opponent who takes an aim action, without needing to aim herself. If her attack does at least one health level of damage, the aim action is interrupted. This Charm allows the Exalt to attack ahead of her actual turn, so long as she can perceive the aim action being readied. Using this Charm uses the Exalt’s combat action, and therefore cannot be used if the Exalt has already attacked on that round. Lastly, this Charm allows the Solar to use the prerequisite reflexively in combination with itself. At Thrown 5+ Essence 3+, the Solar may use this Charm without using her combat action once per round.

### On Thunder-Quelling Gesture

The Exalt needs to be aware of her target taking aim in order to use this Charm. This Charm does not confer knowledge of whether or not this is happening, so if it is not clearly apparent, the player should consider using Awareness Charms and the prerequisite, Angle-Tracing Edge. With Awareness Charms dedicated to hearing, the Solar could commit herself to listening for the nigh-inaudible pull of a bowstring, and with the appropriate Awareness roll (difficulty or Stealth contest determined by the Storyteller) she could pinpoint the exact position of an archer hiding out of sight, and bounce her missile off a wall or a parapet (via prerequisite) to strike her target and stop them from taking aim. Note that this Charm does not specify who the target is aiming at. Use this Charm to judiciously intercept the slings and arrows that will no doubt be hurled at your Solar’s friends and allies. This Charm was written in response to a backer’s desire to have some defense within the Thrown ability from formidable ranged attacks. It was structured as it is in order to meet that demand without violating the tactical limits of Thrown. Backer: Robert-Sean Harley
