*The Abyssal thespian has no identity but what she chooses to show her audience.*
The Abyssal can use [[Performance]] instead of [[Socialize]] when calculating [[Guile]]. She gains +1 non-Charm [[Guile]] while acting in a performance. Likewise, if she disguises herself, feigns death, or uses [[Wicked Stagecraft Expertise]], she gains this bonus against effects that would reveal the truth.
