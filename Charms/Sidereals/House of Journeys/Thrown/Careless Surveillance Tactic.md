The Sidereal’s foes can’t predict her attacks if she doesn’t know she’s making them. When an enemy comes within close range of the Sidereal, a weapon leaps from her hand unbidden, making a decisive attack against him. The target rolls (Perception + Wits) against her attack roll. If he fails, it becomes a surprise attack, inflicting −2 Defense. Against enemies of fate, the Sidereal can attack whenever they move a range band toward her — voluntarily or otherwise — as long as they end their movement within medium range. Reset: Once per scene unless reset by crashing an enemy or dealing decisive damage with Willful Weapon Method.
