*The Infernal shatters others’ perceptions of her, becoming something incomprehensible to their senses.*

The Infernal makes it impossible for anyone to discern her identity or any details of her appearance, including her iconic anima display. They can still see her, but can’t understand what they’re seeing. If she stunts an influence roll with a description of how she benefits from this, she adds (Stealth/2, rounded up) dice.

The Infernal isn’t immune to this Charm’s effect. If she has Ties to herself or other Intimacies based on how she sees herself, she must weaken one of them by one step at the end of a scene in which this Charm helps her achieve her goals.
