*With limitless speed and inexorable spirit, the Solar’s weapon flashes in an arc, striking opponents on all sides.*
This Charm allows the Solar to roll a single decisive attack against all opponents at close range, using half her current Initiative value (rounded up) as the base damage for every attack. Against minor opponents, use the Solar’s full [[Initiative]] for the base damage of each attack and ignore hardness. 
At [[Essence]] 5+, the cost of this Charm is reduced by one mote.
