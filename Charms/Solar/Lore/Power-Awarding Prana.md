*The Solar can uplift another Lawgiver, making him a vector for her power.*
With a touch, the Exalt grants the target a Solar Charm he qualifies for, even if the initiating Exalt does not know the Charm herself. If the initiating Solar has a higher [[Essence]] rating than her target, or has selected [[Lore]] as her Supernal Ability, the recipient may learn [[Charms]] at one [[Essence]] higher than his current rating. To use this Charm, the Solar commits five motes plus a number of motes equal to the experience points cost the target would have to pay to learn the Charm. The recipient pays the activation costs of such [[Charms]] from his own mote pools. At any time she wishes, the initiating Solar may end commitment to this effect, causing knowledge of the conferred Charm to fade from the recipient’s mind. [[Power-Awarding Prana]] can never be forcefully dispelled or prematurely ended by any sort of magic. At [[Essence]] 5+, the Solar can use this Charm on herself. If [[Lore]] is her Supernal Ability, waive this requirement. If the target is [[Essence]] 5 and beyond, [[Power-Awarding Prana]] does not allow the training of [[Charms]] at higher [[Essence]] ratings than the character’s current maximum. For example, an [[Essence]] 5 Solar cannot teach herself [[Essence]] 6 [[Charms]], but she can still confer [[Essence]] 5 [[Charms]] to an [[Essence]] 4 character. [[Sorcery]] cannot be granted with this Charm.
