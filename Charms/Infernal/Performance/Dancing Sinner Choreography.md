*The Infernal’s passionate performance inspires all who see her to join in frenzied dance.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Appearance or Charisma} + Performance) inspire roll through music, dance, or song against a single character, adding (Essence) non-Charm successes. Success overwhelms the target with a feverish urge to dance for the rest of the scene. He adds (higher Infernal’s Essence or 3) dice on dance-based Performance rolls he makes.

In combat, the affected character must spend each of his turns dancing, which can include making a Performance-based influence roll. He can still flurry, including actions that normally can’t be flurried, like using Simple Charms. His frenetic dance makes all his movement count as being in difficult terrain. Once the scene ends, he gives a Minor Principle expressing a desire to dance or engage in revelry.

Alternatively, the Infernal can target all trivial characters who can perceive her, waiving this Charm’s Willpower cost. She may choose to have them continue dancing for up to (Essence) hours after the scene ends.

This influence costs three Willpower and five Initiative to resist. It’s reduced by one Willpower each time an affected character rolls 5+ successes on a dance-based Performance roll. If he reduces it to zero, the Initiative cost is waived as well.
