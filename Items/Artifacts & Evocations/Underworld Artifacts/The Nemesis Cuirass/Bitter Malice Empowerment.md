*In battle against a hated foe, every blow must be honed and perfected by absolute malice.*
When the wearer attacks an enemy she has a negative Tie toward or takes another action capable of physically harming him, she rerolls ([[Intimacy]]) failed dice. This can also enhance rushes, threaten rolls, and [[Perception]] rolls against such characters.
Once the wielder uses this Evocation against a character, she can’t use it against other characters for the rest of the scene unless her original target is incapacitated.
## Resonant
The wearer isn’t limited to using this Evocation against one enemy at a time.
