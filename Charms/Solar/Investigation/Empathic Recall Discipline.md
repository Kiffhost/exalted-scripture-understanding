*By piecing together the evidence of a crime scene, the Exalt can channel the perpetrator’s perspective.*
This Charm may be used after a case scene action. The Lawgiver congeals what she has seen into a moment of clear understanding of the perpetrator. This is treated as a ([[Wits]] + [[Investigation]]) based read intentions action with a difficulty of the perpetrator’s [[Larceny]]. On a success, the Solar understands the meaning behind the event—that is, what the perpetrator intended by the crime. Even if the roll fails, the Exalt is able to adapt the perpetrator’s perspective automatically upon using [[Unknown Wisdom Epiphany]].
