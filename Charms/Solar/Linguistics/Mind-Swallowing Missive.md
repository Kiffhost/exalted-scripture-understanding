The Solar unwinds language with her Essence, writing in such a way that it unbinds the pattern of her reader’s understanding. This Charm supplements a letter written to a specific target, the Solar rolling (Manipulation + Linguistics) to determine its accuracy. If her target reads the letter, he must roll his (Perception + Linguistics) to defend against a swarm of unbinding words that penetrates his mind where languages live. If he fails, his knowledge of all languages is unbound, causing him to forget every language he’s currently able to speak. In addition, the subject develops a completely new language on the spot. This language is both functional and logical—and has letters and grammar mechanics—but it is known only to the Charm’s victim. An Exalt may break this control by paying (Solar’s Essence rating) Willpower, instantly recovering one of his spoken languages and another every hour until his knowledge has been restored. Otherwise, this effect lasts until the Solar lifts the commitment. When Mind-Swallowing Missive is broken, the subject’s new language vanishes from his memory. This Charm does not affect spirits.
