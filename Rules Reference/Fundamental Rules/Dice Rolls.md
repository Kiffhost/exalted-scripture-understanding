Exalted uses a d10s successes system. Whenever a character attempts something that they might fail at, they make a dice roll, rolling a number of d10s equal to their [[#Dice Pool]]. If there are more [[#Successes]] than the [[#Target Number]], then the roll (and the attempt) *succeeds*, if not then it *fails*, rarely resulting in [[#Botch]].

## Dice Pool

The number of d10s to be rolled, usually equal to an Attribute + Ability. This number is often modified by [[#Modifiers]] from things like charms, environmental conditions and [[Health Track|wounds]].

## Successes

Each dice which rolls above the target number counts as one success. 
### Doubling
Sometimes particular values count as two successes. This is called "doubling Xs" where x is the number which is doubled. For example, most actions requiring a roll count rolls of 10 as two successes, so we can say most rolls *Double 10s*.
### Threshold Successes
When a roll succeeds, 

## Non-Successes

Dice rolls which are below the [[#Target Number]], and so are not successes.

## Difficulty

The number of successes required for the roll to succeed. Typically from 1 to 5.

## Target Number

The number above which dice count as a success. Usually 6, can be modified by charms (especially Sidereal charms).

## Botch

A roll in which no successes were achieved, and at least one dice shows a 1. Botches are considered catastrophic moments which complicate the objective for the player characters.

## Modifiers

Positive = bonus, negative = penalty. Any change to the usual dice pool for a roll, used to represent some external or unusual factor influencing the character, such as *Charms*, *equipment*, or *situation*. Situational penalties are usually applied when the difficulty is already pre-set, or in the case of opposed rolls.

## Re-rolls
???

## Opposed roll

When resolving an [[Action#Opposed|opposed action]] two players each roll at the same time, where the [[#Difficulty]] for each roll is equal to the other player's number of [[#Successes]].
