*The [[Rain of Doom]] can be called down only as the setting sun touches the horizon, as the sorcerer stands at the boundaries of what she’d consign to destruction.*
The sky darkens at an unnatural pace, with thick, oily clouds that roil with thunder forming over an area the size of a small city (or a major district of a metropolis such as Nexus). The storm gathers for an hour, building in intensity, until it finally climaxes in a downpour of apocalyptic devastation that lasts until sunrise. The spell can be countered by any opposing sorcerer within the affected area during the one hour period in which it takes form, assuming a sorcerer can recognize the signs of an oncoming [[Rain of Doom]]. 
The [[Rain of Doom]] has the following effects: 
- Caustic rain falls, a difficulty 4 environmental hazard that deals one die of aggravated lethal damage per round to anyone beneath the open sky. Even after a character has found shelter, he continue suffering from the corrosive rain at a reduced difficulty of 2 until he’s stripped off all clothing and armor worn in the downpour. Most mortals and animals die within seconds of exposure, and the Storyteller need not roll dice for each individual victim. 
- The [[Rain of Doom]] wreaks mass destruction on any structures or objects caught in its downpour. Any mundane object left unattended in the rain is destroyed. Wooden structures may be dissolved entirely by the downpour, while even stone and metal are damaged, their faces burned and pitted. Only manses, magically reinforced structures, or deep subterranean buildings are safe from this desolation. If it becomes dramatically relevant to see if a structure will remain intact to provide shelter to characters, the Storyteller can make a roll of five dice at intervals of an hour. One success is sufficient to damage structures made of wood or any weaker material, three successes will damage structures made of stone, and five successes will damage those made of metal. It takes two intervals of damage to destroy a house-sized structure, and five to collapse a mighty palace—prior to total collapse, the structure may begin to partially dissolve, creating openings in the roof and walls through which the rain might enter to menace those within. 
- Any character bold or insane enough to try and fight while exposed to the storm must contend not only with the corrosive rain, but with harsh winds that impose a -3 penalty on all actions he takes. In addition, at the end of each round that a character spends under the open sky, the Storyteller rolls one die. On a 1, that character is struck by a lightning bolt, and takes ten dice of lethal damage which ignores [[Hardness]]. 
The runoff from the [[Rain of Doom]] remains potent until neutralized by the touch of daylight, causing any character who comes into contact with the runoff to roll against the environmental hazard of the rain. Even after sunrise, the rain’s poison guarantees that nothing but stunted scrub will grow on the land washed by the storm’s runoff for years or even decades to come. 
## Control Spell
A sorcerer who knows [[Rain of Doom]] as her control spell may move the storm through the sky at a rate of ([[Essence]] x 3) miles in an hour. She is often followed by dark clouds and natural light becomes gray in her presence, making others feel uneasy. When outdoors, she takes a -2 penalty on all social influence actions other than threaten. 
## Distortion
(Goal Number: 20)
Distorting the [[Rain of Doom]] creates a break in the storm’s downpour surrounding the sorcerer, large enough to shelter a single structure or a large group of people. Within this break, no acidic rain falls and lightning will not strike, although the mundane effects of the storm’s winds still remain in force.
