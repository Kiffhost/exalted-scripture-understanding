The Infernals’ simplest powers are their Excellencies. When an Infernal makes an (Attribute + Ability) roll, she may add dice to it for one mote each with that Ability’s Excellency. She may also use Excellencies to raise her static values — [[Defense|Evasion]], [[Defense|Parry]], [[Resolve]], and [[Guile]] — paying two motes for each +1 bonus.

Gaining Excellencies: An Infernal automatically gains the Excellency of any of her Caste or Favoured Abilities she has at least one dot in, as well as any other Abilities she knows at least one Charm from.

## Dice Limit
Infernals can’t add more than (Attribute + Ability) dice from Excellencies or other magic to a roll, or more than ((Attribute + Ability) / 2, rounded down) to a static value.
