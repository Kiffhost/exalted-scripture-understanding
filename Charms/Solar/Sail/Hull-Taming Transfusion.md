*In a desperate effort, the Solar conjoins her [[Essence]] to that of the shipâ€™s, trading life for life.*
By paying two motes at the moment of impact, the Solar opens a channel between body and hull, transferring damage from ship to self at a rate of three health levels per one level of hull damage ablated.
