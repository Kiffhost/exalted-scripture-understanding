*It is not in the Infernal’s nature to accept failure, no matter how inevitable it might be.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after a Medicine roll to reroll all dice that showed failures. On a successful roll, she gains one Willpower if she has a positive Major or Defining Tie for her patient or a Major or Defining Intimacy based on positive feelings for the doomed or the dying. She also gains one Willpower if she fails a roll to treat a grievous ailment.
