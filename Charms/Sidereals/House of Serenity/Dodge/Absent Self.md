Foreseeing her enemy’s attacks, the Sidereal arranges to be elsewhere when they land. The Sidereal ignores (higher of Essence or 3) points of Evasion penalty. This can’t negate penalties from surprise attacks. If she’s unarmored or suffers no Evasion penalties, she can dodge an attack whose successes equal her Evasion.
