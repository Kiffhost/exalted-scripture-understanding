*The Sidereal knows the scent of fear.*
The Sidereal makes a special ([[Perception]] + Battles Ability) read intentions roll. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
- Is he afraid of me? 
- How could I best intimidate him? 
- Who here is he most afraid of? 
- What would he face his fears for? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if [[introducing a fact]].
