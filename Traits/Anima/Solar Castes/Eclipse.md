Few events in Creation are rarer or more portentous than a solar eclipse. The sun, the moon, and the stars share the sky, united in a grand display of celestial harmony. It is the duty of the Eclipse Caste to bring such harmony to the rest of Creation. As diplomats, they travel to the far reaches of the world—and beyond—braving the wilds and treating with strange peoples. The treaties they forge help bind the world together, encouraging the exchange of both riches and ideas. As ministers, they run cartels and nations with skill and aplomb, expanding their interests far and wide. As explorers, they seek out new opportunities for themselves, their Circlemates, and Creation. Regardless of his surroundings, an Eclipse is confident, versatile, and eager to rise to any challenge.

The Eclipses of the First Age kept the enormous Old Realm running at peak efficiency, ensuring that its bureaucracies were swift and fair. They traveled the length and breadth of Creation as goodwill ambassadors, fostering understanding between disparate peoples. Their journeys took them into the dream-courts of the Fair Folk, the silent halls of the dead, and even the maddened streets of Hell. They forged alliances between spirits and men, bonds of trust and mutual profit. In the face of Dragon-Blooded treachery, the Eclipses turned to their allies for shelter and protection, but the usurpers’ influence reached far and wide; faced with betrayal at every turn, the Eclipses fought for their lives, and lost. 

Harmony and understanding are rarities in the Age of Sorrows. The Crowned Suns have returned to a world wracked by centuries of strife, where treachery and duplicity are commonplace. Undaunted, they have begun to rebuild what was lost, ending wars and forging alliances. They broker agreements between gods and men, pacify faeries with ancient stories, and even act as ambassadors for the living in the land of the dead. All the while, the Eclipses seek out remnants of the First Age—living or otherwise—to integrate into the framework of society. Lost peoples and ancient wonders hide in the wilds of Creation, and the Eclipses are eager to find them. 

Eclipses are people-savvy—they might be the sort who make friends everywhere they go, or they might simply be keen students of the human condition. A wizened society matron is as likely to become an Eclipse as a welltraveled merchant or a cunning diplomat. Eclipses are often the public face of their Circle, negotiating on its behalf and representing its interests. Their adaptability and knowledge of the world makes them an invaluable asset, whether the Circle is acclimating to the mannerisms of a foreign court or trekking through the jungle in search of a First Age ruin.

# Anima Banner

The Eclipse Caste Mark is a disk within a circle, both of brilliant gold. Their animas resemble the corona of the sun during an eclipse—brilliant whites and golds, sparkling at the core and growing filmy and diaphanous at the edges. 

# Anima Effects

During an eclipse, the Unconquered Sun stands surrounded by all the splendor of Heaven—he and the world join together to create the mightiest of omens. The Eclipse Caste is likewise given sanction to command the glory of the world, and to bind it together in the cause of righteousness. See page 176 for details. 

- For 10 motes, one Willpower, the Eclipse sanctifies an oath she has witnessed. The Exalt touches the oathgivers (or their words, as they pass through the air), her caste mark flashing imperceptibly. If she wishes, her anima briefly flares, swirling with the words and runes by which Heaven has given her the right to arbitrate such matters. 
	Oath-givers who break pacts sanctified by the Eclipse (including the Exalt herself ) are subject to a terrible curse. The details of the curse are devised by the Storyteller, ideally reflecting the oath broken. A woman who breaks a hospitality oath might find herself incapable of rest beneath any roof for a year and a day, while a man who murdered the one he swore to protect may find his defenses utterly failing him when he must next fight for his life. 
- The Eclipse has diplomatic immunity when treating with the enemies of Creation. So long as the Eclipse approaches them on legitimate business of some kind, shades, spirits, the demon princes of Hell, and the Fair Folk may not attack the Eclipse or her companions without just cause, and such creatures must observe the local rules of hospitality. Such beings may still attempt to provoke members of the Solar’s embassy into breaking the peace, thus voiding this effect’s protection.
- The Eclipse represents all the subtle movements of Essence under Heaven, the strange and self-referencing powers that stir when night merges with day. Eclipses can learn the Charms of spirits, Fair Folk and similar supernatural beings which have the Eclipse keyword for eight experience points each.
