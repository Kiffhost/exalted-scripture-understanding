*The stylist executes a brutal aerial attack, plummeting down onto a foe to strike with stunning force.*
She makes a decisive attack against a prone enemy, or an enemy one range band vertically beneath her. If the latter, she leaps downward to strike, which counts as her movement action that round. She adds (higher of [[Athletics]] or [[Strength]]) attack roll extra successes as dice of damage. For each 10 on the damage roll, the enemy loses 1 [[Initiative]] (which she doesn’t gain). This leaves the stylist prone, although she suffers no penalties; however, she can’t use this Charm again until she’s risen. 
## Mastery
This doesn’t count as the stylist’s movement action.
