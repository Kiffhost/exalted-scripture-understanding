At one with the wilderness that surrounds them, horse and rider move with matchless grace. They may gallop through undergrowth, weave between trees in a dense forest, or trample over brambles. The Dragon-Blood ignores plant-based environmental penalties to her mounted movement actions. Any environmental penalties on her Ride rolls due to plants or vegetation-covered terrain are lowered by two points. With Essence 2, the Dragon-Blood may learn elemental variants of this Charm for three experience points each. These variants are Stackable with each other. Air: This variant negates penalties from wind and foul weather. Earth: This variant negates penalties for moving over uneven earth or rocky terrain. Water:Thisvariantnegatespenaltiesformovingwhilepartially immersed in water, or over a wet or slippery surface.
