The Dragon-Blood has cultivated an affinity for Creation’s elementals, those spirits closest in nature to her own [[Essence]]. She may take elementals with [[Essence]] 3 or less as familiars, up to a maximum of (her [[Essence]]) such familiars. She may claim as her familiars elementals that she has sorcerously summoned — sustaining their existence indefinitely beyond the spell’s end — but not those currently bound by others.
The Dragon-Blood may use [[Beast-Taming Aspect]] and [[Animal Empathy Technique]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 271) to enhance influence rolls against elementals with [[Essence]] 3 or less as though they were animals. Such uses of those [[Charms]] have the same aspect as the elemental targeted.
