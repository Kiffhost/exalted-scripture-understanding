*The necromancer shapes a singing sphere of ivory Essence in hand and hurls it down to shatter at her feet, unleashing a wave of shrieking light to cleave flesh from bone.*
The necromancer unleashes a wave of Essence, rolling (Perception + Occult) as an unblockable decisive attack against all living characters — including allies — within short range. This ignores cover. The attack deals (Intelligence + extra successes) dice of lethal damage to each hit character or (Intelligence + Essence + extra successes) against mortals. Corpses within range are stripped of any trace of flesh, leaving only clean bone behind.
Damaged characters suffer an additional die of lethal damage at the start of each of their turns as their flesh falls away. This ignores Hardness. This effect ends if a roll doesn’t deal any damage.
## Control
The living suffer even greater agony as their flesh is ripped free, increasing their wound penalty by −1 for as long as they suffer this spell’s effects. The necromancer may call forth a sphere of ivory light whose eerie radiance makes skin crawl and flesh twitch.
