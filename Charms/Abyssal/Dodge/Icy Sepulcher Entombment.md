*The Abyssal’s enemies are already prisoners to their own despair; all that is necessary is to demonstrate this truth.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Frozen Fears Blossom]] against an enemy with a Major or Defining Principle instilled by [[Gracious Gift of Despair]] or a similar [[Intimacy]], she may pay a one-mote, one-[[Initiative]] surcharge to imprison him in ice. If he’s damaged by the counterattack, he’s encased in rime, inflicting a −3 penalty on physical rolls and preventing him from taking movement actions. This penalty subtracts successes instead of dice on rolls to attack the Abyssal or to oppose her disengage rolls.
Breaking the enemy out of the ice requires a [[Strength]] 3 feat with difficulty ([[Intimacy]] + 2). Alternatively, he can be freed by magical fire or heat, but only if it deals 1+ decisive damage to him.
