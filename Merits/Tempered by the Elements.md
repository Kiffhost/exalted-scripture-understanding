Due to her upbringing, the character is at home navigating a certain harsh environment, selected when this Merit is taken. The character is able to cross one type of difficult terrain (such as deep snow, thick jungle, or broken ruins) at normal speed. While this Merit can be taken more than once, very few characters ever do so, as it takes years of intimate familiarity to cultivateâ€”a mere few months spent in a swamp or on the tundra is inadequate to foster such skill.
