The Exalt reaches into the core of her being, tapping a primal harmony of [[Essence]] that makes her nearly impossible to resist. Before taking a social influence action, roll the Exalt’s [[Willpower]], rerolling non-successes once. Remaining non-successes determine the Charm’s activation cost in [[Willpower]] points. Successes act as non-Charm successes on the Exalt’s next social influence attempt. In addition, if this influence is successful, the affected character must pay three [[Willpower]] on (Solar’s [[Essence]]) different days before he can overcome the influence, and may only do so if confronted with how his actions might be damaging to his Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]].
