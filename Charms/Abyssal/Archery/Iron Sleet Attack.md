*The Abyssal’s arrow radiates unearthly cold, freezing her victim’s lifeblood from within.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after rolling 3+ successes on a decisive damage roll. She can forgo one level of damage to prevent her target from taking his movement action this round — or next round, if he’s already taken one. Alternatively, against an enemy who’s successfully rushed or disengaged from the deathknight, she can deny him that action’s benefit, letting her move without provoking his reflexive movement.
