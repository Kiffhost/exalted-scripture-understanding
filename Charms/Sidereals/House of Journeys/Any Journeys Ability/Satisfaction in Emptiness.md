The Sidereal finds peace in letting go, accepting the impermanence of the world she’s sworn to serve. When a character makes an inspire roll or instill roll against the Sidereal to create or strengthen emotion-based Intimacies, he must roll twice, taking the lower result. The doesn’t apply to rolls based on emotions of simple happiness and joy in living. The Sidereal can enhance this Charm by abandoning an artifact or something the Storyteller deems equally meaningful and significant to the Sidereal — casting it into the ocean, leaving it unattended in a place teeming with thieves, gifting it to a Storyteller character, etc. If she does, she reduces the cost to resist affected influence rolls by one Willpower. If she subsequently encounters whatever she abandoned, this Charm ends.
