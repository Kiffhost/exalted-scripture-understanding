*The necromancer draws forth the shadow of death that exists in all living things, transforming her foe into a foreshadowing of his own corpse.*
The necromancer rolls ({Intelligence or Manipulation} + Occult) against the Resolve of a living character within medium range. Success transforms his appearance into an illusion of his own corpse, with the necromancer choosing the means of his apparent death — withered by age, covered in stab wounds, marked by deadly poxes, and so on. Other characters perceive him as being one of the undead, reacting to him accordingly, and he becomes Hideous (Exalted, p. 162). Characters with a relevant Intimacy or with reason to doubt the illusion can see through it with a difficulty 5 (Perception + {Awareness, Investigation, or Occult}) roll.
When the victim has the opportunity to look upon his hideous reflection, the necromancer’s player rolls (Manipulation + Occult) against his Resolve. This can’t be enhanced with Charms or other effects. She doubles 9s if it would be especially easy for her victim to see his reflection, like in a manse of mirror-polished marble or on the shore of a glassy lake. Success leaves him transfixed by his own grim visage until he spends one Willpower to resist. In combat, he must take a miscellaneous action each round to observe his reflection.
Once he’s spent (necromancer’s Essence, maximum 3) Willpower this way, he’s freed from this fixation, though the illusion remains.
Against mortals, the transformation is permanent, though the necromancer may proclaim a circumstance under which it breaks: when her victim slays one of her foes, swears his fealty to her, stands atop Mount Namas, etc.
This spell can also be cast on ghosts to shape their corpus, changing the apparent cause of their death and similar cosmetic supernatural features. These transformations are permanent if the ghost is willing or has Essence 1.
## Control
The necromancer may cast this spell on herself to change her apparent age, add cosmetic wounds and afflictions, or conceal their nature as one of the dead — or alternatively, as one of the living. If used for disguise, the necromancer adds (Occult) dice. This transformation lasts until she chooses to end it.
## Distortion (9)
While the victim still appears to be undead, he’s not forced to be Hideous and can see his reflection without incident. This lasts one scene.
