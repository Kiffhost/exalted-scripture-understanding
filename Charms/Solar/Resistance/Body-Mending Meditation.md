Even when unconscious, the Solar’s body and Essence work in unison to knit wounds and mend broken bones. Roll the Solar’s (Stamina + Resistance) to speed her natural healing by a factor of (Essence x successes). Alternately, successes on this roll can be added directly to the successes of Wound-Mending Care Technique on page 342. The Solar must spend an hour at rest for this power to take effect, but the boosted healing lasts for one day, so long as the Solar remains at rest.
