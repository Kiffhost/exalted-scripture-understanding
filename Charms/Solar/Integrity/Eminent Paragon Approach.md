Once per story, the Solar may supplement any action to uphold, defend, or act upon a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] with this Charm. 
If the action is successful, all who witness it become automatically aware of the Exaltâ€™s [[Intimacy|Principle]] and its intensity, as if they had succeeded at a read intentions action.
