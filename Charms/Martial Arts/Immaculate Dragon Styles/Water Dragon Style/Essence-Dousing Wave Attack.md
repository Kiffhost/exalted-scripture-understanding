*Striking with the dark, smothering [[Essence]] of a crashing wave, the martial artist quenches the flame of her foe’s battle prowess.*
If her decisive attack against a crashed enemy deals at least (his [[Essence]]) damage, she chooses one of his ongoing [[Charms]] to deactivate, which must belong to a combat Ability or be a combat-based physical Attribute Charm. The Storyteller should inform her player what applicable [[Charms]] her victim has active before she chooses. 
The martial artist may expend her Water Aura to use this Charm against an enemy who isn’t crashed.
