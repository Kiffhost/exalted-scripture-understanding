The Solar hones her medical abilities to an unearthly degree. By examining a patient closely and hearing about his symptoms, the Exalt can flawlessly diagnose his illness. This Charm supplements a (Perception + Medicine) attempt to generate a formal diagnosis, preventing the Solar from making any error in her analysis. Note that this Charm does not provide the Exalt with a vast storehouse of medical knowledge, but is based on her Lore and Medicine ratings. If the character encounters an unfamiliar disease, she is able to determine its general type and whether it is magical in nature. Though she may not always know exactly what she is looking at, this Charm guarantees she will never misdiagnose a patient. Lastly, if she encounters a disease which she specializes in treating, or which she has flawlessly diagnosed more than five times in a season, then she gains one mote each time she diagnoses it through the use of this Charm.
