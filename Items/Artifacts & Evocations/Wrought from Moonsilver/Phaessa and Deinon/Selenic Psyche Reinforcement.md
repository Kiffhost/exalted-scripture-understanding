Communing with the moon gods within the swords, the Lunar draws upon their strength of will. She adds +1 non-Charm Resolve or Guile. This Evocation can only be used once per day. Using it to increase Resolve while the swords are waxing or increase Guile while they’re waning doesn’t require a reset. 

## Resonant

A wielder who’s awakened this Evocation may, by meditating, communicate with the swords’ moon gods. They may also manifest in her dreams as she sleeps. Their knowledge is restricted to the wielder’s own, the experiences of previous wielders, and their time in Luna’s spirit court, largely limiting their advice to possible approaches to take. Phaessa is fierce, determined, and disdainful of obstacles. Deinon is subtle, patient, and favors attacking problems from unexpected angles.
