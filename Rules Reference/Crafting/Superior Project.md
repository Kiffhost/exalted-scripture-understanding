Superior projects describe two sorts of endeavor: [[Artifact|Artifacts]] ([[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Generic [[Artifact]] Weapons/Daiklave]]s and magical armour) and largescale construction (palaces and warships). Mortals may perform Superior Projects to the purpose of largescale construction, but not artifacts.
# Beginning
Creating artifacts requires the crafter be a character capable of manipulating [[Essence]] (such as an Exalt or sorcerer), have at least [[Lore]] 3, [[Occult]] 3, a relevant [[Craft]] Ability rated to at least 4, and must then purchase dots of [[Craft]] (Artifacts). In addition, all artifacts require high-quality tools and significant amounts of the magical materials; most also demand various exotic or mystical reagents such as frozen flame, behemoth bones, the captured love of a raksha noble, or other such wonders. Designing and building an artifact is a massive drain on a crafter, and as such these superior projects require a superior crafting [[#Slot]]. 
# Slot
Creating a superior slot requires that the character temporarily fuse together a number of [[Major Project#Slot]]s equal to the rating of the [[Artifact]] she wishes to create, and spend a number of [[Crafting Projects#Crafting Experience|gold points]] equal to the artifact’s rating. 
<details><summary>Example</summary>If Shen wanted to design an [[Artifact]] ••• daiklave, he would need to fuse three major slots and spend 3 gold experience points in order to create a superior slot capable of sustaining the project. If the character lacks sufficient major slots, she can temporarily create new major slots for 5 silver points each, as with starting a major project. </details>

Created superior slots vanish when the superior project they’re sustaining ends. Large construction projects are treated as 2 or 3-dot artifacts at the Storyteller’s discretion. 
# Finishing
Creating artifacts is an intensely demanding art, part craftsmanship, part spiritual communion. The character not only labors through the work-intensive task of shaping and tempering the magical materials, she also coaxes the artifact’s spirit into being and forges its [[Essence]] to suit her vision. As such, artifacts require a minimum time spent laboring over their construction before a character can attempt to finish them. 

| [[Artifact]] Dots | Minimum time | Goal number | [[Crafting Projects#Crafting Experience\|wxp]] |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 2             | 6 weeks      | 30          | 3                                              |
| 3             | 3 months     | 50          | 5                                              |
| 4             | 1 year       | 75          | 7                                              |
| 5             | 2 years      | 100         | 9                                              |

These times assume the character is spending several hours each day actively working on the artifact. In practice, it often takes much longer than the minimum allotted time to complete an artifact. 

Once the character is ready to try to finish the project, she must spend 10 [[Crafting Projects|gold points]] and roll Attribute + (Lower of [[Craft]] ([[Artifact]]) or the highest-rated most appropriate mundane [[Craft]] skill she possesses). Unlike [[Basic Project|basic]] and [[Major Project|major projects]], finishing a superior project is an [[Action#Extended|extended roll]]. This roll is difficulty 5, has a [[Action#Extended#Terminus|terminus]] of 6, and a goal number depending on the [[#^effebd|artifact's rating]]. The roll has no set [[Action#Extended#Interval|interval]]; each time the character pays 10 gold points to attempt to complete the project, she can roll once, and may attempt her next roll once she can pay another 10 gold points to try again. A botch immediately ruins the project, while failure to complete the artifact before the terminus means that the artifact’s spirit has failed to kindle, its [[Essence]] has not aligned, and that the artifact cannot be created—the character must scrap the project and start over. If the intended artifact was one-of-a-kind, such as all daiklaves and similar weapons are, the character can never attempt to build that specific artifact again. She might one day create a different daiklave, but the dream she strove to realize with that particular failed project is gone forever.
# Reward
Successfully completing a superior project in such a way that the character triggers at least one basic objective automatically grants the character a number of [[Crafting Projects#Crafting Experience|white experience points]] based on the [[#^effebd|artifact's rating]]. Additionally, for every unused interval remaining in the project, the character gains (Artifact’s rating x 2) gold points. Thus, if a character successfully made an [[Artifact]] ••• suit of jade armor in only three rolls, she would gain 5 white points and 18 gold points. 

Unlike basic and major projects, the character doesn’t gain any additional rewards for triggering multiple basic objectives.
