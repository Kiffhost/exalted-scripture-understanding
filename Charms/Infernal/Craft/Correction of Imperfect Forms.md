*The Infernal makes whole what has been twisted and shattered, restoring the order of the Yozis to a broken world.*

The Infernal needs only the slightest remnant of something to repair it (Exalted, p. 242), allowing her to accomplish impossible feats like reconstructing forbidden texts from ashes, rebuilding a teahouse that’s been burnt to cinders, or similar feats. These repairs may improve on superficial flaws in the original, leaving the reconstructed object more symmetrical in design.

Alternatively, if an object has been altered by exposure to the Wyld or other environmental Shaping effects, the Infernal can restore it to normalcy with a repair project.
