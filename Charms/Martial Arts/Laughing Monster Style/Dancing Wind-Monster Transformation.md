Locking together a million fingers in a squirming net of self-defeat, the stylist fades from existence, leaving only the sound of her mocking laughter and the enraged bellows of her foes. When she uses Laughing Monster Form, she may pay a seven-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to dematerialize, diffusing into a cloud of madness. Allies within short range gain Laughing Monster Form’s benefits, and the stylist can use Reflexive and Supplemental Laughing Monster Charms to benefit their attacks or dodges. The stylist can attack dematerialized characters within short range. She can also attack materialized characters afflicted by Unitary Being Forge within short range. She can use Shuffling the Pieces to snatch imps from enemies within short range and can discharge them through the attacks of allies within short range. However, enemies capable of striking the dematerialized can attack her as though she were one range band closer to them, rending her cloud-body. The stylist rematerializes, ending this Charm’s benefits, if there are no nontrivial enemies within short range when her turn ends. To dematerialize again, she must reuse Laughing Monster Form. 
## Terrestrial

The stylist remains vulnerable to materialized enemies’ attacks, but gains +2 Evasion against them if not enhanced by magic capable of striking the dematerialized. Swaying Grass Dance Style This style’s strikes and motions resemble dancing more than a martial art, hearkening back to its origins in slave uprisings. Disguising their training as dances and religious celebrations, the legendary Swaying Grass Dancers of old honed their art to overthrow their captors. The style is swift and unpredictable, employing feints and misdirection to force enemies off their rhythm. Dance-like footwork is key, used to maneuver around foes, evade attacks, and set up devastating kicks. Some dancers embrace the style purely as a fighting art, while others honor its history by covertly spreading it to slaves and the oppressed, fomenting rebellions and upheaval. Swaying Grass Dance Weapons: This style’s unarmed attacks are primarily kicks and knee strikes, though it also employs punches, elbow strikes, and headbutts. It also uses batons, iron boots, and knives. Unarmed attacks enhanced by this style’s Charms can be stunted to deal lethal damage. Armor: This style is incompatible with armor. Complementary Abilities: Performance is central to Swaying Grass Dance, while Dodge is used to outmaneuver foes.
