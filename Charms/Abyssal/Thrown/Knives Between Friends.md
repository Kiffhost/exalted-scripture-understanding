*Striking unseen from unexpected angles, the Abyssal sows suspicion and paranoia.*
The Abyssal misdirects her foes with an attack, requiring them to roll (Wits + Awareness) at difficulty (Essence + 10s on attack roll). 1s on their opposed rolls subtract successes. A character who fails their roll believes the attack came from a completely different angle or direction, rather than from the deathknight.
With Thrown 5, Essence 3, if the Abyssal uses this Charm while concealed, she doesn’t lose her concealment against enemies who failed their rolls.
