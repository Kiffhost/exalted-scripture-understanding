*The Sidereal has no time for the foolish remarks of the ignorant and unlettered, waving away arguments beneath her notice.*
The Sidereal may cite a [[Lore]] background in a Decision Point as though it were a Major [[Intimacy]]. If it relates a Defining [[Intimacy]], it counts as Defining itself. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by gaining a new [[Lore]] background (typically by purchasing a [[Lore]] specialty).
