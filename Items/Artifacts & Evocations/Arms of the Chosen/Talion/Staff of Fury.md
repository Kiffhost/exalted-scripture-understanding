However much righteous rage Talion’s wielder may expend, she inevitably finds cause to gather more. Talion gains a pool of Willpower, capped at the wielder’s (Essence), that the Exalt can spend as though it were her own to oppose the offender and his minions. Once per scene, when the Exalt is further wronged by the offender, or she witnesses or learns of a new wrong that the offender has dealt to another, Talion gains one Willpower. Concluding or abandoning a grievance empties Talion’s Willpower pool. ALLOCATION OF GRIEVANCES Whenever the text refers to wrongs committed by the offender, this includes actions performed by others at the offender’s behest, or by those in his employ with his tacit approval.

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with orichalcum, this Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder takes up a grievance that appeals to one of her Defining Intimacies — a Tie of compassion for the victim, a Tie of hatred for the offender, or a Principle whose moral code was violated by the offense would all qualify.
