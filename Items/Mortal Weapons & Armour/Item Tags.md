# [[Melee]] Weapon Tags
## Balanced
The power and leverage provided by this weapon give it an Overwhelming one point higher than normal. For example, a Balanced mundane medium weapon would have an Overwhelming value of 2. This tag is normally found on swords. 
## Bashing
This weapon normally does bashing damage when used to deliver a decisive attack. [[Brawl]]: Attacks with this weapon normally use [[Brawl]]. 
## Chopping
This weapon is capable of making chopping attacks. A chopping attack costs one point of [[Defense]] until the attacker’s next turn, as well as one point of [[Initiative]], but raises a withering attack’s raw damage by 3, or allows a decisive attack to treat [[Hardness]] as two points lower than its true value. This tag is primarily found on weapons with heavy blades, such as axes and chopping swords. 
## Disarming
This weapon reduces the difficulty and cost of disarm gambits by 1. 
## Flexible
This weapon ignores the [[Defense]] bonus granted by full defense actions. 
## Improvised 
Useable with both [[Brawl]] and [[Melee]], these simple weapons can be created out of anything sturdy, heavy and roughly well balanced. Because they are not designed for use as weapons, improvised weapons cost 1 [[Initiative]] to use in an attack. 
## [[Grappling]]
This weapon can be used to make grappling gambits. 
## Lethal
This weapon normally does lethal damage when used to deliver a decisive attack. Lethal close combat weapons can deliver bashing damage with an appropriate stunt, by e.g. attacking with the pommel or with the flat of the blade. 
## [[Martial Arts]]
Attacks with this weapon don’t use [[Melee]] or [[Brawl]]. Wielding it requires an applicable [[Martial Arts]] Ability. For example, the hook sword requires facility with a style like [[Martial Arts]] ([[Snake Style]]) or [[Martial Arts]] ([[Crane Style]]); [[Martial Arts]] ([[Tiger Style]]) wouldn’t do. 
## [[Melee]] 
Attacks with this weapon normally use [[Melee]]. 
## Natural
This weapon is part of the user’s body. It cannot be disarmed, and never requires a draw/ready weapon action to prepare for use. 
## Piercing
This weapon specializes in defeating armor, either by punching through it or slipping through its weak points. A piercing attack lowers the attacker’s [[Defense]] by one until his next turn, and costs one [[Initiative]] to attempt. The resulting withering attack ignores 4 points of soak from armor. 
## Reaching
This long weapon negates the advantages of mounted combatants (p. 202). 
## [[Shield]]
A weapon with this tag allows the character to place the “full defense” action in a flurry, although this flurry can’t also contain an attack action. This is normally used to flurry full defense and rush actions together. The damage of shield-tagged weapons is 2 lower than their class would otherwise indicate (thus a medium shield tagged weapon would have damage 7 rather than 9). 
## Smashing
This weapon can make smash attacks. Smash attacks sacrifice one [[Defense]] until the character’s next turn, and cost two [[Initiative]] to attempt. If successful, they knock the opponent back one range band, or knock them prone. Targets may be knocked back into dangerous or deadly threats, like lava pits or steep cliffs. 
## [[Thrown]]
This weapon can be used to make ranged attacks using the [[Thrown]] ability. All [[Thrown]] weapons also have their maximum range listed in parenthesis, such as [[Thrown]] (Medium). When throwing a weapon, the wielder doesn’t benefit from the weapon’s normal [[Accuracy]] bonus; see [[Thrown]] Weapons, below. 
## Two-Handed
This weapon requires the user wield it with both hands, preventing them from holding a shield or another weapon at the same time. Two-handed weapons grant a +2 bonus to [[Clash]] attacks. 
## Worn
Wearable weapons can be removed, but while worn they count as natural weapons. Equipping or removing a weapon with the worn tag takes an action.
# Ranged Weapon Tags
## [[Archery]]
This weapon can be used to make ranged attacks using the [[Archery]] ability. All [[Archery]] weapons also have their maximum range listed in parenthesis, such as [[Archery]] (Medium). 
## Bashing
This weapon normally does bashing damage when used to deliver a decisive attack. Concealable: The weapon can be easily hidden on the user’s person (difficulty 1 to do so with a [[Larceny]] roll). 
## [[Crossbow]]
Crossbow weapons do not add [[Strength]] to the wielder’s damage roll. Instead, add +4 to the to the weapon’s damage to calculate the raw damage of withering attacks with a weapon that has the crossbow tag. 
## Flame
This weapon shoots a narrow blast of fire, which can ignite flammable objects, but is extremely limited in range. [[Charms]] that increase weapon range cannot increase the range of any weapon with the flame tag unless the Charm specifically says it can. Flame weapons do not add [[Strength]] to the wielder’s damage roll. Instead, add +4 to the weapon’s damage to calculate the raw damage of withering attacks with a weapon that has the flame tag. Also, mundane flame weapons have an [[Accuracy]] of +0 at Close range (rather than -2), while artifact flame weapons have a Close [[Accuracy]] modifier of +1. 
## Lethal
This weapon normally does lethal damage when used to deliver a decisive attack, but fowling arrows and bolts allow bows and crossbows to inflict bashing damage. 
## Mounted
The wielder can use this weapon while mounted on a horse or other steed. 
## One-Handed
Most archery weapons require wielders to use both hands to fire. However, this weapon can be wielded in one hand, leaving the wielder’s other hand free. 
## Piercing
Piercing weapons specialize in defeating armor, either by punching through it or slipping through its weak points. A piercing attack costs 1 [[Initiative]] to attempt, and ignores 4 points of soak from armor. 
## Powerful
At close range, a powerful weapon inflicts damage like a heavy weapon. 
## Slow
This weapon takes extra time to reload. The character must spend an action reloading this weapon. Reloading can be part of a flurry, including a flurry with an attack. [[Charms]] which allow multiple attacks in a single turn are inapplicable with slow weapons unless specified otherwise. 
## Special
The weapon has some unusual property explained in the description
# Armour Tags
## Buoyant
Most armor is made from metal, which means it’s heavy and dense, and its mobility penalty applies to swimming. Armor with the buoyant tag is much lighter and does not inhibit swimming at all. 
## Concealable
Most armor is obviously armor. It can be decorated, but not disguised. Armor with the concealable tag can be worn under clothing so as not to reveal that the character is wearing armor. 
## Silent
All armor can be camouflaged with paint, grease or even dirt, but most armor is noisy. Armor with the silent tag causes no penalties to silent movement.
