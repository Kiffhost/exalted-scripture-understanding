Drinking deep of those secrets hidden by the moon’s dark face, the Lunar’s understanding of cosmic mysteries flourishes. She gains the [[Thaumaturgist]] Merit. She may subsequently learn up to five dots worth of thaumaturgical rituals for no experience point cost, although she must still have access to a tutor for them (Exalted, p. 490). This Charm may be purchased up to (Essence/2, rounded up) times.
