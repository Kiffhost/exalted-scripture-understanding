*The consummate Abyssal actress studies her role in such depth that she vanishes within it.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal creates a persona or role, designing a separate set of Intimacies for it. It must have at least four Intimacies, including one Major and one Defining Intimacy. Her role can be wholly fictional or an impersonation of a specific individual, in which case it has all of his Intimacies that the Abyssal knows of.
Using this Charm lets the deathknight assume this role after a few hours spent playing the part, studying the role, attending to costuming, or the like. The role’s Intimacies fully replace her own, which are suppressed and treated as if she didn’t have them.
While in a role, its Intimacies can be changed as usual, though the Abyssal gains +1 non-Charm Resolve against instill rolls that fundamentally contradict its character concept. Likewise, the Abyssal can’t voluntarily form such Intimacies. Any Intimacies gained by the role aren’t carried over to the Abyssal’s true Intimacies.
Leaving the role requires another use of this Charm, which requires the deathknight to spend at least a few minutes mentally separating herself from the role.
This Charm can be purchased up to (Essence) times to create multiple roles.
