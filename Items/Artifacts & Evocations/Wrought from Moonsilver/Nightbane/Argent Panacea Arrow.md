Nightbane’s arrows scour venom and pestilence from the blood. Its wielder performs a gambit targeting a character suffering a poison or disease, making an ([[Intelligence]] + [lower of [[Archery]] or Medicine]) attack roll and her [[Initiative]] roll against a poison’s remaining duration or disease’s morbidity. [[Charms]] that enhance rolls to treat poison or disease, as appropriate, can apply to this gambit’s attack roll. Success completely purges a poison from a character’s system, or lets a character immediately roll ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) against a disease’s morbidity, without the risk of intensifying his symptoms on failure. Outside combat, this Evocation can be used without an [[Initiative]] roll. 

## Resonant

If the wielder upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] by successfully using this Evocation, she gains one [[Willpower]].
