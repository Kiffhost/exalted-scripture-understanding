This disease is among the most terrible of Malfeas, a horrifying sickness born of Ligier’s mad green light. When inflicted through Infernal Charms, it has virulence and morbidity of (Essence + 2), a one-day interval, and the following supernatural effects:
- **Minor Symptom**: The wasting’s victim seems to have an extreme sunburn, rapidly developing hot sores surrounding his wounds and losing his hair clump by clump. His wound penalty is increased by one on Appearance- and Charisma-based rolls except threaten rolls.
- **Major Symptom**: The victim’s sores worsen into cancerous boils and pulsating sarcomas. His wound penalty is increased by one on all actions, or by two on actions penalized by the Minor version. He’s treated as having the Hideous Merit (Exalted, p. 162).
- **Defining Symptom**: The victim’s organs begin to necrotize and liquefy into a bloody slurry. His wound penalties subtract successes rather than dice and the rate at which he naturally heals is halved (Exalted, p. 173).
- **Death**: The victim dies in grotesque agony, leaving behind a corpse no animal will feed on.
