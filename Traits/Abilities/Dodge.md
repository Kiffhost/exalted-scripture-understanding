**This Ability is important in combat.** 

[[Dodge]] is the skill of evading one’s enemies, deftly maneuvering out of the way of attacks or managing to avoid the dangers of fighting on hazardous terrain. In combat, a character’s [[Dodge]] rating contributes to her [[Defense|Evasion]], but is also used to escape from close-quarter conflicts with enemies or to take cover from the attacks of far-off foes.
