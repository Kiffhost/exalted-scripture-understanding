*The martial artist cleanses a patient’s body and spirit, striking away afflictions as cool rain washes away blood and tears.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the stylist expands Perfect Reconstruction Method with two of the following techniques, letting her forgo healing from a successful roll or extra successes to treat other ailments or empower her patient in other ways. She must still pay Perfect Reconstruction Method’s costs normally unless otherwise noted. If the stylist fails a roll to cure a patient of a malady, like a crippling effect or Derangement, she can’t reuse this Charm on that effect for him.
The stylist can use multiple techniques together. Some techniques require her to pay a surcharge; others require prerequisite techniques.
### Essence-Aligning Touch
The stylist can forgo one level of healing to grant her patient four motes. She can also transfer her own motes to her patient by foregoing additional levels at a rate of four motes per level. She doesn’t need to pay a mote or Initiative cost for extra successes used on this technique.
### Will-Tempering Touch (Requires Essence-Aligning Touch)
The stylist can forgo one level of healing to grant her patient one Willpower. She can also transfer her own Willpower to her patient by foregoing additional levels, at a rate of one Willpower per level. She doesn’t need to pay a mote or Initiative cost for extra successes used on this technique.
### Forgotten Wound Remedy (Requires Will-Tempering Touch)
The stylist can forgo one level of healing to erase a scene’s worth of memories that are painful or a source of grief or regret. A character presented with evidence of his erased memories may pay three Willpower to restore a single scene’s worth of them.
### Impurity-Purging Flow
The stylist can completely purge a disease or poison from her patient’s system by forgoing levels of healing equal to its morbidity.
She can reduce the duration of poisons for one level of healing per interval.
### Wound Negation Touch (Requires Impurity-Purging Flow)
The stylist can reduce crippling penalties from temporary injures by one point per level of healing she forgoes. Reducing an effect’s penalty to zero negates it completely.
### Spiritual Parasite Banishment
The stylist can banish a possessing spirit or other entity inhabiting her patient by forgoing (his Essence, maximum 5) levels of healing. If his Essence is lower than hers, she need only forgo a single level of healing.
### Hex Negation Technique (Requires Spiritual Parasite Banishment)
The stylist can negate a sorcerous curse, like the spell Corrupted Words (Exalted, p. 472), or a Shaping effect by forgoing levels of healing equal to the Essence of the character responsible, maximum 5.
The stylist can purchase additional techniques for eight experience points each.
### Enlightenment
The stylist can also learn the following techniques. Getimians can only use them while their Essence is Flowing.
Essence Template Restoration (+25m, 2wp; requires ### Wound Negation Touch)
The stylist can heal permanent crippling effects, forgoing two levels per point of penalty for missing digits, a lost eye, a mangled foot, etc.; three levels per point for a severed hand, congenital blindness, organ failure, etc.; or four levels per point for severed limbs, destroyed vital organs, and other grievous maiming.
Psyche-Cleansing Technique (+25m, 2wp; requires ### Forgotten Wound Remedy)
The stylist can lower a Derangement’s intensity one step, to a minimum of Minor, by forgoing (its intensity) levels of healing. She can negate a Psyche effect by forgoing levels of healing equal to the Essence of the character responsible, maximum 5.
