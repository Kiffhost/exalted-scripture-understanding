*An electric understanding arcs between the Dragon-Blood and one who shares her values.*
When she uses oratory to make an inspire, instill, or persuade roll that is supported by a Principle that her target shares with her, she adds non-Charm bonus dice equal to (the [[Intimacy]] of whichever of them has the [[Intimacy|Principle]] at the lowest rating). If she targets multiple characters, all of them must share the same [[Intimacy|Principle]] with her for her to benefit from this Charm.
