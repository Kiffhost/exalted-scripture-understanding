*The [[Essence]] of the Dragon-Blood’s presence flows into her target’s mind like seeping water, finding a place in his memories wherein she can exist.*
She rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Presence]]) as a special instill roll, describing a past encounter between the two of them that never happened. If she beats the target’s [[Resolve]], she creates a false memory, up to five minutes long, of that encounter. The memory is focused solely on the interaction between the two, whether that was a conversation, a dance at a soiree, an introduction as children, or a street brawl. Implausible claims (Exalted, p. 215) in this false version of events do not inflict penalties; instead they subtract successes equal to the penalty they’d normally inflict. If a target has never met the Dragon-Blood before, he forms a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards her, with an emotional context chosen by his player based on the nature of the false memory. He cannot voluntarily weaken this [[Intimacy|Tie]]. For him to resist this influence, other characters must fully erode the [[Intimacy]] using social influence or magic, at which point he may pay one [[Willpower]] to recognize the false memory for an illusion. A character who already knows the Dragon-Blood can still have his memories altered. He still forms a new Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] based on the false memory, but doesn’t need to erode it before he may pay [[Willpower]] to recognize a discrepancy between the false memory and what he knows about the Dragon-Blood. This Charm may only be used against any given character once per story.
