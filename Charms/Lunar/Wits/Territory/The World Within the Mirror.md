The Lunar claims a twofold dominion, stalking behind the mirrors of her sacred ground.
Each of the Lunar’s territories has an otherworldly reflection, a twinned mirror-world born of her protean [[Essence]]. She can access a territory’s mirror-realm by using [[Mirror Slip Trick]] on a reflective surface within it, and can bring her Circle and up to ([[Essence]] x2) other characters with her when she does so. In combat, leaving that reflective surface to enter the mirror-realm proper requires withdrawing from combat (Exalted, p.
199).
The reflected territory is not completely identical to the original, for Lunar [[Essence]] is a fickle mirror. The sky is always midnight, and the moon looms larger and brighter than it should. The mirror-world’s wilderness is more verdant than the original; its cities are ruined or overgrown. Light is starker, shadows deeper, and heights and depths seem far greater. It counts as a greater Lunar demesne, though it has no hearthstone. This reflection doesn’t extend past the territory’s boundaries; beyond them, there is only darkness.
The mirror-world is a lonely place. The reflections of people and beasts are trapped within the glass of their mirrors, unable to break away and find the larger mirror-world. Visitors might sometimes hear the sound of rustling underfoot or the cries of strange beasts, but never find any trace of their existence. Others can follow the Lunar into the mirror-realm using magic like [[Silver Curtain Parted]] or Obsidian Shards of Infinity style, and if there should be strange things that dwell behind mirrors, they may intrude.
The Lunar can travel through the mirror-realm to observe her territory through mirrors and other reflective surfaces. Nontrivial characters can make [[Awareness]] rolls to notice her in the mirror, but suffer a −4 penalty on rolls against her [[Stealth]] unless they have reason to suspect they’re being watched through mirrors.
The Lunar can use [[Mirror Slip Trick]] on any reflective surface in the mirror-world to reenter her territory, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost. Characters without such magic aren’t trapped — they can return through a reflective surface with a difficulty 4 roll using a (Mental Attribute + [[Occult]]) roll to understand the mirror-world’s nature or ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) to smash their way back.
