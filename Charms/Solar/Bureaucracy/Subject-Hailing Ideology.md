The Lawgiver gains power through knowledge of the roles and identities of others. This Charm supplements any social influence that appeals to an [[Intimacy]] the Solar is aware of, at a former intensity, so long as the social influence is intended to make the subject act in some official capacity. For example, the Lawgiver could attempt to persuade her bodyguard-turned-assassin to put down his weapon, invoking an [[Intimacy]] of loyalty he once held but holds no longer. She could convince an ex-spouse to act in some capacity as if they were still married. She could even make a once-loyal member of her organization remember his role and even make him wish to return to his former position. However, she could not use this Charm to convince two enemies who have become lovers to remember their hate for one another. The Charm only functions if there is some relevant official capacity being invoked. Thus the subject is hailed into a former role.
