Some Charms let player characters go into experience debt to increase trait ratings or gain new traits. Once a character incurs experience debt, any experience she subsequently receives go toward paying it off until it’s paid in full. An Exalt’s player may choose to pay a debt solely with Lunar Experience or the like, if applicable. A character in experience debt can’t incur further experience debts; she must pay off the debt before she can benefit from other such effects. Storyteller characters never go into experience debt; instead, they can only benefit from such an effect once per story.
