Those who consume food or drink within which a spirit’s been bound risk contracting drunken moth sickness. The spirit’s thoughts — or those of a Citrine Poxes stylist — infect the victim’s mind with one of the spirit’s Principles — or one of a Citrine Poxes stylist’s. The victim counts as having that [[Intimacy|Principle]] at this disease’s intensity. It’s a Psyche effect as well as a disease; rolls against it use ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) instead of ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). It can also be cured by exorcism, using the spirit or stylist’s [[Resolve]]. Medical treatment is useless unless enhanced by magic. 
# Minor
The victim can’t regain [[Willpower]] from sleep if she’s acted against the [[Intimacy|Principle]] the day before. 
# Major
As above, and when the victim has the opportunity to act on the [[Intimacy|Principle]], the Storyteller may force him to do so unless he enters a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and cites an [[Intimacy]] of equal or greater intensity to spend one [[Willpower]]. This counts as a botch toward the limit the disease can inflict (Exalted, p. 234). 
# Defining
As above, and when the victim acts in a way that aligns with the [[Intimacy|Principle]], the Storyteller chooses one of his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] to weaken by one step. He can spend one [[Willpower]] to resist a Defining [[Intimacy]] being weakened. 
# Death
The victim’s mind is emptied of all but the disease’s [[Intimacy|Principle]], suppressing his other [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] and preventing him from taking any action that doesn’t directly advance the [[Intimacy|Principle]]. Death typically results from dehydration or similar self-neglect. This can kill even the Exalted, though they may be more resilient to deprivation than mortal victims.
