*As she gazes down from a superior social vantage, the complexities of courtly intrigues lay themselves bare before the Dragon-Blood.*
She makes a single read intentions roll against all characters she can perceive, doubling 9s. She may either attempt to determine each of their intentions in the current scene—for instance, scanning an office of functionaries to determine which ones are working dutifully, which are lazing, and which are in the process of embezzling; or she can attempt to identify their [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] on a single topic—discerning how the members of a prince’s court feel about him, or the reasons why a mob of peasant is protesting a satrap’s rule. 
Even if her roll fails to overcome a character’s [[Guile]], she doesn’t need to reset her read intentions action before attempting it against him again in the same scene. 
This Charm can only be used once per day.
