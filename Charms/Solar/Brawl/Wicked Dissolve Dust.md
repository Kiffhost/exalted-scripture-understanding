Feeling the tide of momentum turn against her, the Solar draws a shield against her doom. When in control of a clinch, the Exalt can use Wicked Dissolve Dust to interpose her captive between herself and an incoming decisive attack, enacting a reflexive Dexterity + Brawl clash attack. If her clash succeeds, rather than doing damage to the attacker, all of the damage of the opponentâ€™s decisive attack is transferred to her captive.
