*Locked in a bind, the Scar’s acid blunts edges and splinters wood.*

A successful disarm also corrodes the target’s weapon. It suffers −4 Damage and −1 Overwhelming, minimum 0. This lasts until the end of the scene for artifact weapons, while mundane weapons require a repair project.

The wielder can use this Evocation to weaken weapons that can’t be disarmed, like Worn weapons. It can’t affect unarmed attacks or natural weapons.

With Essence 2, if the wielder rolls 3+ extra successes on the Initiative roll against a mundane weapon wielded by an enemy with a Principle or pride or vanity or a Tie towards material objects, the weapon is destroyed completely.
### Dissonant
The wielder doesn’t gain this Evocation’s Essence 2 benefit.
