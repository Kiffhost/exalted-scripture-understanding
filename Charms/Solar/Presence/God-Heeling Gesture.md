Presence suffused with the Essence of divinity, the Solar wields her charisma to restore order. The Exalt may use this Charm once per round on her turn to make a sudden gesture or action that completely reverses a lesser miracle. Generally this works without a roll, but if the Storyteller deems it necessary, roll a clash between the Charisma + Presence of the two characters. Thus with a clap of her hands, the Solar can cause a withered flower to stand back up and bloom brightly. With a stomp of her foot she can cause a spring that dried out centuries ago to well up with fresh water. Altering a spirit’s dominion in this fashion automatically informs the spirit of the presence of one of the Solar Exalted. No other being could so casually gainsay a god.

### On God-Heeling Gesture

This Charm cannot be used to counter the effects of magic that supplements or creates an attack. Use your noggin when adjudicating where and when to allow this Charm in play. If “winter thaw” cruelly kills a random sparrow, the Solar can make a mudra to restore the bird to life. If the Solar’s sparrow familiar is killed by a lightning bolt hurled by a god, nothing can restore it to life.
