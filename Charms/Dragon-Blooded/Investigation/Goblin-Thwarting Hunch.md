The eerie touch of the Wyld is like a film of pollution to the Dragon-Blood’s keen eye, an unsettling sign that the enemies of Creation are at work. She doubles 9s on a profile character roll or read intentions roll against a Fair Folk or other creature native to the Wyld, a case scene roll to find clues left behind by such creatures or by the influence of the Wyld itself, or on any Awareness, Lore, Occult, or Survival rolls to detect the influence of the Wyld.
