*The scent of spies and eavesdroppers wrinkles the Lunar’s nose.*
When a character she’s unaware of rolls to read her intentions, she reflexively rolls ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Socialize}) with ([[Essence]]) bonus successes opposing his [[Guile]]. Success removes the −2 [[Guile]] penalty for being unaware of her observer (Exalted, 218). If the Lunar subsequently reads her observer’s intentions or threatens him that scene, she adds a success.
