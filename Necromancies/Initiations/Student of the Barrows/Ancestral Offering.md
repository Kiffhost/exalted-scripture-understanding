*Once per night, the necromancer may perform a ceremonial [[Sacrifice]] to a powerful ancestor or group of ghosts, rolling ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) at difficulty (5 – [[Resources]] value of her [[Sacrifice]]).*
She may instead offer up to a maximum of five [[Health Track|Health Levels]] worth of blood freshly drawn from herself or another in place of material [[Sacrifice]], using the number of health levels in place of a Resources value. She gains ([[Essence]] + extra successes) necromantic motes, which last until the story ends or she makes another offering.
