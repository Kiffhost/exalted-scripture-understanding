*The Lunar witch commands the loyalty of otherworldly companions, familiar spirits, and faithful hobgoblins pledged to her service.*
The Lunar may take willing spirits and fae of up to [[Essence]] 3 as familiars. She can have up to ([[Essence]]) such familiars at a time. Spirits and fae that are sorcerously bound by someone else can’t be taken as familiars.
A Lunar who knows [[Moon-in-Well Emanation]] (Lunars, p. 159) treats her reflection-spirit as a familiar. It doesn’t count toward this Charm’s limit.
