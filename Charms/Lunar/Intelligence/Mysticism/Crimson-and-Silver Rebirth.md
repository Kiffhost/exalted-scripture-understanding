The Lunar washes away the Wyld’s corruption or sorceroustransformationswithherproteanblood.Sheremoves a mutation from a willing character, rolling (Intelligence + [Lore, Medicine, or Occult]) against difficulty (mutation’s dot rating). Alternatively, she can undo a shaping effect that alters the body, rolling (Intelligence + [Lore, Medicine, or Occult]) against the character who used the effect, who contests with an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) combination. If she fails, she can’t attempt to remove that mutation or shaping again. The Lunar may remove mutations or shaping effects she inflicted without rolling, waiving this Charm’s mote and Willpower costs.
