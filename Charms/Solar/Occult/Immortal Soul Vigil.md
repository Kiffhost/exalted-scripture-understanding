*The Solar may use the prerequisite to enter the psyche of another, examining his dreams and memories, no matter how distant or forgotten, for traces of spiritual taint, demonic possession, or other signs of haunting.*
While entranced, the Solar experiences the dream or memory of her subject in first person, and may interact with the world of her subject’s mind using [[Awareness]], [[Investigation]] and [[Occult]] [[Charms]] to look for signs of spiritual predation. Though she cannot use her presence in her subject’s mind to change his memory’s outcome, she can use what she discovers as a basis for further action. Furthermore, if she is able to confirm the presence of a spirit actor in her subject’s past, she may also commit seven motes to create a doorway which opens in her mind the moment her subject is approached by the spirit. The moment she steps through it, the Exalt falls into a trance and experiences a dematerialized state that allows her to enter the scene through the dreamscape of her subject, where she may confront the spirit with all of the force that is hers to wield. While the Solar may not interact with any other physical beings in this state, if the spirit attempts to escape her by materializing, the Solar may still perceive and attack it by using [[Charms]] such as [[Spirit-Detecting Glance]].
