The icy sting of the Dragon-Blood’s murderous intent freezes her victim’s blood in his veins. When she lands an unexpected decisive attack with any Ability against an enemy who hasn’t acted this round, he loses one [[Initiative]], or ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] on an ambush, which she doesn’t gain. If this deals 3+ levels of decisive damage to him, the chill prevents him from taking a movement action that round, except to rise from prone, and from taking any movement created by [[Charms]] even if it doesn’t count as a movement action.
In Air Aura, the Dragon-Blood gains any [[Initiative]] her victim loses before she rolls damage.
