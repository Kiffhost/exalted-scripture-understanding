*The Sidereal fights fiercely to preserve what little free time she has, shortening her labors with stolen productivity.*
The Sidereal saps productivity from a project or bureaucratic task, rolling (Wits + Larceny) opposing the project leader’s ({Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation} + Bureaucracy). If successful, the time needed to complete the project is multiplied by (2 + extra successes).
This doesn’t affect physical labor, only the planning, authorization, allocation of resources, and similar bureaucratic tasks.
The Sidereal can apply the stolen productivity to a project or task of any kind using any Ability, applying the same multiplier to the speed at which she works at the above tasks. This doesn’t stack with other magic that speeds her efforts. She can’t apply this benefit to a task that would normally take significantly longer to complete than the sabotaged project would.
