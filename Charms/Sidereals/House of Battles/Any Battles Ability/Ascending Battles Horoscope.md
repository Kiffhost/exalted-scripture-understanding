*The Sidereal proclaims Mars’ favor to warriors, generals, athletes, and hellraisers.* 
The Sidereal blesses another character with good fortune in a certain kind of battle, conflict, or competition: defending his home city, battling demons, prevailing in games of skill, etc. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one [[Willpower]] for others. 
One per scene, the blessed character’s player may gain −1 target number on an attack roll, [[Join Battle]] roll, [[War]] roll, or roll relevant to nonviolent conflict. Blessing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options. Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. 
### Excessive Valor Reward ([[Constellations#The Banner|The Banner]])
The Sidereal’s target boasts about his accomplishments. 
### Foretold Victory Blessing ([[Constellations#The Quiver|The Quiver]])
The Sidereal’s arget heeds her advice in matters of tactics or strategy, whether on or off the battlefield. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively.
### Instructive Hostility Auspice ([[Constellations#The Spear|The Spear]])
The Sidereal’s target argues, competes, spars, or fights with her. 
### Soul-Strengthening Conviction ([[Constellations#The Gauntlet|The Gauntlet]])
The Sidereal’s target commits to making a risky or costly decision. 
### Star-Favored Guardian ([[Constellations#The Shield|The Shield]])
The Sidereal’s target puts himself in harm’s way for her. The Sidereal can bless multiple characters with this Charm.
