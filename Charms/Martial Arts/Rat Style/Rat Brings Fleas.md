*Embracing the most underhanded of tactics, the stylist wields disease as a weapon.*
If a decisive attack deals damage, the stylist’s target must roll against infected wounds (Exalted, p. 235), even if he has Exalted Healing. If he’s infected, he loses (stylist’s Essence) Initiative. The stylist can convey other diseases with an appropriate stunt, like fouling her blade to convey cholera. A surprise attack subtracts two successes from the enemy’s roll against the disease. An ambush causes him to fail automatically.
## Special activation rules
This Charm can be used with others that inflict disease, causing the victim to lose Initiative if infected and penalizing him on unexpected attacks as above.
## Mastery
Add +2 to the disease’s virulence and morbidity.
