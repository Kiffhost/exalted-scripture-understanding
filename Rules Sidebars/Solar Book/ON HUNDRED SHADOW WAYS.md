Say you’ve used [[Hundred Shadow Ways|this Charm]] to lock out Hungry Tiger Technique. An attack enhanced solely by Hungry Tiger Technique automatically fails. Now the opponent throws a combination of Hungry Tiger Technique and Fire and Stones Strike—the attack still occurs, but Hundred Shadow Ways automatically removes the benefit of Hungry Tiger Technique from the attack. This Charm can be used to “learn” as many Charms as the Exalt’s mote pool can afford.
