# [[Centipede Style]]
Centipede style is defined by speed, using swift barrages of blows to wear down enemies and nimble footwork to outmaneuver them. Once a stylist’s many strikes have left her opponent reeling, she can grapple him to restrain his movement, deliver a telling blow to an unguarded weak point, or unleash this style’s deadly venoms. Its schools are most prominent in the East, often boasting rivalries with Snake schools or syncretizing the two styles, but it’s also commonly taught in the South and West.
## Weapons
Centipede unarmed attacks combine punches and kicks in rapid succession. Stylists also use fighting chains, hook swords, iron boots, seven-sections staffs, and tiger claws. 
## Armour
This style is compatible with light armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Athletics]] and [[Dodge]] enable this style’s speed and mobility.
