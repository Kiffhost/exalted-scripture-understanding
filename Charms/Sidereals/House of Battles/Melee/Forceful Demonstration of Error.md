Not satisfied with simply revealing the weakness of her enemy’s offense, the Sidereal counters his imperfect blow with a display of true excellence. The Sidereal reflexively clashes an attack with a decisive attack, and can even clash attacks against other characters, as per Instructive Riposte. She can use that Charm’s second purchase to enhance such clashes.
