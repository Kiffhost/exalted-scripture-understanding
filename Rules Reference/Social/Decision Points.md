## Decision Points
In the Decision Point, the player must choose an [[Intimacy]] and explain how it justifies resisting that specific influence. The [[intimacy]] chosen must fulfil the following requirements: 
- The [[Intimacy]] he chooses must be of equal or greater intensity than the [[Intimacy]] which supported the influence roll.
- It can’t be the one that strengthened his [[Resolve]] against the roll in the first place—the influence already overcame that particular source of reluctance when it beat his [[Resolve]], after all. 
- The Storyteller must accept the player’s argument for why one of his Intimacies would make him reject the influence.
If those requirements are met, then the character may spend 1 [[Willpower]] point to resist the influence roll. Otherwise, resistance is impossible.

<summary>Example Decision Point</summary>
As an example Decision Point, consider Son of Wolves, a [[Zenith]] Caste whose [[Resolve]] rating has just been overcome by the influence roll of Naya, a scheming Sidereal. The Sidereal seeks to turn him against his Circle (a serious task), and her [[persuade]] action is supported by Son of Wolves’s Major [[Intimacy#Principle|Principle]] of belief in the Immaculate Faith, which manifests as a lingering and unshakable conviction that he and his fellow [[Solar Exalted]] are Anathema. Unless Son of Wolves can match this with an [[Intimacy]] of Major or Defining intensity, he will be powerless to defy the truth he hears in Naya’s words. While he has a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty towards his Circlemates, he already used that [[Intimacy]] to bolster his [[Resolve]], rendering it unavailable in a Decision Point. Luckily, he also has a Major Principle of “I can’t abide a traitor,” owing back to a terrible betrayal he suffered long ago. His player argues that this allows him not to betray his Circlemates even if they are Anathema. The Storyteller accepts this argument, and Son of Wolves is able to spend a point of [[Willpower]] to resist.

### Lengthy Debates
Sometimes after a character has spent [[Willpower]] in a [[#Decision Points|Decision Point]] in order to reject influence, the initiate will return with a new or stronger argument. When this happens, the initiate is engaging the [[#Retrying Social Actions|reset rules for social actions]]. If the same issue is being argued as a result, the target may not use an [[Intimacy]] which boosted his [[Resolve]] against the initial roll. After all, that logic was not enough to stop him from being forced into the Decision Point in the first place. 

To boost his [[Resolve]] against the initiate’s second attempt, he must find another [[Intimacy]] to raise his Resolve—or use the one that allowed him to reject influence in the Decision Point. Remember that the [[Intimacy]] a character uses to raise his [[Resolve]] cannot be invoked in a Decision Point. This rule continues to apply throughout the story—as long as the initiate can find new angles with which to demonstrate the rightness of her persuasion, she can cause her target to use up all of his valid excuses over the course of a story. When a character has no valid Intimacies with which to enter a Decision Point, beating his [[Resolve]] will finally convince him to agree with the initiate’s arguments. Thus a prophet may soften the heart of a prince over time.
