*The Sidereal reminds the world of the great sacrifices she must one day make in its service, winning a reprieve from her current suffering.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm when she fails a roll with any Ability against an environmental hazard, trap, or similar danger or to navigate a marine hazard (Exalted, p. 244) to roll again. It receives the benefits of all magic used to enhance the first roll; the Sidereal can use additional Charms as well. If she succeeds, she gains one Willpower.
With a Survival 4, Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can use this Charm on an ally’s behalf. This works as if that character had used this Charm himself, except that the Willpower from a successful roll is awarded to the Sidereal. If she protects multiple characters against the same peril, uses past the first cost only three motes.
