*The Lunar shapeshifts wounds away, closing cuts and healing bruises.*
She heals one level of non-aggravated damage at the start of each of her turns. This Charm ends if she’s crashed. Outside of combat, the Lunar heals ([[Stamina]]) levels of non-aggravated damage over the course of a minute. This Charm can only be used once per day. It doesn’t reset if the Lunar still has damage in her health track at the beginning of the new day, or doesn’t receive adequate sleep.
