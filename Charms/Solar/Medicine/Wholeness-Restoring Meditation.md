Regrowth of lost or missing tissues is a much more challenging affair, as is the repair of deformities, Wyld mutation or mental Derangements. However, the Solarâ€™s prowess is such that of these, only Derangements cannot be fully cured. In each case, the Storyteller should decide if the wound, malady or defectisMinor,Major,orDefining.Definingwouldinclude paralysis, lost limbs, missing eyes, complete lunacy, and mutations that renders a person completely incapable of a normal human life.
