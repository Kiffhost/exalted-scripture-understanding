*It is the Infernal’s will that she not be attacked. Who can gainsay her?*

To use this Charm, the Infernal’s anima must be at burning or higher. It crystallizes into a force construct around her, adding +1 Defense and (Essence) soak. She waives the Initiative cost for full defense actions, letting her use them while crashed, and can flurry them with non-attack actions. The shield shines as a burning anima (p. XX).

While using this Charm, the Infernal reduces the cost of [[Crystal-Fire Pattern Construct]] by two motes.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has the [[Barrier Defense]] feature, this Charm’s Defense bonus is non-Charm.
