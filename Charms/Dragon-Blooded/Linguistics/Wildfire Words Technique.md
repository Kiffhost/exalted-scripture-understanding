The Dragon-Blood’s words spread across Creation like swift-burning flame, a thousand tongues of fire repeating her message in every direction. She makes a written (Charisma + Linguistics) instill roll with (Essence) non-Charm dice to create or strengthen an Intimacy based on a strong passion — love, anger, valor, fear, lust, or the like. She rolls an additional non-Charm die for every 10 on the roll. On a success, the instilled Intimacy can’t be altered or removed for the next (6 − his Integrity) days, although it can be weakened. The next time the target engages in a conversation during this time, he’s overcome with a burning urge to spread that Intimacy, and must attempt his own instill roll against all listeners, adding (Exalt’s Essence) non-Charm dice. His words don’t convey this Charm’s effect, though he may direct listeners to the Dragon-Blood’s text. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Intimacy based on fiery passions with a Linguistics roll.
