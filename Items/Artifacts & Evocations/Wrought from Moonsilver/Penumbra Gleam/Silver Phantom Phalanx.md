Bracing against attacks, the wielder throws off a host of images displaying how she might defend against it, confounding her foes. Every point of Reflection she spends adds +1 Parry, maximum (Perception/2). A foe may spend one Willpower to pierce this illusion, ignoring the bonus. 

## Resonant

If the wielder took a full defense on her turn, enemies canâ€™t resist with Willpower. 

## Dissonant

Each +1 Parry costs two Reflection, not one.
