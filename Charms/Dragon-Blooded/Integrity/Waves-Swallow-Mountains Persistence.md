Against the persistence of the tides, even the mightiest arguments crumble into dust. When the Dragon-Blood asserts her Resolve against an influence roll, up to (Essence/2, round up) 1s on the opposing character’s influence roll each subtract a success. If the Dragon-Blood uses this Charm multiple times in the same scene against a single character’s influence, each subsequent use increases the maximum penalty by one, to a maximum of (Essence), and counts the next-highest number towards the penalty. On her second use, 1s and 2s would subtract successes; on the third, 1s, 2s, and 3s would. This Charm can only be used against a single character each scene, although there’s no limit on how many times the Dragon-Blood may use it against him.
