*The Sidereal invokes Mercury’s auspices to place obstacles in a traveler’s path.*
The Sidereal and her target make opposed (Wits + Journeys Ability) rolls. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one Willpower for others. Success curses him, inflicting misfortune on a journey named by the Sidereal.
He suffers +1 target number on Athletics, Resistance, Ride, Sail, and Survival rolls involving the journey outside of combat. Once per session, when he fails such a roll, it counts as a botch, introducing a new complication to his journey.
Cursing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options.
Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece.
### Cracked Foundation Curse (The Mast)
The Sidereal’s target refuses to provide aid to someone performing a difficult task, whether it’s requested of them or not.
### Flea-Bitten Karma (The Gull)
The Sidereal’s target ignores or denies a request for the bare essentials of life — enough food to not go hungry, enough money to just barely scrape by, somewhere warm to sleep for a night, etc.
### Forsaken Castaway Curse (The Captain)
The Sidereal’s target abandons someone, literally or figuratively, or leaves something important that’s been entrusted to him behind.
### Never Look Back (The Ship’s Wheel)
The Sidereal’s target sets out on a journey, path, route, or course of action she suggested but subsequently abandons it. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively, typically to curse his journey back.
### Thrown Shoe Negligence (The Messenger)
The Sidereal’s target neglects a duty, job, or obligation he’s agreed to perform.
The Sidereal can curse multiple characters with this Charm.
