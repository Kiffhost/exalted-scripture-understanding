Singing [[Shield]] Technique Alien music pours from the shield in a standing wave — a summons to the demon realm that has already been heard and answered. At [[Initiative]] 15+, the Exalt may use this Evocationreflexivelyonherturn.Theairroilsandpartsto admitaFirstCircleDemon,bound—asthoughsummoned by [[sorcery]] (Exalted, p. 473) — to the task of aiding her in this battle. The Exalt rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Occult]]) against the [[Resolve]] of the type of demon she wishes to summon. On a success, the chosen demon appears; on a failure, the Storyteller chooses what kind of demon appears. If the demon survives, it returns to Hell at scene’s end. This Evocation can be activated once per scene. An [[Essence]] 4 repurchase allows the wielder to pay an additionaltenmotestosummonaSecondCircleDemononce per story. On a failed roll, the Storyteller chooses another Second Circle Demon that answers the call, although it is still bound unless she botches. This effect can’t be reset by the [[Dawn]] Caste anima power.
