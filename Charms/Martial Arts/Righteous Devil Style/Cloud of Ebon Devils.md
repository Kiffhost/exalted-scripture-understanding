Ebon grains of firedust stream from the stylistâ€™s hands as she moves like lightning, sighting and reloading faster than her enemies can blink. When the stylist aims with a firewand, she may also reload it (and/or draw it), without needing to take a separate action. If there are any enemies at close range to her, she must succeed on a (Wits + Martial Arts) roll at difficulty 2 to successfully execute this maneuver. On a failed roll, she successfully loads the weapon, but does not gain the advantages of aiming. Enemies whom she has successfully intimidated or chastised with social actions during that fight do not count for this restriction (even if they spent Willpower to resist). 

## Mastery

Cloud of Ebon Devils can be used to supplement a Join Battle roll, in which case it allows the Righteous Devil to reflexively aim and draw or ready a weapon before any character acts in the fight.
