*The Lunar hardens a strand of hair into a barbed quill, plucks a razor-sharp feather, or draws a similar projectile from her body.*
This can be used as bow or crossbow ammunition, or thrown as a dart (Exalted, p. 587). This Charm canâ€™t provide ammunition for firewands and other flame weapons. 
A [[Dexterity]] 3 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a one-[[Initiative]] surcharge to reflexively reload a crossbow or similar compatible weapon with the Slow tag. This lets her use it with magic that creates multiple attacks, if she reloads before each attack past the first.
