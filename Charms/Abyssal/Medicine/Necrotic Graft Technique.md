*The Abyssal’s unholy prowess marries living flesh to cadaverous rot,, uniting them with needle, thread, and [[Essence]].*
The Abyssal grafts undead flesh onto a willing character in a procedure that takes at least an hour, granting them up to ([[Intelligence]]) dots of mutations — Innate or Purchased [[Merits]] that alter or improve a character’s body — for which they must incur [[experience debt]]. When used on zombies and similar animated corpses, the Abyssal can instead grant up to ([[Intelligence]] + 1) dots of mutations.
These mutations are always gruesomely obvious, giving the recipient the [[Hideous]] Merit unless the deathknight also gives them the [[Subtlety|Subtle]] mutation. It’s possible to surgically remove these mutations, though the process is lengthy, painful, and damaging.
