With a glance the Solar discerns those passions that sit hidden in the soul of her subject, desires for which he’d take great personal risks or engage in behavior he would normally resist. This Charm is a read intentions action with (Essence) automatic successes, rerolling 5s and 6s until 5s and 6s fail to appear. If successful, the Solar learns her target’s price—that is, what will motivate him to undertake some specific task. The subject’s price might be the recovery of a lost possession, sex with an unachievable object of desire, aid in a personal endeavor, simple flattery and so on. If the Exalt knows Cunning Insight Technique, she may activate it in an attempt to confirm up to (Essence) Intimacies suggested by the subject’s price.
