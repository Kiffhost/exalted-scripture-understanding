*The Abyssal’s war cry is joined by the wails of the dead, breaking the will of her foes.*
The Abyssal imposes a −3 penalty on a rout check made by an enemy battle group within long range. For living battle groups, 1s on the rout check subtract successes. [[Rally]] rolls to avoid dissolution suffer the same penalties.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can enhance a [[threaten]] roll or other fear-based [[influence]] roll, inflicting −1 [[Resolve]] against living targets, or −2 for mortals. She ignores multiple target penalties.
With [[War]] 5, [[Essence]] 4, the Abyssal gains one [[Willpower]] if the battle group suffers dissolution, maximum once per scene.
