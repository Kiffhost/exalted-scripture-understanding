*The cycle of elements moves through all things, within and without.*
When a Dragon-Blooded wielder would enter an Elemental Aura, she may pay two motes to instead enter the Aura of the next element in the cycle — e.g., when she would enter Air Aura, she may instead enter Water Aura. This doesn’t let her avoid the restriction on her Aura while at bonfire anima (Dragon-Blooded, p. 162).
A Dragon-Blood who’s awakened [[Ascendant Omphalos Avatar]] waives this Evocation’s mote cost.
