*Before the First Age reached its height, Kesuth Amaldui of the Copper Spiders bound the soul of the mortal sorcerer Shou Ren into a jewel. In exchange for the sorcerer’s wisdom, Amaldui crafted a hidden world inside the stone for Shou Ren to rule. The [[Twilight]] set this jewel at the heart of a mighty mace. He became an enigma to his peers, seeming to converse with the mace he bore, and vanishing into its hidden world for months at a time. From the stone’s depths he called forth ghostly soldiers to garrison Hollow against the Forty-Fourth Immortal; into the stone’s depths he bound dark powers as he plumbed the Underworld for fell secrets. Centuries later, after the Dragon-Blooded burned Amaldui to death using his library as a pyre, [[Asphodel]] fell into the hands of the Eastern daimyos. From the prince in the jewel, its owners gleaned sorcerous secrets and the locations of other relics of the First Age, only to lose the weapon — and often their lives — to covetous rivals. [[Asphodel]] was last recorded during the Contagion, borne by Merach Ivira as she led the armies of Samisen against invading Fair Folk.*
[[Asphodel]] is a seven-flanged artifact mace of soulsteel. Its construction is airy and light, every surface inlaid with delicate white jade scrollwork. Where the flanges meet the shaft, they cage a fist-sized smoky gemstone of irregular, wavy facets. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of Asphodel! 
Whenever the Exalt is touching [[Asphodel]], she can converse with Shou Ren. She may call upon him for counsel regarding whatever lore he can share on a specific topic. The ghost can also serve as a tutor for appropriate Abilities, Specialties, spells, and sorcerous [[Merits]] (Exalted, p. 178). 
The wielder may petition Shou Ren for more tangible aid with a bargain action (Exalted, p. 216). If successful, he loans one of his retainers — such as a war ghost, spectral steed, mortwight, or jade effigy — to serve for one night. In exchange, he requests some piece of lost lore to enrich his library. If the Exalt has awakened [[Shadow-World Snare]], Shou Ren may instead solicit a specific ghost or type of undead to supplement his menagerie. If the wielder has awakened [[Enter the Hidden World]], Shou Ren may instead request specific human comforts — a Tengese banquet, perhaps, or a concert by Sijanese musicians. 
At [[Essence]] 3, the Exalt may bargain for a retainer’s attendance every night for a month. This increases to one season at [[Essence]] 4, and one year at [[Essence]] 5. Alternatively, she may bargain for a group of retainers — equivalent to a battle group of [[Size]] 1 and [[Might]] 2 — at [[Essence]] 3, increasing to [[Size]] 2 at [[Essence]] 4, and [[Size]] 3 at [[Essence]] 5. The Exalt suffers a cumulative −2 penalty to the bargain roll for each increase in size or duration. An extended or expanded bargain adds a surcharge of one [[Willpower]].
# Bargaining with the Tenebrous Prince
#advice/storyteller
Sooner or later, Asphodel’s wielder will have Shou Ren eating out of the palm of her hand. That’s okay.
The point of bargaining isn’t to make it hard to call upon the sorcerer-prince for aid, but rather to provide plot hooks. Use his requests — and pick and choose among the player’s counteroffers — to steer the game toward interesting locations, characters, and stories. Shou Ren uses [[Willpower]] to reject intimidation, unreasonable persuasion, and manipulation of his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. If pressured, he can and will cut off contact with the wielder for days at a time to regain [[Willpower]] — or simply to emphasize that he will abide no discourtesy. The Storyteller determines the size of Shou Ren’s household and retinue. Destroyed retainers are gone forever, the household diminished until restocked using [[Shadow-World Snare]].
