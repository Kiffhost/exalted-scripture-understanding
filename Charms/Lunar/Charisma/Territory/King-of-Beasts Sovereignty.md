Untamed Soul Unity The Lunar rules over human and beast alike, maintaining peace between her subjects. Within a locale enchanted by Moon-and-Earth Blessing, she forges a bond between all animals of a single species and the mortal inhabitants. After a day in the wilderness, she rolls (Charisma + [Performance,Presence,orSurvival])against(thespecies’ Resolve + 2), or (the species’ Resolve + 3) if they qualify as two-dot familiars (Exalted, p. 161). Animals that qualify as three-dot familiars can’t be affected. If successful, all animals of that species form a Minor Tie of loyalty toward the region’s mortal inhabitants, or a Major Tie if used within a territory claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation. So long as they’re treated respectfully, they’ll offer protection, labor, and companionship to humans. They return to the wilderness at story’s end, though individuals may remain, based on their interactions. Even those that leave won’t directly harm mortal natives unless provoked.
