*The Sidereal’s blade is still as untroubled waters, waiting patiently for a perfect opportunity to strike.*
To use this Charm, the Sidereal must be aiming at an enemy whose Initiative is at least 10 lower than hers.
She makes a withering or decisive attack against him.
She doubles her attack roll extra successes to determine a withering attack’s raw damage or adds them as dice of decisive damage.
Alternatively, when the Sidereal clashes or counterattacks, she can use this as a Supplemental Charm to enhance them, as above. If she benefits from a full defense, she doesn’t need to be aiming to do so.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating an enemy with an attack that benefited from aiming or a counterattack or clash while using a full defense.
