*The Abyssal’s perception transcends the prison of the world, casting her gaze upon all that she must one day destroy.*
The Abyssal casts her perception out from afar. She may choose a specific location — a manse, a small village, a city district — within ([[Essence]] x5) miles, letting her observe it as with [[All-Seeing Overlord’s Lair]]. This doesn’t let her perceive anything beyond the observed area’s boundaries.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can choose an individual, object, or other specific thing, like “my nemesis, Panther,” “my daiklave,” or “the intruders in my lair.” If a qualifying target is within ([[Essence]]) miles, she can observe its immediate surroundings. If there are multiple targets that fit the Abyssal’s description, she can pay a ten-mote surcharge to observe up to ([[Essence]] + [[Perception]]) of them. She can only observe one at a time, requiring a miscellaneous action to switch between viewpoints.
Anyone observed with this Charm feels a faint unease, as if being watched by something malevolent. If the Abyssal seeks out a specific individual, she can heighten this, letting her make a ([[Manipulation]] + [[Awareness]]) threaten roll against him. This Charm’s range is doubled while using [[All-Seeing Overlord’s Lair]], or while all five of the Abyssal’s senses are currently enhanced with Inhuman Perfection of (Sense).
With an [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay twenty-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to waive this Charm’s range limit once per story. She can even peer even into other realms of existence.
## Reset 
If the Abyssal fails an [[Awareness]] roll against a target of her observations, she can’t use this Charm against him again for the rest of the session.
