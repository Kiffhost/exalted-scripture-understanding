Contemplating the materials and components in her workshop, the Lunar understands how they might be worked and assembled, seeing the swiftest route to completion. She undertakes a basic or major project with any Attribute, dramatically accelerating its pace. If she has all tools and materials needed, she can complete most projects in minutes. The most arduous, work-intensive projects can be completed in an hour if basic, or a day if major. With [[Intelligence]] 4, the silver point cost of rolling to complete a major project (Exalted, p. 241) is reduced by ([[Essence]]) points.
