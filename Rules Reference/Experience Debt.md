Certain [[Charms]] let a player character increase or gain new traits by incurring experience debt equal to the normal cost of purchasing those traits. Any experience points she subsequently receives go toward paying off the debt, until it’s paid in full. An Exalt’s player may choose to pay off a debt solely with Lunar Experience, Abyssal Experience, Solar Experience, or similar if she could spend it on that trait. Until the debt is fully paid, the character can’t benefit from other effects that cause experience debt. [[Storyteller]] characters never go into experience debt, but can’t benefit from such effects more than once per story.
