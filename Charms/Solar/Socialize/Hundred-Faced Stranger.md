This Charm permanently upgrades all purchases of HeartEclipsing Shroud, allowing the player to assign Abilities and specialties to each persona with the following rules: •	 Assign the persona’s favored Abilities—ten which can be placed anywhere. •	Count the Solar’s dots in Integrity or Presence, Bureaucracy or Linguistics, Ride or Sail, Socialize, and one Dawn Caste Ability. This is the number of Ability dots the player may assign to the persona’s character sheet. The persona cannot have a Craft, Lore, Occult or a Dawn Caste Ability rated higher than the Solar’s own, and may not have a higher number of total dots spread across Dawn Abilities than the Solar has. At least half the dots (rounded up) must go into Eclipse or Zenith Abilities. •	HalvetheSolar’stotalexperience(rounddown)andgrant this as bonus experience to the persona. This experience cannot be used to change the persona’s Attributes, increase her Willpower or purchase Charms or Merits, but can be used to upgrade Abilities using favored and nonfavored prices. Where the persona shares Abilities with theSolar,itautomaticallyknowsCharmstheSolaralready knows. With the exception of Craft, Lore, and Occult it may also learn Abilities the Exalt does not herself know. •	 Assign specialties: three that line up with the persona’s concept. Additional specialties cost three experience points each. Please note: The Solar inherits these traits upon using the prerequisites to change personas. The first time a Solar undertakes this transition, she does not automatically possess all of the allotted Abilities afforded by this Charm. Immediately after creation, the persona only has access to those traits it shares with the Solar. All other Abilities and specialties must be acquired by spending the normal amount of training time learning them while wearing the persona’s guise. Any outstanding dots in requisite Zenith and Eclipse Abilities must be trained first. Naturally this requires that the Solar spend a considerable amount of time as her alternate self. Once a persona becomes active, it grows along with the Solar, gaining one experience point for every two the Solar accrues. Experience points gained while in the guise of the persona contribute their full amount to the Solar’s experience total, not the persona’s.
