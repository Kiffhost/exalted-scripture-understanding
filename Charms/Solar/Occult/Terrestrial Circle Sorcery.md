*The Solar steps through the First Circle and is forever transformed.*
Upon learning this Charm, the Exalt gains the ability to learn and cast spells from the Terrestrial Circle of [[sorcery]]. In addition, the Solar learns one shaping ritual (p. 466) and one Terrestrial spell for free. The spell selected becomes the sorcerer’s “control spell,” and may feature in the anima iconography and be referenced in the mechanics of certain [[Charms]].

Also gain [[Thaumaturgist]] at no cost.
