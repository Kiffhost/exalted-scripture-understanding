The sorcerer channels Essence through esoteric formulae and rigorously-practiced mudras. Once per scene, when she stunts the first shape sorcery roll of a spell with invocations or mudras, she gains (stunt rating + 2) sorcerous motes towards completing the spell. Enhancing her control spell doesnâ€™t count against this once-per-scene limit.
