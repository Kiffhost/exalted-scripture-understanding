The Lunar shrinks even the most colossal forms to a grass-blade’s size. She may use Emerald Grasshopper Form to grant her current shape Minuscule Size, instead of changing into a different form. Clothing and moonsilver artifacts rescale with her for this Charm’s duration, while equipment incompatible with her reduced size is banished Elsewhere. Minuscule Size confers the following: 
-  She adds +3 Evasion against attacks by larger foes, or +2 Evasion against enemies with the Tiny Creature Merit. This counts as a Charm bonus. 
-  Larger characters subtract three successes from Awareness-based rolls to notice her, or two successes if they have the Tiny Creature Merit. 
-  Against enemies without Minuscule Size, the base damage of her withering attacks can’t exceed (Strength) before adding attack roll extra successes or dice from Charms. 
-  Against enemies without Minuscule Size, her decisive attacks don’t deal damage, but can still convey poison and similar maladies. 
-  She can’t grapple characters without Minuscule Size or oppose the control rolls of grapples made by such characters. 
-  She’s treated as having Strength 1 to determine what feats of strength she can attempt, and must use Charms to raise her effective rating in order to undertake a feat. 
-  If her form has the Tiny Creature or Legendary Size Merits, their effects are suppressed. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Minuscule Size may learn this as a Wits Charm.
