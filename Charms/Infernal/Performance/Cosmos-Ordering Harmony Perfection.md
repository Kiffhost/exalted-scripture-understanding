*The Infernal has attained a perfection beyond what this imperfect world can bear, a beauty to make even the Yozis weep.*

The Infernal waives the cost of all Performance Charms used for a single influence roll or performance.
## Reset
Once per day, unless reset by upholding a Defining Intimacy with a performance or by swaying large audiences with social influence. It doesn’t reset if the Infernal has malevolent intentions or purposefully tries to harm someone — it must be free of malice.
## [[Keys]]
#### Shattered World Refrain
Once per day, the Infernal can reset this Charm if she takes decisive damage or is crashed while performing.
