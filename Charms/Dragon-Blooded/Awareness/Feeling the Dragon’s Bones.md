The Dragon-Blood extends her senses through the earth, constructing an accurate image of her surroundings from vibrations. The Dragon-Blood rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) to sense characters and objects out to medium range, even things that are behind walls or underground. A single success is sufficient both to hear and to visualize a black-and-white image of anything that is moving or creating vibrations, such as a person walking or an underground spring’s water. In underground locales or structures made entirely of stone, this extends to long range. In Earth Aura, the Dragon-Blood may commit this Charm’s mote cost for as long as she remains in Aura state. Doing so waives the mote cost of AllEncompassing Earth Sense.
