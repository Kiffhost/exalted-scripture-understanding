The Exalted are often driven by their desires, inflamed by passions that span the centuries. Many Chosen while away the years in pursuit of torrid love affairs and whirlwind romances. With some of the Chosen, seduction is an art form, and with others it’s an instinct. In the social influence system, seduction can be accomplished a number of ways. The seducer might rely on the instill action—through suggestion, innuendo or poesy, she plants a seed of interest in the mind of her love interest. She may then use the persuade action, insinuating herself into the comforts of her target. Others may find it easier to simply attract interest at social gatherings, through seductive gestures or facial expressions, perhaps accentuating their most provocative clothing or their favorite features in order to draw attention. In these and many other cases, the character need not use the instill action, and if a persuade action is required, it can often be perfunctory—characters who respond to such signals are usually eager to explore their significance. Generally, when the seducer’s target is already interested in sex, no roll is needed. Seduction can also be accomplished through the bargain action, in a roundabout way. The Empress herself once wrote of her frustrating attraction to the “boorish” Brem Marst, whose wealth drew her as surely as his handsome brow.
