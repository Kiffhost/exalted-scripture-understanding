The Dragon-Blood vanishes into her performance, receding from her audienceâ€™s notice. She rolls (Manipulation + Performance). As long as she continues to perform, characters whose Resolve is beaten by her roll cannot directly notice her. While they see or hear her artistic display, they pay no mind to the person performing it. The Dragon-Blood can take other actions while continuing the performance by flurrying them with a miscellaneous action to continue performing, but this Charm ends if the Dragon-Blood stops performing, rolls Join Battle, or takes an overt action that draws notice to herself, such as brandishing a weapon.
