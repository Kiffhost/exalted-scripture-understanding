*The Abyssal transcends speed and distance — she is the darkness that precedes light, the death at the end of all life.*
The Abyssal automatically succeeds on a rush or an opposed [[Athletics]] roll in a test of speed. On extended actions, she counts as having rolled one more success than her opponent, if her own roll isn’t higher.
If multiple characters use an effect like this Charm, such as Solars’ [[Living Wind Approach]], each receives a result of one success more than the highest number of successes on any one roll.
