The proper place for one who has wronged the Exalt is on the ground, groveling. This Evocation may be used at Initiative 10+ to supplement an attack against an offender or one of his minions. If the attack succeeds, the target is knocked prone. The Exalt may then target him with a reflexivesocialaction—eithertointimidate;toinspireshame, guilt, or remorse; or to read intentions to assess penitence. 

## Resonant

If the wielder’s social action succeeds, one point of Initiative is stolen from her enemy and added to her own.
