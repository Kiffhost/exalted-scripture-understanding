*Death’s Lawgiver commands the lost and the damned to crew her dreaded vessel.*
Ships claimed with Dread Captain’s Command become vessels of the dead. Ghostly sailors can perform any duties involving the ship even while dematerialized, although they can’t attack material characters or take other physical actions to interact with the material world. While performing these duties, such ghosts can be seen and heard by material characters, making exchanges of social influence possible. In the Underworld, the Abyssal adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on Sail rolls while aboard a ship crewed by the undead.
With Sail 5, Essence 2, mortals who die aboard the claimed ship are reanimated as zombies (Exalted, p.
502) that obey the Abyssal unthinkingly. If a mortal had a Seafaring dice pool or similar, his zombie keeps it, up to a maximum of eight dice. Otherwise, such zombies gain a Seafaring pool of three dice. However, such zombies fall apart if they step foot off ship as if they’d suffered years of decay at the ocean’s depth in a matter of seconds.
### Whispers
While piloting the ship, the Abyssal may invoke her Whispers to materialize her ghostly crew for one scene. They pay no cost to do so.
