Certain Charms like Joint-Wounding Attack donâ€™t make sense when applied to a battle group. Instead of having a single dagger knock the eye out of ten thousand people, refer to the Orichalcum Rule on page 182. In addition, the Storyteller may elect a single target to take the strike instead of the battle group, assigning that character an amount of Initiative, combat skill, and weaponry appropriate to the drama at hand. If this character is crashed or given wound penalties that makes it a negligible threat, it recedes back into the swell of the battle group and can no longer be targeted.
