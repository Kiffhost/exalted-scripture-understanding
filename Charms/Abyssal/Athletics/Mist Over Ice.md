*Lightening her body with Essence, the Abyssal’s tread becomes as insubstantial as a ghost’s.*
While running, the Abyssal can move over unstable surfaces, even water. She never risks damaging or breaking thin or flimsy surfaces and isn’t affected by environmental hazards whose surface she runs over. This Charm remains active for as long as she continues to run.
With Athletics 5, Essence 2, the Abyssal can activate this Charm with instant duration, letting her safely pause on an unstable surface for long enough to complete a single action. However, this doesn’t grant any protection against environmental hazards.
