The Exalt draws upon her own momentum to bend and flow with opposing forces. For every two Initiative spent in response to an attack, the player may raise the Exaltâ€™s Evasion by one. Reed in the Wind raises the cap on how much the Solar can enhance her Evasion by her Essence. At Dodge 5+, Essence 3+, a successful dodge with Reed in the Wind restores one mote. This bonus may only occur once per round.
