When a Sidereal uses an Ascending (Caste) Horoscope or Descending (Caste) Horoscope on a Storyteller character, the Storyteller doesn’t need to meticulously track everything that character does off-screen — instead, she can portray the blessing or curse’s effects narratively, as with prophecies (p. 143). Cursing a scavenger prince seeking to plunder the same ruins as a rival with Descending Journeys Horoscope might delay him reaching the ruins, causing him to get there at the same time as or after his rival. It might also cause him to reach his journey’s end much worse for the wear than normally.
