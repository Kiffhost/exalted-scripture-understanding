*The necromancer sews a corpse-monstrosity together to send into war, stitched together or bonded through rivets and grafts of soulsteel and dark iron.*
This spell requires sufficient materials: animal or human corpses, significant quantities of bone, soulsteel, or other metals often mined in shadowlands or the Underworld, and similar necromantic wonders.
After at least a week of work, the necromancer rolls (Intelligence + {Craft or Medicine}) against difficulty 7.
The difficulty is reduced by one for each of the following criteria she meets
- She has a workforce of skilled assistants.
- She has ample materials and resources.
- She spends at least a month preparing her creation.
- The corpse-engine lacks Legendary Size.
Success allows the necromancer to animate a titanic corpse-engine of the walking dead: centipedal siege ladders known as spine chains; hundred-handed brachial sapping arrays, able to dig tunnels beneath the earth and tear mortals apart with their many grasping limbs; and towering thousand-corpse goliaths, giants composed of armor and moaning corpses able to shatter city walls and wrestle warstriders to the earth. The corpse-engine possesses a Defining Tie of obedience to the necromancer, which cannot be altered by any means.
On a failure, the necromancer is still able to reanimate her corpse-engine, but with one of the following drawbacks
- It may go berserk in battle, causing greater destruction than intended or disobeying orders at inconvenient times. An unrolled Shape Necromancy action at short range may be required to regain control over it.
- It needs regular maintenance as its corpseparts rot or weaken. These require weekly (Intelligence + Medicine) rolls against difficulty 7, with the difficulty reduced by one each for a workforce of skilled assistants or ample materials and resources. Failure increases its wound penalty by one until the next time the necromancer succeeds on this roll.
- It lacks an animating intelligence, requiring a ghost with Nemissary’s Ride or a similar effect to possess and direct it.
- Other quirks requiring maintenance or supervision of the Storyteller’s devising.
Treat any such quirks as a Flaw (Exalted, p. 167) if the necromancer is meaningfully inconvenienced by them.
If the necromancer has dots in a Craft that involves preparing or using dead flesh, like embalming, taxidermy, tanning, or cooking, she receives craft points for meeting objectives as per a major project or a basic project if she failed (Exalted, pp. 240–241).
## Control
The necromancer may assemble her corpse-engine through will alone, tendrils of darkness assembling the monstrosity from its constituent parts.
She always counts as having sufficient assistants to reduce the difficulty of rolls and can make them with Occult. She may reestablish control over berserk corpse-engines at medium range and may have similar benefits in mitigating other quirks.
## Distortion (15)
The distorting necromancer must be standing within short range of the corpse-engine.
Success inflicts a flaw as if the necromancer had failed on her roll to animate it.
