*Wreathed in the primeval fear of death, the Abyssal surpasses her victim’s worst nightmares.*
When the Abyssal makes a [[threaten]] roll, she can leverage her target’s strongest [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear as though she were its object. She doesn’t have to know what this [[Intimacy]] is, nor does she learn it.
If she’s already the object of her target’s strongest [[Intimacy]] of fear (or tied for it), she instead adds non-Charm dice equal to the intensity of the target’s next-strongest [[Intimacy]] of fear and the cost to resist increases by one [[Willpower]] .
If the Abyssal’s target has no [[Intimacy|Tie]]s of fear, she’s refunded this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost.
