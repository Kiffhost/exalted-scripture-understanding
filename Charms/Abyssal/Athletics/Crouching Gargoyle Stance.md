*The Abyssal draws on her unsurpassed speed and incomparable balance to move in defiance of gravity, scuttling up walls or loping along ramparts.*
The Abyssal can move up or down sheer vertical surfaces like walls or move upside down on horizontal surfaces like ceilings. If she ends this Charm’s duration while somewhere she couldn’t normally stand and doesn’t renew it, she falls as usual.
