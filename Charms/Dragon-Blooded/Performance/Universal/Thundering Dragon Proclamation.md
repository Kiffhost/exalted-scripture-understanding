Breathing deep of the world, the Dragon-Blood raises her voice to a resounding shout, her words rumbling across the sky like thunder. Her voice is loud enough to be heard clearly by characters at extreme range, up to four bands away from her. The influence she can take through her amplified voice is limited to inspire and threaten actions, but she ignores environmental or distance penalties. She doubles 9s on all voice-based [[Performance]] rolls, as well as command actions (Exalted, p. 209). She may lower her voice to normal volume, and must do so to engage in non-[[Performance]] forms of social influence, but doesnâ€™t benefit from doubles 9s when she does. This Charm can only be used once per day.
