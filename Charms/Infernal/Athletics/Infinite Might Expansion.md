*The Infernal’s strength knows no limits, bearing up mountains like a child picking up a pebble.*

The Infernal can attempt a feat of strength beyond her size and leverage, punching a giant hole in a temple’s walls, tearing a building from its foundations, or diverting Isidoros’ passage around her favorite teashop. She adds (Strength/2, rounded up) range bands to the maximum size of what she can lift or how large a portion of a large object or structure she can demolish. If the feat upholds a Major or Defining Intimacy, this increases to (Strength) bands.

With Essence 5, the Infernal can attempt feats regardless of their Strength minimum.
