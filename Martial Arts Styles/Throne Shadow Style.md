# [[Throne Shadow Style]]
Throne Shadow style is the fighting art of the éminence grise who lurks behind queens and princes, moving unnoticed as all eyes watch the crown. Its practitioners master the ways of insight, subtlety, and misdirection; they’re sometimes called viziers, for while they’re skilled in hand-to-hand combat, their greatest strength is their students and disciples. When the vizier feints, her student strikes; when she moves back, he advances.
Many Sidereals practice Throne Shadow style, befitting those who shape the course of history unseen, but they’re far from its only masters. Few schools are wholly devoted to it, but some schools of other styles incorporate it as a set of advanced techniques that must be mastered to be recognized as a teacher of martial arts. On thistle-wreathed Mount Kenoi, courtiers and royal consorts study Throne Shadow to survive the autokrator’s deadly court. The Celadon Lowlands’ peasant farmers have practiced it for generations, the legacy of a wandering Sidereal who fought alongside them in a long-ago rebellion.  
## Weapons
Throne Shadow unarmed attacks are primarily open palm strikes, pushes, and low kicks, though stylists make use of their forearms, elbows, and knees as well. It’s also compatible with [[Fighting Chain|fighting chains]], [[Rope Dart|rope darts]], [[Seven-Section Staff|seven-section staffs]], [[Staff|staffs]], and wind-and-fire wheels.
