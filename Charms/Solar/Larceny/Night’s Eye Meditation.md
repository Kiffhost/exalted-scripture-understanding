The Solar is a master of deception, and is aware of any challenge to her position. Each time a character attempts to counter a Larceny based action or disguise with Investigation or Larceny, the Lawgiver may use this Charm to add 10s on her opponentsâ€™ attempts to her own results for one turn. This retroactively makes her disguises harder to pierce and actively makes her sleight-of-hand and pickpocketing harder to notice.
