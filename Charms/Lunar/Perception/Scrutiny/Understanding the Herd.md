*A person carries his people’s scent in his blood; no matter his travels, his homeland flows through his veins.*
A successful read intentions or profile character roll reveals what culture the target belongs to, in addition to the normal information, as well as any [[Intimacy|Tie]] he possesses to that culture. If he’s disguised as a member of another culture, the Lunar receives a result consistent with the disguise unless her successes also exceed his disguise successes. If the Lunar is unfamiliar with the revealed culture, the Storyteller should provide a useful piece of information, e.g., “he belongs to a nomadic society that follows the migrations of mammoth herds.” Alternatively, if the Storyteller hasn’t worked out the culture’s details, the Lunar’s player may detail them as though [[introducing a fact]] with her original roll. With a [[Perception]] 3, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, once the Lunar uncovers what culture a character belongs to, she can subsequently use this Charm to determine his position within it. Success reveals his social, political, and economic standing, as well as the nature of any position he holds within the culture. If other characters present in the scene hold authority over her target within that culture, or if he holds authority over them, she discerns these relationships, as well as any Ties her target holds to those characters.
