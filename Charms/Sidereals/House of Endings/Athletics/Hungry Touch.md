*The Sidereal consumes an object’s future, bringing about its inevitable destruction early.*
The Sidereal performs a feat of demolition simply by touching an object. Lengthy feats, like bashing through a thick stone wall, are completed instantly if the Storyteller deems it feasible; if not, the time required to complete it is divided by the Sidereal’s (Strength + Athletics). In combat, a successful feat awards one Initiative if the feat changes the scene in the Sidereal’s favor. This Charm can’t be used to destroy objects worn or wielded by enemies.
With an Athletics 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm against an object held or carried by someone. (It can’t be used against armor). This requires a difficulty 4 unarmed gambit. Mundane objects are destroyed by a successful gambit. Against artifacts and similarly durable items, the Sidereal reflexively rolls a feat of demolition. A single success breaks its wielder’s attunement, while (5 + Artifact rating; 15 for Artifact N/As) renders it nonfunctional until repaired (Exalted, p. 242). This can’t affect items that exist because of ongoing magic, like Glorious Solar Saber.
A third purchase lets the Sidereal use this Charm against armor for a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, as above.
