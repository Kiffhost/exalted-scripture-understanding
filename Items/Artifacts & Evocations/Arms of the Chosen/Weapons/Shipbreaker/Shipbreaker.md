*Long ago, the undersea nations of the West formed the Niobraran League to oppose the Exalted Host.*
Ianthe of Nengur Deep — a Solar warrior-artisan of the sea peoples — sided with the Niobrarans, seeing herself as seaborn first and Solar second. Descending to the abysses where prehuman spirits dwell, she incorporated their arts in forging [[Shipbreaker]], a mighty weapon against the Exalted fleets. Together, she and [[Shipbreaker]] sent many a warship spiraling down into the depths. Even as the tide turned against the Niobraran League, Ianthe remained loyal to the sea peoples. But when a Lunar emissary offered clemency not merely for herself but for all of Nengur Deep, what could she do but comply? She surrendered military secrets to the Exalted host, then led her own people in ambush against the Niobraran reserve at the Battle of Saffron Wave, breaking the back of the oceanic forces. When Ianthe perished in the last days of the Niobraran conflict, [[Shipbreaker]] was taken up by Dragon-Blooded heroes of the Western seas, whose descendants employed it to hunt down Solar survivors after the Usurpation. Wielded after the Contagion by the Exigent god-admirals of Cabochon, the weapon has since fallen to the Lintha Family, whose demon-blooded captains employ it to terrible effect. A black jade [[siege crossbow]], Shipbreaker’s fittings and string are of orichalcum. Orichalcum inlay on the stock depicts a kraken crushing ships in its coils and drawing them beneath the waves. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Shipbreaker]]

[[Shipbreaker]] takes no penalties for being fired into or out of water. If a water-aspected hearthstone is set in one of its slots, it allows its wielder to breathe underwater and pulls her along through the water, allowing her to swim freely while wielding it.
