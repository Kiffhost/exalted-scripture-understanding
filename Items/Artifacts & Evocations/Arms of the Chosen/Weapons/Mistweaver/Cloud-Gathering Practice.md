Weaving mist has become second nature to the wielder. Upon winning Join Battle, she can reflexively activate Fog-Raising Gesture at no cost. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with jade, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she upholds a Major or Defining Intimacy by defeating a non-trivial foe within the mists conjured by the daiklave.
