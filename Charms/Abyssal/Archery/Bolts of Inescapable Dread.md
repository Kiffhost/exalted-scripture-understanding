*Loosing an artful warning shot, the Abyssal destroys her foe’s hopes of escape.*
The Abyssal fires a warning shot, a difficulty 1 gambit rolled against the lower of an enemy’s [[Defense]] or [[Resolve]]. Enemies suffer −2 [[Resolve]] if their [[Initiative]] is lower than the Abyssal’s or they can’t perceive her.
If the gambit succeeds, the Abyssal’s terrified victim suffers a −1 penalty on all rolls for the rest of the scene, which increases to penalty of the (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3) on disengage and [[Awareness]] rolls. While within short range of the Abyssal, he also suffers −2 Evasion and [[Resolve]].
If the victim crashes the Abyssal or deals 3+ decisive damage to her with an attack, he may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist this effect.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can use this Charm reflexively on her first turn in combat, and it doesn’t count as her attack for the round. If she wins [[Join Battle]], she can use this Charm immediately, making a gambit against any number of enemies who see the shot. She makes a single [[Initiative]] roll, adding +1 difficulty for each nontrivial enemy past the first, maximum 4.
