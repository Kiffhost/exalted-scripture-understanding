*The Sidereal conceals her true place under the Sorcerer’s auspices and in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], hiding her Exalted nature behind counterfeit divinity.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
- The Celestial Bureaucracy’s records list her as a god with a purview too insignificant to draw scrutiny or suspicion. (She can use the same purview across multiple uses of this Charm). Under this false identity, she counts as wearing a resplendent destiny. 
- She counts as a spirit if it’s advantageous to her. This doesn’t let her dematerialize or use spirit [[Charms]]. 
- If she disguises herself appropriately, opposing rolls fail automatically unless enhanced by magic; even then, they suffer +1 target number. She can manifest appropriate supernatural sensory displays. Magic that reveals her nature shows her as a god of that purview, even when not disguised. 
- She can hear prayers directed to her (including those to her cover identities or disguises). Discerning useful information from this requires a ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) roll at difficulty ([[Cult]]). The difficulty can vary based on factors like how many people make the same prayer, praying at a shrine to the Sidereal or her cover identity, etc.
