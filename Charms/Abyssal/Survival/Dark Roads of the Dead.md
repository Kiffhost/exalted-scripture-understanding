*The secret roads of the Underworld reveal themselves to Death’s Lawgiver.*
The Abyssal rolls ({Perception or Intelligence} + Survival) with double 9s to discover or recall the presence of a pathway between Creation and the Underworld. She doubles 8s if she uses this Charm in the Underworld or on a moonless night in Creation.
The difficulty is 3 by default, but the Storyteller may adjust it based on the deathknight’s familiarity with the local area on both sides of the veil.
If successful, the Storyteller reveals a path that will take a few days’ travel on foot. The Abyssal’s extra successes may shorten this journey:
EXTRA SUCCESSES DISTANCE 1–2 One day 3–4 A few hours 5–6 A few minutes 7+ None — the path is at the Abyssal’s current The Storyteller determines the exact form the pathway between worlds takes. While it can be a shadowland, there are many secret paths the Abyssals might walk.
These roads are fleeting, rarely allowing for repeat or return use, unlike shadowlands. While traveling along them, the Abyssal may encounter ghosts of the newly dead, who may be confused, lost, or afraid on their path to the Underworld. The Storyteller also determines exactly where in the Underworld or Creation it leads to, though it’s typically in approximately the same geographic location as the corresponding point on the other side.
With Survival 5, Essence 3, the Abyssal can seek a path unconstrained by any semblance of geography, tracing the symbolic resonances of the ### Underworld
she might travel from a city in the far North to an ancestral abode in Stygia or from the slums of Nexus to a debtor’s afterlife. She halves her successes when determining how long such a journey takes.
