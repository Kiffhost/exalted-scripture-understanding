The Sidereal sways public opinion to her cause’s side, revealing her opposition’s iniquities. To use this Charm, the Sidereal must be using Worthy Cause Demonstration, unless she’s actually a member of the group she’s representing. After a few hours or days spent advocating for the group she represents, participating in public events put on by them, or suffering public persecution, she may pay five motes, one Willpower to make a special (Charisma + Serenity Ability) instill roll against all characters who interacted with her during this time. Success instills a Major Tie of sympathy to the Sidereal’s group and a Major Tie of condemnation toward the other. When the Sidereal uses Worthy Cause Demonstration while interacting with affected characters, these count as one step higher. Voluntarily eroding one of these Intimacies costs three Willpower per step. If both are fully eroded, the character’s freed from this effect. While this Charm is active, the Sidereal waives Worthy Cause Demonstration’s Willpower cost when using it for the same group.
