*The Lawgiver’s knowledge of the past and her understanding of physical laws allows her to make nigh-flawless general predictions.*
To use this Charm, the Exalt must spend a day studying a subject from an authoritative or definitive source. Her player may then make a pronouncement against an ongoing project based on knowledge her studies reveal, creating bonuses for those who act in accordance with her accurate predictions, and penalties for those who go against them.
Once the Solar has made a prediction, it may not be canceled with a conflicting use of this or similar Charms, though it may be counteracted with Sidereal Astrology or similar powerful fate-bending magic. Though this Charm has an instant duration, the motes spent activating it are committed until the Exalt has had a full night’s rest.
# Example
For example, after reading about the patterns of weather, hostile elemental activity and famine in Jiara during the summer months over the last thousand years, she predicts that Mnemon will not attack Jiaran rebels until fall at the earliest, and will instead spend the summer months consolidating her forces while conserving water and gathering resources for a winter campaign. 
If Mnemon enacts a project to consolidate her forces while gathering resources until winter, the Storyteller should consider Mnemon’s project vastly more successful and easier to complete than otherwise. If Mnemon instead decides to invade Jiaran rebel territory in the summer, her invasion will be met with project difficulties, such as resource shortages, elemental attacks, inclement weather, and more specifically, mechanical penalties to the first [[War]] rolls her generals make in the conflict. Conversely, if Mnemon harbors her forces and the Jiaran rebels instead try to attack her, it is their commanders who will suffer penalties to their opening [[War]] rolls.
