A Solar who has used the prerequisite to increase her Strength to the limit is sufficiently strong enough to hurl a human-sized ally forward or up one range band. This Charm uses the Solar’s own movement action for the round. If the Solar has learned Power Suffusing Form Technique (see Exalted, p. 266), she can combine that Charm with this to hurl an ally the size of a horse and rider safely up or forward one range band, or she may toss a human-sized ally forward two range bands. This use adds one Willpower to the cost of this Charm, but drops the mote cost to two.

### On Strength-Hying Heave

The backer wanted something like the “Fastball Special” from Claremont’s run on the Uncanny X-Men, where Colossus hurls Wolverine at a target. I figured, why not let someone with superhuman strength throw a very heavy ally as well? I can already see a player writing in to tell me how their Zenith stood at the end of a dock as the Night rode up on an armored destrier, and they hurled horse and rider onto the deck of a retreating ship. That said, a Solar using Nine Aeons Thew and other Charms might be able to throw an ally three or more range bands, but they will take falling damage unless they have Charms such as Soaring Crane Leap that will help them land safely. This is a good example of how Solar Charms can and do work together in ways that aren’t expressly outlined in the rules. Backer: Mike Gill
