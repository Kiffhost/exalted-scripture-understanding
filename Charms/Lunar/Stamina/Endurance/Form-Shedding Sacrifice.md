The Lunar sacrifices stolen skins that she might live. She can take a crippling injury by sacrificing her current form instead of suffering maiming. She reverts to her true human shape and permanently loses the sacrificed shape, negating (Essence, maximum 5) levels of damage. She can’t sacrifice her spirit shape or true human shape. The Lunar may use False Death Technique reflexively when she uses this Charm, creating a false corpse of the lost shape, or some portion of a Legendary Size shape, letting her reflexively roll to go to ground (Exalted, p. 204).
