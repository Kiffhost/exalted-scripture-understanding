*A battlefield anointed by the Scar’s acid becomes a caustic reproach against the foolishness of opposing its wielder.*

The Scar’s wielder pierces the ground, creating a violent spring of acid that grows and spreads. It’s an environmental hazard with difficulty 5 and Damage 3L/round that extends out to short range from the point where she used this Evocation and surges upward to short range above the ground. At the start of each of the wielder’s turns, it extends another range band outward horizontally, maximum long.

Enemies damaged by this hazard suffer the same effects inflicted by Dissolve the Legion. Surroundings and scenery are damaged by corrosion: floors stain before rotting away entirely, tainted soil is rendered incapable of sustaining plant life, and unattended objects are tarnished or corroded. It won’t completely destroy structures unless they’re especially flimsy, but still weakens or damages them. Feats of demolition against mundane objects or structures exposed to the acid receive Scar the Pillar’s benefits. (This stacks with that Evocation if the wielder uses it). This lasts until mended with a repair project.
### Dissonant
The hazard can’t extend beyond short range unless the wielder has Essence 4. Even then, it can’t extend beyond medium.
### Resonant
Once per story, the wielder can unleash a wave of corrosion once the hazard reaches long range, spreading out to one mile. This destroys scenery and kills trivial characters at the Storyteller’s discretion. Any characters significant enough to be tracked individual suffer a single interval of this Evocation’s hazard. The wave taints the land and weakens any structures that survive as above.
