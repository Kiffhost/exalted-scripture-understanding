Drawing incredible resilience and vitality from within, the Lunar takes no notice of lesser attacks. She halves a withering attack’s total damage, rounded down. It can’t reduce her below one Initiative unless her attacker has at least (her current temporary Willpower) more Initiative than her before attacking. This Charm can likewise protect the Lunar from being crashed by other sources of Initiative loss inflicted by enemies, but not those she incurs herself, such as paying Initiative costs. This Charm is incompatible with armor. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Impenetrable Armor, the Lunar adds (Essence + 5) to the amount of Initiative an attacker needs to reduce her below Initiative 1.
