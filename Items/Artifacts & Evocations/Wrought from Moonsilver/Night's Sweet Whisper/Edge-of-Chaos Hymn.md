Even the crumbling borders of reality and the hungry tides of chaos that wait beyond heed the Lunar’s melody. When she uses Harmony-With-Reality Technique (p. XX), she can roll ([Charisma or Wits] + Performance) instead of the normal roll, and can use it outside of claimed territories if it benefits a group she has a positive Defining Tie towards. Once per story, when she upholds a positive Major or Defining Tie to a community by successfully stabilizing the Wyld, she gains three Willpower and loses one Limit.
