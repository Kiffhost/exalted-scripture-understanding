*Baptized in vitriol, the Infernal’s masterworks become treasures worthy of a Green Sun Prince.*

The Infernal tempers an artifact in vitriol or another of the caustic, transformative substances of Hell, turning it into one of the hellish artifact that Infernal Exalted are resonant with. This takes (10 – Essence) hours. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this may alter the artifact’s themes and the nature of the [[Evocations]] that can be awakened from it.

The Infernal can immediately awaken up to (Essence) of the tempered artifact’s [[Evocations]]. She can do so by incurring experience debt (p. XX), spend white points toward the Evocation’s cost as if they were experience, or a combination of the two.

The Infernal can use this Charm on an artifact that’s already been corrupted to awaken a single Evocation, as above.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used on an artifact once per story.
