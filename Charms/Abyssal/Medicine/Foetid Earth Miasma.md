*Burying seven cursed corpses in the earth in a blasphemous ritual, the Abyssal taint’s the land’s [[Essence]] with the spiritual energies of blight and decay.*
The Abyssal taints a region by interring the corpses of seven victims who died at her hand to mark its boundaries. This ritual must be performed at night and takes at least one interrupted hour. The afflicted region can be up to ([[Essence]] x 10) square miles. She blights the region with one of the mundane diseases she can use with [[Unsurpassed Plague Kiss]], inflicting the following effects:
 - Those within the blighted region must roll to resist being infected by the chosen disease each day they spend within it. The [[disease]] can’t be fully cured without magically enhanced treatment, and is unusually contagious, gaining +1 virulence.
 - The spiritual corruption inflict a −3 penalty on [[Stamina]] rolls. This subtracts successes instead of dice from rolls to resist disease.
 - [[Blight]] ravages the land: water takes on a foul, almost fungal quality, and mosquitos proliferate around it; the air grows stale and smells of sickness in enclosed spaces; wood grows punky and rotten far quicker than it should. Mass deaths resulting from disease are far more likely to form a shadowland than usual.
The blight can be nullified by disinterring the bodies and giving them proper funerary rites. Uncovering this vulnerability typically requires [[Lore]] and [[Occult]] rolls or suitable magic — and even then, the bodies must be found, typically requiring use of [[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], or [[Survival]].
