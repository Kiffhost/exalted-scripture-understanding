Feeling her mount’s fury piqued at a rival’s temerity, the Lawgiver is empowered. For each 10 an opponent rolls in an interval of a race (p. 189) or in a rush or disengage action (p. 197), the Solar gains a mote of [[Essence]] which can only be used to fuel [[Ride]] [[Charms]]. Motes generated in this fashion fade if they are not used on the Exalt’s next turn.
