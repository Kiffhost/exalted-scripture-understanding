The Lunar becomes a living mirror of her surroundings, shifting her skin’s color and texture to blend in. She adds ([[Appearance]]) dice on [[Stealth]] rolls and doesn’t need hiding places to enter concealment. Any situational dice her surroundings add on [[Stealth]] rolls become non-Charm successes. Attacking or moving to a different range band suppresses this Charm’s benefits until the end of the next turn in which the Lunar doesn’t attack or change range bands. This Charm ends if the Lunar is hit by an attack. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Camouflage, moving between range bands doesn’t suppress this Charm’s benefit while in that animal’s native environment.
