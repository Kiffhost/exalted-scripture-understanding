The Lunar’s shadow moves independently, weaving [[sorcery]] in her stead as she attends to other matters. She flurries a shape [[sorcery]] action with a nonattack action, reducing the penalty on both rolls by one. If she knows [[Celestial Circle Sorcery]], she ignores all penalties, including the [[Defense]] penalty. An [[Intelligence]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets her extend this Charm’s duration to one scene for a four-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge.
