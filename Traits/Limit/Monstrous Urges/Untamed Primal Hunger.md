Duration: Session or Scene
---
The Lunar’s hunger drowns out all else. Her player chooses a category of living creature — an animal species, all animals whose shapes she lacks, Dynasts, anything currently bleeding, etc. She’s driven to hunt her chosen prey and devour it thoroughly (killing it first is optional). If someone interferes with her hunt, she’ll violently subdue them. She can refrain from harming individuals toward whom she has positive Ties, but a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward a group isn’t sufficient. The Storyteller can veto a choice if it wouldn’t be possible to encounter any creatures falling under it that session.
This ends if a character toward whom the Lunar has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] is harmed because of her insistence in the hunt, or her feeding on prey instead of protecting him. If enough of the chosen prey are in the current scene that devouring them all is narratively engaging, this ends at the end of that scene.
