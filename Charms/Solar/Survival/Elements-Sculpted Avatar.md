The Solar communes with the elements and with the beasts of nature, gaining harmonious elements of both. This Charm requires use of Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit and is completed by a Simple action in which the Lawgiver spends an hour meditating in a place where the elements are strong and fierce, such as the center of a sandstorm or beneath a massive waterfall. Over the course of the hour, the Solar’s physical appearance becomes shaped by the surrounding elements. She gains distinct elemental and / or bestial features, though not the benefits associated with true mutations. This ethereal transformation raises her Appearance by one, even if this raises her Appearance above five. In addition, she gains one non-Charm bonus die to soothe or comfort any elemental, beast, or Lunar Exalted through the use of social influence.

### On Elements-Sculpted Avatar

For those of you who love your Appearance cap-breakers — but only if you are willing to take the side trip into Survival. Also, just a friendly reminder that someone who wants to play a terrifying character with the Hideous Merit can benefit from Appearance magnifying Charms. Just give them a bunch of threatening or strange markings. This voids the Charm’s ability to soothe aforementioned characters, and does not conversely give them a bonus to social influence to horrify such creatures.
