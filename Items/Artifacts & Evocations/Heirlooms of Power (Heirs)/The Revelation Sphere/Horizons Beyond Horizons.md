Visions, waking dreams, and hidden portents reveal Creation’s secrets to the Revelation Sphere’s master. She can make an introduce fact roll regarding the existence or details of a manse, demesne, spirit sanctum, shadowland, Wyld zone, deposit of magical materials, or similar place of power without needing an applicable [[Lore]] background. Any successes added on the roll with [[A Dream of Ancient Ice]] are non-Charm. If she has an applicable [[Lore]] background, a successful roll grants her one [[Willpower]].
This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by successfully navigating to the introduced location and achieving one of the wielder or her allies’ goals.
