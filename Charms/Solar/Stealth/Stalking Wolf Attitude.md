The Solar stalks her prey unseen, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. While concealed, the Solar uses this technique to focus on an opponent. Feeling along the pulse of the world’s Essence, she stalks her target from the shadows, her veins coursing with lethal readiness. With this Charm, the Solar ignores the -3 penalty to Stealth rolls for moving while concealed. In addition, on each round in which she succeeds at the contested roll to evade detection by her mark, she gains an amount of Initiative equal to her extra successes on the roll. When the Exalt senses the perfect moment to strike, she may then leap from concealment to unleash a decisive attack, as long as she’s been hidden by this Charm for at least a round. For each round that she remains under the effects of this Charm, the Solar gains a mounting -1 penalty to her Stealth rolls, and if she is discovered or if she voluntarily leaves concealment or terminates the Charm without making a decisive attack, she loses all of the Initiative she gained through her most recent activation of the Charm.
