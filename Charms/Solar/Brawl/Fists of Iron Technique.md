This Charm allows the Exalt to parry lethal damage with her bare hands.
In addition, her bare-handed decisive strike does lethal damage and her withering damage ignores ([[Essence]] + [[Intimacy]]) soak. The [[Intimacy]] in this context can be a [[Intimacy|Tie]] (as the Solar strikes a hated enemy or defends a beloved friend) or a [[Intimacy|Principle]] (as the Solar exults in the thrill of violence).
