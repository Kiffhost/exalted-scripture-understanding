Shipbreaker channels the raw destructive power of a tidal wave into one or more cumbrous bolts, detonating them in penetrating shockwaves that can tear ships and behemoths apart. The wielder doesn’t need to attack when she uses this Evocation. She chooses a single enemy or ship, rolling (Essence) dice per bolt embedded in that target, each success inflicting one level of Hull damage or two levels of decisive lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. This doesn’t reset her to base Initiative. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by embedding 2+ cumbrous bolts in non-trivial enemies and/or vessels.
