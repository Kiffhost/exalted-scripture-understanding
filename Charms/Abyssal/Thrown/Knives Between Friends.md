*Striking unseen from unexpected angles, the Abyssal sows suspicion of and paranoia.*
The Abyssal misdirects her foes with an attack, requiring them to roll ([[Wits]] + [[Awareness]]) at difficulty ([[Essence]] + 10s on attack roll). 1s on their opposed rolls subtract successes. A character who fails their roll believes the attack came from a completely different angle or direction, rather than from the deathknight.
With [[Thrown]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, if the Abyssal uses this Charm while concealed, she doesnâ€™t lose her concealment against enemies who failed their rolls.
