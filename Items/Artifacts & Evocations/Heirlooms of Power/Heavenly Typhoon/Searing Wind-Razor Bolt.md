Golden lightning trails behind Heavenly Typhoon as the wielder summons a storm to cut down an unjust foe. The wielder makes a decisive attack against a condemned enemy with a lower Initiative, adding the difference between their Initiative ratings in bonus dice to the attack and damage rolls, up to a maximum of (higher of Essence or 3). 

## Resonant

A wielder resonant with jade also knocks her target back one range band if any damage is dealt. OTHER MAGICAL MATERIALS While the Realm’s artificers sometimes incorporate the other magical materials into jade artifacts, an artifact that is made primarily or entirely from another material is considered second-rate, more suited to an outcaste than a Dynast. Their use is accepted but may occasionally draw disparaging remarks from other Dynasts who’ve yet to witness their power.
