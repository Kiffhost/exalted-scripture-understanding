The Lunar oversees traditions that bind peoples together, strengthening societies under her protection. When she leads or participates in a culture’s custom alongside at least one other character who belongs to that culture, she rolls (Charisma + [Performance or Socialize]) against all participating members of that culture to inspire them with pride for their culture. They can’t opt not to assert Resolve against the roll. Each affected character gains a pool of bonus dice equal to the Lunar’s extra successes over his Resolve. These can be added to any social or mental rolls a character makes to protect that culture or achieve its goals. They’re lost if not used within (Lunar’s Essence) days. 
## Protean 

In an animal shape that plays a significant role in the custom invoked or a human shape leading the custom, the Lunar rerolls 5s and 6s until they cease to appear.
