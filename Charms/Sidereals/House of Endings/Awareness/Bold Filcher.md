Spotting the perfect moment for theft, the Sidereal strips away materialistic delusions of selfimportance. The Sidereal adds ([[Perception]]) dice on a pickpocketing roll and can steal in plain sight; her theft can’t be noticed until (her [[Essence]]) minutes have passed or circumstances draw attention to it. If her target has an [[Intimacy]] related to the stolen object — an artisan’s Principle of pride in his handiwork, a merrymaker’s Tie of fondness for strong drink, a warrior’s Tie of respect for his blade — it’s weakened by one step.
