The Solar shoots from her heart; the arrow is part of her. As such, she can sometimes reach out and draw her Essence across an arrow in flight, causing it to flash and flare, surging toward its target like a smite from the sun. This Charm can only be activated on an attack supplemented by Fiery Arrow Attack; when the attack generates at least one 10, this Charm adds one automatic success to the attack, and for each 10 in the attack roll it adds one die to the attack’s raw damage. As the name suggests, Dazzling Flare Attack goes off like a spectacular flare that can be seen for miles—every target using shadows for cover within two range bands must roll Stealth, with a -2 success penalty to the attempt, or be revealed.
