The stylist exudes hostile intent, wreathing her blow in baleful, venomous Essence. Her decisive attack conveys a poison with Damage 3i/round, Duration (higher of Essence or 3) rounds, and a –1 penalty. Her target’s onslaught penalty at the time she attacks him is added to the poison’s base duration. If the stylist enhances a savaging attack, she may expend up to (Strength) rounds of grapple control to increase the poison’s base duration by that many rounds.
