*A spectral chill radiates from the Abyssal, a spiritual emanation of her sense of touch that rimes the world with her icy fingerprints.*
Grasping spectral limbs hang in the air around the Abyssal out to short range, with the following effects:
 - The Abyssal’s sense of touch extends through these phantoms, letting her make touch-based [[Awareness]] rolls within this range without physical contact. She can use [[Charms]] that enhance her sense of touch on any [[Awareness]] rolls made in this range.
 - When a hidden enemy within this range moves and rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) to maintain concealment, he suffers a −2 penalty from the grasping phantoms.
 - When she Joins Battle, she adds three non-Charm dice as she’s aware of at least one concealed enemy in the scene.
If the Abyssal knows Inhuman Perfection of Hearing and Touch, this Charm’s range extends to medium, and she can determine the size, shape, and velocity of anything that moves through this range without needing to roll.
