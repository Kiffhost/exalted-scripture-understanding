*The Abyssal shakes the pillars of Creation until they shatter, burying her foes beneath rubble and corpses.*
The Abyssal makes a reflexive feat of demolition with a forceful blow, adding (Strength) automatic successes. She can spend Initiative instead of motes on the Athletics Excellency or other Athletics Charms she uses on the roll. If successful, the Abyssal completes the feat with a single strike, even if it would normally require an extended period of time. If she fails, she can’t retry that feat until her next round.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can use this Charm after knocking an enemy back with Lashing Tempest Palm or throwing him with Terminal Velocity Approach, treating the falling damage roll as a feat of demolition to destroy whatever her enemy collides with. (The automatic levels of damage inflicted for falling count as automatic successes on the roll). If successful, her victim suffers (feat’s minimum Strength/2, rounded up) additional dice of decisive damage, ignoring Hardness.
