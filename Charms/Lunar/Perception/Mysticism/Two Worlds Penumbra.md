Walking the invisible borders of the spirit realm, the Lunar illumines its denizens with her soul’s fire. As long as her anima level is glowing or higher, dematerialized characters within medium range become visible to all observers, flickering like shadows against her anima’s light. At bonfire, the Lunar’s anima casts them into sharp relief — those within short range are rendered tangible, able to touch and be touched by material characters. A character whose Essence exceeds the Lunar’s may pay one Willpower to become immune to this Charm for one scene. 
## Protean 

If a dematerialized character has a Tie of fear toward the Lunar’s shape, it can’t resist this Charm without entering a Decision Point and invoking an Intimacy of equal or greater intensity.
