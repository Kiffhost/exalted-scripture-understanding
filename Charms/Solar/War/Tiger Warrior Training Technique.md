At the dawn of the world, man knew nothing of the gods save that they were inviolate and could not be vanquished. The Solar Exalted changed that. Through the use of this Charm, even the worst gutter-sweepings and bandits can be trained into an elite fighting force. This Charm enhancestheeffectsofDrill(p.206).TheSolar’strainingregimens are brilliant, ingraining her troops with perfect actions codified from a peerless mind for war. With this Charm, she can train an undisciplined unit up to Average after just a week, and she can instill an Average unit with Elite status after only a month. Any unit which gains Average Drill under the aegis of this training also gains the combat traits of battle-ready soldiers, while any unit raised to Elite Drill gains the combat traits of elite troops (p. 497). In addition, at Essence 3+, the Solar can further enhance an Elite battle group with her transforming will. Demon-Fighting Principle: For 2xp, she can train her elite units to be more effective at fighting ghosts, demons, and other nighted creatures from the haunted tracts of Creation. The battle group gains +2 Might against such foes. Giant-Slaying Tactics: For 2xp, the Exalt’s elite are versed in battle tactics having to do with fighting gigantic opponents. Her forces gain +2 Might against behemoths or other titanic foes. This effect does not stack with DemonFighting Principle. Glory of the Inevitable: The Solar’s Tiger Warriors need no truth but life is death, and death comes on the battlefield. For 3xp, she can instill her elite battle group with perfect morale (p. 210), making it impossible to fail a rout check without powerful magical influence.
