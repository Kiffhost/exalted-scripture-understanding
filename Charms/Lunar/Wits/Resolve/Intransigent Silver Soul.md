No words can tarnish the Lunarâ€™s convictions. She adds (Essence/2, rounded up) non-Charm Resolve against influence that would weaken a Defining Intimacy, or any influence opposed by a Tie to her Solar mate. This Charm can only be used in defense of a given Intimacy once per story, unless reset by upholding that Intimacy through a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).
