*Secrets poison the heart in which they take root.*
The wielder whispers one of her opponent’s secrets to [[Calumny]], and ferments that secret into a deadly poison through a decisive attack. If the wielder’s attack deals damage, the poison takes hold with a duration of (5 + damage dealt) rounds. This secret-poison’s damage/ interval and penalty both correspond to the secret’s potency: 1L/round and −1 for inconvenient; 2L/round and −2 for serious; 3L/round and −3 for life-changing. Characters poisoned by [[Ripened Bitter Fruit]] cannot speak above a whisper until free of the poison. Hearts stopped by this secret-poison grow hard and black, like the stone of a fruit. The secret used to create the venom no longer holds power for Calumny’s [[Evocations]]. This Evocation may be used once per day, unless reset by discovering a life-changing secret. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima cannot reset this Evocation. 

## Dissonant

A character dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation. 

## Resonant

Crashed characters suffer the poison’s entire remaining duration and lethal damage at once, at the end of the round.
