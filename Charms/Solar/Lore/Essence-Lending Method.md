The Lawgiver fortifies her allies with actions as surely as with words. Upon touching a target and paying three motes, the Solar may transfer up to (Essence * 3) motes from her mote pool to her targetâ€™s. In addition, once per scene she may roll Wits + Lore, generating a number of motes equal to her successes and awarding them to her target. If the target cannot accept all the motes transferred by Essence-Lending Method he has until his next action to spend them before they dissipate.
