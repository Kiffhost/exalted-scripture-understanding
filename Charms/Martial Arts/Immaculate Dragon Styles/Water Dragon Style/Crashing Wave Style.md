The Immaculate strikes blow after furious blow, like waves pounding the shore. She makes withering attacks against a single enemy until she misses, crashes him, or has made a total of (1 + his wound penalty) attacks. Against battle groups, she attacks until she misses or depletes the groupâ€™s Magnitude. In Water Aura, crashing an enemy deals dice of lethal damage to him equal to his current onslaught penalty (including the point inflicted by this attack), ignoring Hardness. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack against a crashed enemy and then building up to Initiative 12+.
