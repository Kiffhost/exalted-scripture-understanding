*Madness and damnation are like cloying perfume to the Infernal’s keen senses.*

The Infernal makes an ({Intelligence or Perception} + Occult) roll to discern whether a character suffers from certain psychological and supernatural maladies. She doubles 9s on the roll and adds (Essence) dice. If she has a relevant Occult specialty, she doubles 8s and adds (Essence) successes instead. She can identify all of the following maladies whose difficulty she beats:
- She can identify Psyche effects, Shaping effects, and sorcerous curses at a difficulty equal to the (Essence) of the character who used them. For environmental effects and others effects not used by a character, the Storyteller assigns a difficulty of 1-5 instead.
- She can discern any Derangements a character suffers a difficulty of (4 – their intensity).
- She can uncover a possessing entity at a difficulty of its Guile.

If the Infernal uses what she learns to try to harm, intimidate, or humiliate her target in the same scene, she can waive one point of Willpower from the cost of a Charm that she uses to do so.
