*The Lunar vanishes into her hunting ground’s shadows.*
To use this Charm, she must be in a territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]]. On her next turn, she vanishes, reappearing anywhere in that territory. If she moves or is knocked prone before then, this effect is canceled. With [[Essence]] 4, the Lunar may pay a two-[[Willpower]] surcharge once per story to travel from one territory to another, or to travel to a lair prepared with [[Secure Den Technique]] even if it isn’t in her territory.
