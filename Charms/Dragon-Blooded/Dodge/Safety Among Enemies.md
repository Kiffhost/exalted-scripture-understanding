As the Dragon-Blood spins or swoops around an attack, she twists the wind around the blow to redirect it. Successfully dodging a decisive attack allows her to redirect it to another character within range of the original attack. To do so, her [[Initiative]] must exceed (attacker’s [[Initiative]] + new target’s [[Initiative]]). The attack and all effects enhancing it are then rolled again, using the same dice pool, against its new target.
