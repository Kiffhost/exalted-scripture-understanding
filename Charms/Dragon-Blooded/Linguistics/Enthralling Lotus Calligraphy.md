The Dragon-Blood fashions a trap from beautiful words, weaving a puissant compulsion into every sentence and simile. She makes a written influence roll to instill, persuade, or bargain with a specific character. The written message exerts an unnatural influence upon its intended recipient. Once he’s able to see the document, even if he cannot see the writing, he’s subtly compelled to begin reading it unless he spends (her Essence/2, rounded up) Willpower to break free. This impulse appears natural, and won’t force the victim to endanger himself or abandon pressing tasks. If the target doesn’t resist and begins reading, he must do so long enough to be subjected to whatever influence the document contains. A character who resisted this Charm’s influence with Willpower is immune to this Psyche effect, although he’s still subject to the written influence roll. Enthralling Lotus Calligraphy cannot be used against the same character more than once per story.
