*Even the best-trained warhorse trembles at the perils that the Dragon-Blood faces, but the bond between mount and rider is strong enough to withstand any test.*
She may grant her mount +2 [[Resolve]] against a threaten roll or other fear-based influence, or herself +1 [[Defense]] against an unhorse gambit. In Wood Aura, this Charm lasts as long as the Dragon-Blood remains in Aura, providing both benefits.
