*The Sidereal’s world narrows to her journey, seeing only the next step forward.*
The Sidereal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Unswerving Juggernaut Principle to gain the following benefits
- +1 Evasion. If she’s unarmored, this bonus is non-Charm.
- Against unexpected attacks, she adds (Resistance + 5) soak and adds (Essence) Hardness, which stacks with other sources of Hardness.
- She can roll to cover her tracks reflexively, without ending Unswerving Juggernaut Principle.
Until a character succeeds on a tracking roll or sees her in motion, he won’t realize she’s moving in a straight line, no matter how obvious this is.
