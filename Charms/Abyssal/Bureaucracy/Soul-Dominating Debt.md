*On the occasions that she can be moved to largesse, the deathknight demands repayment with interest.*
The Abyssal makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Bureaucracy) bargain roll with (Essence) automatic successes against a single character, demanding repayment of a debt to her or an organization she belongs to.
Success magnifies the weight of the debt in her victim’s mind, driving him to repay it as soon as possible.
For debts that must be paid in money or goods, he’ll provide an amount representing a Resources expenditure one dot higher than what he owes (Exalted, p. 578). If repayment requires performing a service, this counts as a persuade roll to convince him to do so, reducing the level of supporting Intimacy needed to support by one (Exalted, p. 216). The Abyssal can demand repayment for debts that aren’t actually owed but no more than a one-dot Resource expenditure or an inconvenient task. If he dies before repaying the debt, he lingers as a ghost, still bound to repay it.
Resisting this influence costs (Abyssal’s Essence) Willpower. Doing so renders a character immune to this Charm for one week.
The Abyssal doesn’t need to roll against characters whose permanent Willpower is equal to or less than (her Essence, maximum 5). They can’t resist with Willpower. They’ll give whatever she asks to repay the debt, even pledging to serve her for the rest of their lives — and beyond. Whether the debt actually exists is irrelevant.
