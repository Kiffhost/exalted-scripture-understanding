The Dragon-Blood is privy to backroom dealings and covert assignations, drawing hushed whispers to her ear on currents of air. She adds (Linguistics/2, rounded up) bonus dice on rolls to eavesdrop on conversations. If she reads a character’s intentions while eavesdropping on him from medium range or further, he takes the −2 Guile penalty for being unaware of her even if he can see her.
