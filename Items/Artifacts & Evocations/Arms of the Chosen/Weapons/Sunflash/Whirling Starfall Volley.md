Swarm-Culling Technique The Solar illuminates the battlefield with her unleashed fury, sending Sunflash sweeping in all directions to cut down her foes. This Evocation upgrades Swarm-Culling Technique (Exalted, p. 416). When she triggers the Charm by winning Join Battle, the total number of reflexive attacks she may make increases to (Dexterity + Sunflash’s anima). Whenever one of her attacks raises Sunflash’s anima banner in the process, she may make an additional reflexive attack for it, up to a maximum of (Dexterity + 3) attacks.
