*The Lunar’s limbs flex and warp along unexpected angles to avoid obstacles between her and her prey.*
She rerolls (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) 1s on an attack roll and imposes a −1 penalty on her target’s [[Defense]]. With [[Dexterity]] 4, the Lunar may attack a lower-[[Initiative]] enemy through full cover with an appropriate stunt, but he receives +3 [[Defense]]. 
## Protean 

In shapes with a tail, tentacles, or similar flexible appendages, attacks with them ignore an additional point of [[Defense]] bonus.
