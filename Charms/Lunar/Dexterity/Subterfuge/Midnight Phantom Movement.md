*The Lunar slips unnoticed across the battlefield, weaving out of sightlines and into blind spots.*
She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on a [[Stealth]] roll to maintain concealment while moving, and ignores the increased penalty for crossing wide-open terrain (Exalted, pp. 203-204). 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with [[Ambush]] Hunter, the Lunar can use this Charm to rush from concealment. She adds its bonus on both the rush and her [[Stealth]] roll.
