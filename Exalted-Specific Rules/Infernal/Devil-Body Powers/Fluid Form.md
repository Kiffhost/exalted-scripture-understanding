Dots: 1 or 2

The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] is liquid, amorphous, or otherwise able to easily alter its size and shape. This has the following effects:
- She can move through the smallest gaps without inconvenience and effortlessly escape physical restraints such as manacles that logically would not be capable of restraining her body.
- If she has [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Infernal/Devil-Body Powers/Legendary Size|Legendary Size]], she can choose to count as her normal size instead when this is advantageous to her, like when hiding behind a low wall, compressing or displacing excess mass before returning to her full size.

For two dots, the Infernal can also shrink or compress her body to gain the [[Tiny Creature]] Merit, adding +2 non-Charm [[Defense|Evasion]] against enemies larger than the size of a small animal, and inflicting a two-success penalty on their [[Awareness]] rolls against her. Doing so is reflexive, as is reverting the change. It costs one Initiative when used in response to an attack.
