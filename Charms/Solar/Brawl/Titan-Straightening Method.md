Channeling primal strength through a surge of [[Essence]], the Lawgiver winnows and thrashes a clinched opponent in an attempt to shake him apart. The Solar immediately expends all remaining turns of control and makes an equal number of withering savaging attacks. Learning [[Titan-Straightening Method]] permanently enhances [[Dragon Coil Technique]], allowing the Solar to use it to grapple impossibly huge opponents for the express purpose of using [[Titan-Straightening Method]]. This Charm does not confer the power to lift, slam or hurl such opponents.
