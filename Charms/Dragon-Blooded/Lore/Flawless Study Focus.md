The Dragon-Blood clears her mind, drawing upon the clarity of the upper air to enter a receptive trance. To use this Charm, she must spend at least (10 − Intelligence) hours studying under a teacher or consulting a library, archive, or similar repository of information. She gains a temporary Lore specialty in a single topic possessed by her mentor or covered by the materials she had access to. She retains the specialty indefinitely, but may only have one specialty granted by this Charm at a time.
