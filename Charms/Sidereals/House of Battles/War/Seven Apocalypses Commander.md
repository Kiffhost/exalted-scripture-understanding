*Strategy Casting her hand toward a distant battlefield, the Sidereal calls down omens of her foretold victory.*
The Sidereal makes a Strategic Maneuver roll, gaining additional benefits based on the stratagem she chose:
### Ambush
The Sidereal uses the stars to calculate her enemy’s blind spot. This stratagem’s benefits apply to the Sidereal’s attacks against battle groups. Enemy battle groups suffer +1 target number on rolls opposing Stealth.
### Back to the Sea
The Sidereal cuts off every possibility of escape that fate would allow. Enemy battle groups suffer +1 target number on disengage rolls, while enemy commanders face +1 target number on rally for numbers actions. The Sidereal’s formation counters even supernatural means of escape, like Avoidance (p.
200) or the spell Travel Without Distance. The Sidereal rolls (Intelligence + War) to oppose the rolls for such effects, forcing an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll for those that are normally unrolled.
### Demoralized
The enemy encounters eerie portents of defeat as they march toward battle: rains of frogs, winds like wailing lamentations, blood-red comets appearing in the sky. At the beginning of the battle, one enemy battle group must immediately make a rout check. Instead of penalizing rout checks and command actions, the stratagem inflicts +1 target number on them.
### Fortifications
The Sidereal’s defenses are aligned perfectly with fate’s patterns. She and all allies gain −1 target number on rolls to take cover behind the fortifications. Enemy battle groups suffer +1 target number on damage rolls against targets who benefit from cover.
### Pincer Attack
The Sidereal arrays her forces around her enemy in an auspicious formation. Allied battle groups add the enemy’s onslaught penalties to the raw damage of their attacks.
### Strategic Placement
The Sidereal determines not only the location of the battle, but the time at which it will take place, so long as her choice is plausible. Alternatively, she can treat her extra successes as an introduce fact roll to reveal an advantageous feature of the chosen location.
Alternatively, the Sidereal can use the following unique stratagem:
Direful Omen (Threshold 2): At the beginning of the battle, the Sidereal may inflict the effect of one of her Descending (Caste) Horoscope Charms on all enemy battle groups for the scene. They don’t receive an opposed roll.
## Special activation rules
The Sidereal can use this Charm reflexively with Sagacious Formulation of Strategy. She must be present at the battle in person for this Charm’s benefits to apply.
