Hungry Tiger Technique Locking eyes with her quarry, the Solar’s gaze burns with the fury of her lethal intentions. As she strikes, engravings of past hunts along the Tusk’s shaft glow with argent light, awaiting another quarry added to their ranks. This Evocation upgrades [[Hungry Tiger Technique]] (Exalted, pp. 350-351). The Solar may pay an additional [[Willpower]] to use it against her quarry when he’s not in Crash.
