Perfect Fear Scent Suffusing herself with incandescent allure, the Lunar sears her image into her victim’s mind. A successful bargain or persuade roll to seduce one character or a successful threaten roll against one character is reinforced against others’ attempts to overturn it (Exalted, p. 221). The [[Willpower]] cost of initiating a roll to overturn the influence and of rejecting the influence in a Decision Point increases by one. The target ignores [[Resolve]] penalties, except those from [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], against rolls to overturn the influence, and 1s on such rolls subtract successes.
