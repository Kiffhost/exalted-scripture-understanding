*The Sidereal’s Caste Mark shines as a symbol of her authority over spirits, illuminating the unseen world.*
Dematerialized characters within short range of the Sidereal become visible to her and any other characters she wishes to extend this benefit to. She can focus this light on a dematerialized character within long range as a miscellaneous action, rolling ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) against his [[Defense|Evasion]] to render him visible. Spirits can always see the light shed by the Sidereal’s Caste Mark, letting the knowledgeable roll to recognize its use (p. XX).
