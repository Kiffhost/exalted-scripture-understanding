While concealed, the Lawgiver may grapple an opponent who has failed their Awareness check without taking a penalty to her concealment, gaining one non-Charm automatic success in the attempt, and one automatic success in the Initiative roll. If successful, the Exalt pulls her victim into the shadows. This is completely impossible to notice. The grabbed opponent seems simply to vanish. While the Lawgiver is still concealed, her victim is hidden for (control) rounds, unless the Solar’s Stealth check fails. The grapple is automatically released; though she is still thought to be holding the opponent in concealment, combat between the Lawgiver and her victim proceeds as if there was no grapple occurring. During this time, the Solar may attack her hidden foe without breaking concealment, but takes a -1 die penalty to her Stealth check for doing so. Victims killed during this attack die in an unnoticeable fashion and their bodies cannot be discovered for (Solar’s Essence) rounds, and then not without a difficulty 3 Awareness check that explicitly ignores the Solar’s whereabouts, regardless of its result.

### On Killing Shroud Technique

The backer said their favorite Caste is Night, and their favorite Ability is Stealth, so I wrote them a Charm that makes a Solar a terrifying opponent to take on in a poorly-lit space with plenty of hiding places, like a shadowy warehouse or the docks of Nighthammer in Nexus. Backer: Silent Shadow
