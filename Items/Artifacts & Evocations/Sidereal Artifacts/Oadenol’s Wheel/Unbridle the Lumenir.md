*The Sidereal releases the lumenir from the Wheel to serve her.*
Skere and Adrath can remain manifest while Oadenol’s Wheel is in weapon form. The ever-dour Adrath, is always mistrustful and suspicious of her surroundings, while her ebullient sister Skere is ever eager to explore the world. If a Sidereal uses Spirit-Shape Companion on the lumenir, they remain material, gaining the ability to dematerialize instead, using the same rules as materialization (Exalted, p. 510). They gain Hurry Home, letting them return to the Wheel. They return automatically when the Wheel returns to chariot form. 
## Special activation rules
This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience. It awakens for free when the Wheel’s master purchases or uses a Charm to permanently enhance the lumenir.
