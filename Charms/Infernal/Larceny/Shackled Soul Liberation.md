*The Infernal sets free those whose prisons lie within, unfettering their hearts.*

The Infernal brings freedom to the fettered, rolling ({Charisma or Wits} + Larceny) to use one of the following effects on a character within close range (including herself):
- She can use it as an influence roll to convince a character to abandon a promise, obligation, contract, penance, or a similar oath or commitment that he’s taken on as part of his own free will. If that promise is represented by an Intimacy, the level of supporting Intimacy needed to weaken it is reduced by one (Exalted, p. 215). If it isn’t, this roll instead instills the target with a Major Principle representing a belief that he is no longer bound by that promise. Either way, this costs (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) to resist.
- She can break a sorcerous binding imposed on a demon or other supernatural being. The difficulty is the summoner’s (Essence + 5), or the summoned being’s (Essence + 5) if it’s higher. Success breaks the binding. The summoned being retains any Ties to its summoner imposed by the binding, but they can now be eroded.
- She can break a supernatural oath, like a promise sanctified by an Eclipse Caste Solar. The difficulty is the (Essence + 5) of the character who used the effect. Doing so frees the target from the oath or any consequences of breaking it. This doesn’t affect any other characters bound by the oath. The character who sanctified the oath becomes aware that it’s been disrupted somehow, but doesn’t learn any other details. This Charm is incapable of shattering the surrender oaths sworn by the Yozis or other vows created by Essence 10 beings.

The Infernal can always use [[Cracked Cell Circumvention]] to enhance this Charm.
