Once, there was a maiden…
…who was always looking forward to the way
things would be.
She said, “Someday, I’m getting out of this place.”
“Someday, I’m going to kill that boy that put me here.”
“And while I wait, I don’t much mind,”
“‘cause it’s better to dream tomorrow than to be
there.”
“I’m holding at bay,” she said, “what I know to be true.”
“That I’ll never get out. I won’t let my dreams die!”
“I’ll hang on to hope,” she said, “until Time itself
ends. But—”
“There’s always an ending,” said Time.
