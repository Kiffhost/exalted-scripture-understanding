*Vengeant’s patient hatred wears down even the most resilient.*
To use this Evocation, the wielder must have surveilled him with [[Still Waters Hide Fury]] in the same scene. If her decisive attack hits him, his total onslaught penalty doesn’t refresh at the start of his turns until he’s taken a number of turns equal to the number of turns she spent undetected while using [[Still Waters Hide Fury]], maximum three. 

## Resonant

Vengeant’s decisive attacks against a despised opponent suffering from this Evocation ignore [[Hardness]] until his onslaught penalty refreshes.
