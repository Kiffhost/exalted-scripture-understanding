The character gains some form of natural weaponry, generally in the form of horns, or short but sharp claws and fangs. The one dot version of this Merit allows the character to inflict lethal rather than bashing damage with either unarmed decisive strikes or decisive savaging attacks during a grapple (the latter represents fangs). The four-dot version of this Merit grants larger, more dangerous natural weapons, allowing the characterâ€™s strikes or bites to both inflict lethal damage when savaging, and to be treated as a medium weapon for withering attacks.
### Drawback
Natural weaponry granted by the four-dot version of this Merit imposes a -1 penalty on disguise attempts.
