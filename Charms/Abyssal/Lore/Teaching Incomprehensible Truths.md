*Death’s Lawgiver opens her students’ minds to knowledge beyond the ken of the living, imparting the secret wisdom of the void.*
The Abyssal trains a student, letting him incur [[experience debt]] to purchase dots of relevant Attributes or Abilities, up to a maximum debt of (Abyssal’s [Essence + Intelligence] x 4) experience. This can raise his trait ratings above the Abyssal’s own. The training time required is divided by (Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + [[Intelligence]] + 5), although the Abyssal need only spend a single scene mentoring her student during this time. She can use this Charm to train herself.
For every three points the Abyssal’s student incurs, she may weaken one of his Intimacies by one step if it opposes one of her Principles or negative Ties. He can’t voluntarily strengthen the eroded [[Intimacy]] until he suffers narratively meaningful consequences for acting against it.
A [[Lore]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Abyssal train up to ([[Essence]]) students with a single use of this Charm. Not all students need take the same traits, although the [[Storyteller]] may require her to stunt appropriate instruction for training widely disparate subjects. Alternatively, she can train up to ([[Essence]] x5) students, but halves the total [[experience debt]] each can incur, rounded down.
[[Experience Debt]] Certain [[Charms]] let a player character increase or gain new traits by incurring [[experience debt]] equal to the normal cost of purchasing those traits. Any experience points she subsequently receives go toward paying off the debt, until it’s paid in full. An Exalt’s player may choose to pay off a debt solely with Abyssal Experience, Solar Experience, or similar if she could spend it on that trait. Until the debt is fully paid, the character can’t benefit from other effects that cause [[experience debt]]. [[Storyteller]] characters never go into [[experience debt]], but can’t benefit from such effects more than once per story.
