Drawing the fiddle’s bow across moonsilver strings, the musician assails foes with agonizing harmonies.
When the fiddler uses Voice of the Night Bird (Exalted, p. 447) to attack with the fiddle, it counts as a light artifact weapon (ACC: Close +5; Short +4; Medium +3; Long +0; Extreme −2; +10 DMG, OVW 3; Bashing, Martial Arts, Thrown (Short, Natural).
If the fiddler has Voice of the Night Bird’s Mastery effect, this Evocation instead grants medium artifact weapon traits (+12 DMG, OVW 4).
Note: This Evocation is appropriate for any artifact instrument meant to be used with Silver-Voiced Nightingale style.
