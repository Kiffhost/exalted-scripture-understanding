*When the Solar successfully parries decisive damage using Heavenly Guardian [[Defense]], she gathers an amount of bonus [[Initiative]] equal to the 1s and 2s on the damage roll.*
This [[Initiative]] is not transferred to her current [[Initiative]] value, but is instead recorded and set aside until she must use it. She may gather up to ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] in this manner, and may use it only to enhance Heavenly Guardian [[Defense]]. The Exalt may choose to expend any or all gathered [[Initiative]] into paying the cost of Heavenly Guardian [[Defense]], but doing so expends the bonus [[Initiative]]. In addition, the Solar may pay four motes, one [[Willpower]] to double the bonus [[Initiative]] she has already gathered for one tick, allowing her to further enhance the prerequisite. This Charm explicitly allows the Solar to use Heavenly Guardian [[Defense]] in crash, up to a limit of her gathered (or double gathered) bonus [[Initiative]]. This bonus [[Initiative]] may not be used to amplify the instance of Heavenly Guardian [[Defense]] from which it was gathered, nor can it be targeted by withering attacks; the [[Initiative]] is gone until the moment in which the Solar chooses to summon it.
