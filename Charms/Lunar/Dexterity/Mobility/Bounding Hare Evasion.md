Receding from the midst of battle in a blur of speed, the Lunar distances herself from her foes. On a successful disengage, she moves two range bands away from her enemy instead of one, instead of receiving additional movement if her foe pursues her. She canâ€™t attack and use this Charm on the same turn.
