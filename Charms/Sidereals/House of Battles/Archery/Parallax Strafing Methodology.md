*Space bends together with the Sidereal’s bowstring, opening impossible angles of attack.*
The Sidereal can make a withering or decisive attack as though she were attacking from a point within (Essence/2, rounded up) range bands of her. This includes her weapon’s range, determining a withering attack’s Accuracy bonus, whether she needs to aim, the applicability of cover, etc. This can potentially let her attack at extreme range.
