This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
Creation is filled with beasts both prosaic and exotic, and the character has formed a deep and profound bond with one of them. Although the familiar is (probably) no more able to speak the languages of men than any other beast, the character can roughly understand the chirps, pawings, barks, and gesticulations of his animal companion, and the familiar understands the character’s commands in turn. He can even share his familiar’s senses by concentrating and taking no other actions, so long as the familiar is somewhere within long range (see p. 197) of him.
One dot in this Merit provides a relatively weak familiar, such as a squirrel, owl, cat or dog. Two dots provides a formidable or useful beast, such as a riding animal or vicious predator—horses, simhata, tigers, and omen dogs are all appropriate two-dot familiars. Three dots provides a familiar that is in some way overtly exceptional or magical, such as one of the talking monkeys of Halta, an armored and fire-breathing ox mutated by the Wyld, a super-predator like a tyrant lizard, or a God-Blooded stallion fathered by the horse god Hiparkes.

#### Sidereal
Sidereals may take pattern spiders (Sidereal, p. XX) as three-dot familiars.
#### Abyssal
Abyssals can take undead animals (p. XX) as familiars. Zombie animals can only be familiars if they still retain a spark of the animal’s identity.
