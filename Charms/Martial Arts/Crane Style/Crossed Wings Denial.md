*The perfection of the martial artistâ€™s defense is like the beauty of the crane, so absolute in its calm refinement that seemingly nothing could ever disturb it.* 
The martial artist makes a (Wits + Martial Arts) roll that cannot be enhanced by magic, and banks all successes. Until her next turn, she may spend successes to add to her Parry on a one-for-one basis. Alternatively, she may expend a success after successfully blocking an attack to respond with a decisive counterattack. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood must expend two successes to add +1 to her Parry. The cost to make counterattacks is unchanged.
