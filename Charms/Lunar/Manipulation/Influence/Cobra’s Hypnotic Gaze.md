Speaking with mesmerizing tone and cadence, the Lunar lulls her prey into a half-trance. She may use Manipulation instead of Appearance to determine the bonus dice added (Exalted, p. 218) on an instill or persuade roll. If she adds any dice this way, her victim’s trance is deep enough that his Intimacies can’t modify his Resolve, positively or negatively, against that influence. He can still invoke Intimacies in a Decision Point.
