Pain strengthens the Lunar’s fierce will to survive, redoubling her unkillable vigor. She adds her wound penalty to her soak and her [[Hardness]]. This stacks with other [[Charms]] that grant [[Hardness]], but not with [[Hardness]] from artifact armor or animal shapes. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Berserker, the Overwhelming rating of withering attacks against the Lunar is reduced by her wound penalty.
