*Like a ravening specter, the Exalt cuts down all opposition in the blink of an eye.*
The deathknight makes (lowest of [[Strength]], [[Dexterity]] or [[Stamina]]) decisive attacks against one or more enemies. She can divide her [[Initiative]] among attacks however she wishes for their damage, minimum one per attack. She resets to base [[Initiative]] after completing all attacks if any of them hit, or loses two initiative per attack if they all miss. If the Abyssal uses any non-Excellency [[Melee]] [[Charms]] to enhance her attacks, she need only pay their cost once to benefit all of them.
With a [[Melee]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can make up to (highest of [[Strength]], [[Dexterity]] or [[Stamina]]) attacks and adds [[Initiative]] equal to the number of attacks she makes to the total she can allocate among them. She may move a single range band before each attack.
## Special activation rules
When the Abyssal uses [[Time-Scything Technique]], she can use this Charm reflexively to make its multiple attacks, as above, instead of just one.
