The Lunar’s unstoppable momentum leaves shattered walls and bent iron bars in her wake. When she crosses range bands, she reflexively attempts a feat of demolition to destroy an obstacle in her path, adding (Essence/2, round up) successes. She can’t use this Charm more than once per range band of movement. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Deadly Charge, the successes are non-Charm.
