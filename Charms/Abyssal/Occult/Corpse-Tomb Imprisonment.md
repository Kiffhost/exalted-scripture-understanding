*The deathknight subjects spirits to the travails of the flesh, a harsh lesson in mortal suffering.*
The Abyssal can activate this Charm after hitting a dematerialized enemy with an attack, before the damage roll. If she deals any damage, her enemy is forcibly materialized, and can’t dematerialize again until he’s taken two turns. Once he’s finished his second turn, he immediately dematerializes if that’s his natural state.
