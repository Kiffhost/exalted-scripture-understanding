*The deathknight anoints an apostle of death, conferring her dread authority upon him.*
The Abyssal confers her blessing on a willing character. Characters with Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]]s of loyalty, respect, or fear toward the Abyssal apply those [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] to the subordinate at Minor Intensity, and instinctively recognize he serves the deathknight’s will.
This Charm’s cost is reduced to two motes when used on characters with [[Whispers]], apostles blessed with [[Soul-Consuming Pyreflame Baptism]], or the Abyssal’s Lunar mate.
With [[Presence]] 5, [[Essence]] 2, the Abyssal may pay a four-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s effect to characters who only have Minor [[Intimacy|Ties]] of loyalty, respect, or fear.
