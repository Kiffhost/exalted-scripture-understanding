*The Abyssal overwhelms her foe’s defense with sheer force, sending him reeling back.*
The Abyssal can use [[Strength]] instead of [[Dexterity]] on unarmed attacks and attacks with heavy weapons.
Such rolls don’t benefit from effects that grant bonus [[Strength]] dots, double successes on [[Strength]] rolls, or replace her [[Strength]] with a higher value.
