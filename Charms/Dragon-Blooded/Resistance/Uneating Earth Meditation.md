Like the earth itself, the Terrestrial has no need for external nourishment. She ignores any deprivation penalties from starvation or dehydration (Exalted, p. 232). Additionally, she adds ([[Resistance]]) to the amount of time she can go before succumbing to starvation or dehydration, as long as she uses this Charm for that entire time.
