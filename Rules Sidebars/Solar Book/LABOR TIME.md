The longer work times given assume the character is dedicating a reasonable portion of her efforts each day to advancing her project, while still leaving time to attend to affairs of court, study [[sorcery]], pursue the goals of her Circle, or otherwise participate in the game the Storyteller is running. If the character must completely put aside a project for extended periods of time, the Storyteller should adjust the amount of time required before the character can attempt to complete her project accordingly.
