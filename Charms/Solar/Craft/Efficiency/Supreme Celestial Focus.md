*The Solar expands her mind and awakens her flesh, unlocking the brilliance that sings in her [[Essence]].*
This Charm allows the Exalt to raise an additional [[Craft]] rating from one to five by paying gold points instead of experience. The Exalt may raise up to ([[Essence]]) additional [[Craft]] ratings in this fashion, but each one after the first costs double the amount of gold points.
