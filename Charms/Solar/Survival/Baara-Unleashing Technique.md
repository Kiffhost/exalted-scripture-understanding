The Solar calls the inmost soul of her familiar outward, transforming it into a divine and terrible creature of wrath. This Charm can only be used on a familiar enhanced by [[Spirit-Tied Pet]], and the Solar must take a moment to sense ridetheanimalbeforeusingthisCharm.Wheninthisstate, shecantriggerSagaBeastVirtue,DeadlyPredatorMethod, [[Colossal Rampaging Beast]], and [[Ambush]] Predator Style simultaneously and for free, across any plane of existence. The Solar need not continue to sense ride her familiar after using this Charm, unless she wishes to augment its actions with [[Survival]] [[Charms]] across extreme long distances.

### On [[Baara-Unleashing Technique]]
