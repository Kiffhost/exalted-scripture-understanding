*The Infernal bears the mandate of the world’s makers, an authority beyond question by inferior things.*

When the Infernal makes a Bureaucracy roll or a bargain, instil, or persuade roll with any Ability, she rerolls a failed die for each of following that’s true of the characters she influences or interacts with:
- Their Essence is lower than hers.
- They hold a position below her in an organizational, political, or social hierarchy. This always includes First Circle demons.
- They have a Tie of reverence toward her.
- They’re gods.

When the Infernal rolls Bureaucracy to engage with an organization, the above criteria must apply to the majority of its membership for her to receive the bonus.
