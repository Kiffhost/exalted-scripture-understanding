# Sacrifice
Necromancy has a hunger that cannot be sated. Skilled necromancers can turn this to their advantage, sacrificing life and meaning to the void that exists within the art itself to draw forth greater power. Necromancers can make one minor or major sacrifice for a given working in order to provide it additional Means. 
## Minor
A minor sacrifice is a significant, meaningful thing destroyed for the sake of power, providing one additional Means. By far the most common minor sacrifice a necromancer might employ is the death of a mortal, spirit, or other sentient entity. Most animal sacrifices don’t rise to this level, but this isn’t always true for exceptional cases — slaughtering a cow might not suffice, but slaughtering six cows from a flock blessed by Ahlat might. 
Other sacrifices may also be employed, so long as they are personally meaningful to the necromancer and thematically relevant to the working. The Lord of the Last Ember plucked one of his beloved’s eyes as reagent for a curse against her wicked family, and Emil Dust-Speaker sacrificed his ability to love to build an afterlife for his people. The ravenous power of necromancy facilitates such sacrifices, which scar the soul beyond all but the most powerful healing. 
## Major
A major sacrifice is something darker, providing two additional Means. These are tragedies and cruelties out of legend, with either intense personal stakes or vast, indiscriminate horror. In the first case, the necromancer commits an act with deep, personal meaning — the death of every remaining member of his living family, the destruction of his home village, and the like. In the second, the necromancer simply inflicts death and suffering upon hundreds or thousands, wiping towns from the map or extinguishing an entire royal line.
