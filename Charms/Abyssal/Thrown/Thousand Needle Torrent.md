*The Abyssal’s weapon splits off countless spectral copies as it flies toward her victim, surrounding him in an inescapable rain of falling steel.*
The Abyssal adds a free full [[Abyssal Excellency]] on a [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack]] and renders it [[UNBLOCKABLE, UNDODGEABLE|undodgeable]]. Trivial foes within short [[range]] of the victim suffer damage equal to twice the amount dealt to him, and scenery and inanimate objects within this range suffer damage at the Storyteller’s discretion.
If the Abyssal wins [[Join Battle]] and uses this Charm on her first turn, she doesn’t need to [[aim]] to attack an enemy at medium or long [[range]].
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by landing a withering attack against an enemy with higher [[Initiative]] landing a withering attack against a nontrivial enemy that raises the deathknight’s [[Initiative]] above that of all her foes.
