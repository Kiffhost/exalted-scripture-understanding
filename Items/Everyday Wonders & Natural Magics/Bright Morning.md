Colloquially known as vision dust, this purple powder is made from a mixture of exotic Eastern herbs, including the rare skullweed found only in shadowlands. When smoked, it creates a sense of euphoria. A psychedelic and an entheogen, it induces all manner of hallucinations and allows the user to perceive [[Essence]] flows and dematerialized characters. She takes a −3 penalty on all actions based on [[Perception]] or [[Wits]] due to her distorted awareness. One dose of the drug lasts for roughly three hours. 

An overdose of [[Bright Morning]] is a dangerous way to intensify the user’s communion with the spirit world, combining the drug’s usual effects with the ability to touch and be touched by immaterial entities. Overdose acts as a poison with damage 1B/hour, duration 8 hours, penalty −3. The drug’s usual effects persist for the normal duration after the overdose ends. 

Using [[Bright Morning]] more than once per week or taking an overdose requires a ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll at difficulty (1 + previous uses that week) to avoid developing an [[Addiction]] to [[Bright Morning]] (Exalted, p. 167). Breaking the dependency requires a full month of abstention; this demands a difficulty 3 ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) roll if the drug is available.
