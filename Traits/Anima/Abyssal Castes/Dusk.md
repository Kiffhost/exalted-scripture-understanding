Dusk heralds the coming night, the darkness that sweeps across Creation as the sun dies. One day, it will never rise again. Such is the grim promise of the Dusk Caste. They are the right hand of death, the Swords of the Abyss, butchering armies and laying waste to nations. When the Peacebringers ride to war, they leave naught but corpses and silence in their wake. They exult in slaughter, in the forsaken hymns of their victim’s screams and the sound of soulsteel cutting flesh.
The Children of Ash count peerless killers, brilliant tacticians, morbid warrior-poets, and merciless warlords among their ranks. They uphold death’s chivalry through martial prowess and strength of arms, granting the gift of peace with the edge of a blade. They serve their Deathlords as generals, bodyguards, tacticians, and front-line champions, leading armies of the damned against their masters’ foes. It is rare that the Deathlords deploy the full force of their might, but that may soon change now that the Dusk Caste command their legions. 
Most Deathlords prefer to choose Peacebringers from those already skilled in violence and warfare, whether it’s a young hero cut down on the battlefield or a seasoned veteran who’s reached the end of her years. Others are chosen for their murderous potential, given the power to act on the hatred, bloodlust, or avarice that festers within their hearts. Some Deathlords enjoy choosing Dusk Castes from those who died violently, savoring their poetic justice of a Peacebringer avenging their own death. 
Renegade Dusk Castes wield their deadly prowess to their own ends. They might roam the Underworld as sellswords or wandering heroes, championing ghostly armies and waging the wars of the dead. Others turn their blades against the wicked, whether otherworldly fiends or all-too-human monsters, protecting those they hold dear by cutting down that which threatens them. Peacebringers who hold positions of command may convince their soldiers to defect with them, forging elite mercenary companies — and occasionally lending aid to their Deathlords’ foes.

# Anima Banner

Peacebringer’s Caste Marks are a dark mirror of the Dawn Caste’s: eight-pointed starbursts of darkness bleeding from their edges. A Dusk Caste’s anima banners are pitch black, occasionally edged with gray or tinged with dark reds or purples. It’s sometimes accompanied by screams of terror, a sound like an endless death rattle, or the scent of blood, ash, or rust.

# Anima Effects
- Death is Inevitable (Permanent): At bonfire anima, the Peacebringer adds (Essence/2, rounded up) to her base Initiative when she resets to base Initiative after a decisive attack. 
- Fear Made Flesh (Permanent) The Peacebringer adds (Essence/2, rounded up) non-Charm dice on threaten rolls and other fear-based influence, and can affect characters who’re normally immune to fear, like zombies and automatons. This doesn’t overcome magical immunity to fear. 
- Walking Apocalypse (10m; Reflexive; Instant): The Peacebringer resets all Charms related to combat and movement. Once per day.
# Caste Abilities

As unparalleled masters of violence and warfare, Dusk Castes choose Caste Abilities from Archery, Athletics, Brawl, Melee, Resistance, Ride, Thrown, and War.
#### ^Note:
The [[Martial Arts]] Ability cannot be chosen as Caste or Favored—instead, any character with [[Brawl]] as a chosen Caste or Favored Ability treats [[Martial Arts]] as Caste or Favored as well. A player may choose [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] as her [[Dawn]] Caste character’s Supernal Ability, but applies the benefits of that choice only to one or the other. Also, characters with [[Martial Arts]] dots must possess the [[Martial Artist]] Merit.
