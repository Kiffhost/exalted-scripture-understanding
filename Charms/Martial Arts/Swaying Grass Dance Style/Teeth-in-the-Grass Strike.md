The dancer feints high, then suddenly scythes up from below, forcing her enemy off guard. She adds (Performance) dice to a decisive attack. If her attack roll exceeds her target’s Resolve, it becomes a surprise attack. The first time in a scene she uses this to enhance a distract gambit, it becomes an ambush. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by beating a nontrivial enemy’s Resolve with a dance-based Performance roll. 
## Mastery

If the dancer lands an unexpected attack, she adds (Performance/2, rounded up) dice to the damage roll, or a gambit’s Initiative roll.
