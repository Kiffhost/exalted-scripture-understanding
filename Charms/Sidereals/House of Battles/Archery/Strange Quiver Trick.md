The Sidereal’s quiver is stocked with the right arrow for every eventuality. Reaching for ammunition on her person, the Sidereal rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Archery]]) to produce a mundane object that’s small enough to fire with [[Generalized Ammunition Technique]] with a [[Resources]] rating less than or equal to her successes. She can’t use this to steal specific objects. 

## Special activation rules

This Charm can be placed in a flurry. If the Sidereal flurries it with an attack to fire the object using [[Generalized Ammunition Technique]], uses her attack in place of this Charm’s roll.
