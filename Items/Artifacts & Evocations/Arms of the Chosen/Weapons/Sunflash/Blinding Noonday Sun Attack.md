*Sunflash’s anima banner erupts like a nova, unleashing a wave of searing brilliance that blinds the Solar’s foes.*
This Evocation can only be used while Sunflash’s anima banner is at bonfire. The wielder makes a decisive attack that erupts in a nova of light as long as it deals 1+ levels of damage, blinding the target until the end of his next turn. This imposes a −3 penalty on all sight-dependent actions. Characters within short range of the target must roll ([[Wits]] + [[Dodge]]) against her attack roll or be likewise blinded until the end of their next turn. 

## Resonant

The blinding inflicted by this attack lasts until end of scene. Trivial characters are blinded permanently.
