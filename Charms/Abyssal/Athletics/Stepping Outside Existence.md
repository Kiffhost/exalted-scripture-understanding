*Driven by hunger for a distant foe, the Abyssal lunges through the darkness that lies beyond the world.*
The Abyssal rushes an opponent within medium range. If successful, she instantly teleports into close range with him without crossing the space in between, instead of a rush’s usual benefits.
While using [[Nowhere Is Safe]], this Charm’s range becomes long.
