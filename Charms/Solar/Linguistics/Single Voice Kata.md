There is a point in the infinite distance where purity and entropy touch. That point is both “before” and “after” but the Solar may reach it with a thought, to draw forth perfect language. While this Charm is active, the Solar speaks a language that can be understood by all who hear it. Knowledge of this language is purely instinctual; characters understand the Solar’s words as she shapes them. Her perfect language cannot be learned, as it has no intelligible words, letters or mechanics. Consequently, it cannot be repeated back to the Solar such that she would comprehend it. This Charm allows purely one way communications, imparting no knowledge of languages the Solar has not yet learned. Spirits despise being addressed by a Solar using this Charm, and the Fair Folk feel physical pain to hear it spoken. A Solar should only use this Charm against such beings if she deliberately intends to cause offense.
