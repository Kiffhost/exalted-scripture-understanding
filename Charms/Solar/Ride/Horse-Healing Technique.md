The Lawgiver trades blood and life to sustain her honored companion. With a dramatic action lasting a scene, in which the Exalt cares for her mount, treating its wounds and soothing it with words, she can heal her mount of ([[Essence]]) lethal or bashing damage, taking a single lethal or bashing damage in exchange. This Charm can be combined with [[Survival]] and [[Medicine]] [[Charms]] to treat injured mounts.
