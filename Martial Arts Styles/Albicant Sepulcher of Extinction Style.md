This is the forbidden art of the [[Bishop of Chalcedony Thurible|Bishop of the Chalcedony Thurible]], a gospel of death preached through violence. Nonexistence is not to be feared — the ghost who would become the Bishop understood this as he looked upon the [[Neverborn]], forever denied the succor of oblivion.
Violence, then, is the truest act of compassion. People cling to their transient existence, mistaking the suffering and the sorrow of life for something meaningful. They fear death, dreading the arrival of that which is inevitable. It is a kindness to free them from such fetters. The nothingness that follows their death will be no more intolerable than that which preceded their birth.
Few save the Bishop have studied this style. Even among the [[Deathlords]], the power to practice Sidereal Martial Arts is rare, while only a scarce handful of Abyssals have yet attained the spiritual mastery needed to learn them. Many of his fellow [[Deathlords]] covet this power, and would grudgingly bear whatever steep cost the Bishop would extract to train a promising deathknight.
