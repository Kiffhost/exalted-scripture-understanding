*Death’s Lawgiver bestows the Neverborn’s dark blessings upon her familiar, creating a monstrosity worthy of her awful glory.*
The Abyssal’s familiar rolls [[Join Battle]] as it undergoes a monstrous transformation. It adds (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) automatic successes on attack rolls and threaten rolls, and adds (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) to the raw damage of its attack. It’s immune to fear-based influence. If it has Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]], she may have it grow beyond them, losing those [[Merits]].
The Abyssal’s familiar also gains additional benefits based of Beloved Horror Boon’s effects she’s granted it:
Carrion-Eater’s Wisdom: The deathknight may have her familiar’s transformation give it a form in which it’s capable of speech and fine manual dexterity.
Cadaver-Beast Thews: The familiar adds (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) automatic successes on feats of strength and adds her [[Essence]] to its effective [[Strength]] to determine what feats it can attempt. If it has Legendary [[Size]], it adds ([[Essence]] x2) to its effective [[Strength]] instead.
Corpse-Hide Resilience: The familiar gains +1 soak for each purchase of this boon it has.
Dread Predator Alacrity: The familiar adds (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) automatic successes on movement actions.
Endurance Beyond Extinction: Each purchase of this boon subtracts one success from decisive damage rolls against the familiar.
Lurking Horror Refinement: The familiar adds (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) automatic successes on [[Stealth]] rolls.
Unholy Beast of Slaughter: The familiar adds (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) to its base [[Initiative]].
Wretched Abomination Form: The Abyssal may grant the familiar an additional dot of mutations for each purchase of this boon. She chooses which mutations are granted each time she uses this Charm.
With an [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Abyssal may grant her familiar Legendary [[Size]] (p. XX), unless it had the Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] merits. If it already had Legendary [[Size]], it grows even larger, letting it attack with its natural weapons out to short range and requiring enemies within short range to disengage to move away from it.
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset when a familiar incapacitates a nontrivial enemy with [[Unslakable Hunger Unleashed]].
