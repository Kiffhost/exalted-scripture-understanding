*The Sidereal binds mortals to her fate as easily as she does beasts.*
The Sidereal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to present the Ordained Bridle of Mercury to a mortal. If she succeeds on the roll, he’ll let her place the bridle on him, though he’ll retain no memory of this embarrassing moment. Rather than becoming her familiar, he gains a Minor Tie of familiarity to her that he can’t voluntarily erode unless he spends one Willpower. Affected characters convert dice added by this Intimacy on rolls to resist the Sidereal’s arcane fate to automatic successes.
They can roll to resist even if they’re trivial.
The Sidereal can let fate provide, specifying an occupation and personality and learning where she can find someone fitting that description to whom she can present the bridle. Alternatively, she can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to present it to a mortal of her choice.
If the Sidereal’s target is capable of being ridden by her as her mount — for example, because he’s a quadrupedal mutant — she waives the Willpower surcharge.
This effect isn’t subject to Ordained Bridle of Mercury’s once-per-session limit.
