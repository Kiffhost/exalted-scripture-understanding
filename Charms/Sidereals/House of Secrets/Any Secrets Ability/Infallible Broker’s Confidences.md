The Sidereal’s discerning eye seeks out those she can trust with her secrets. Contemplating some specific piece of information, the Sidereal makes a special (Perception + Secrets Ability) read intentions roll against a character. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
-  Does he know this information? 
-  What would he do to obtain this information? 
-  How would this information help or hurt him? 
-  Who would he share this information with? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact. Reset: Once per scene.
