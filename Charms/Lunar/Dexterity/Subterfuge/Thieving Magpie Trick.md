Creeping unnoticed through palatial treasure-halls, the Lunar walks away bedecked with others’ riches. She adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice to a [[Larceny]] roll, either to pickpocket a character who can’t perceive her or to otherwise steal an object unnoticed while in concealment. If successful, characters who failed to beat her [[Stealth]] roll can’t notice the theft until (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) minutes have passed, or circumstances draw attention to it. 
## Totemic 

ALunarwhosespiritshapehasTinyCreature or Minuscule [[Size]] may learn this as a [[Manipulation]] Charm, with [[Snake-Finger Style]] and Moonlight-onMist Puzzle (p. XX) as its prerequisites.
