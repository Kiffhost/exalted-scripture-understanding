*The Sidereal’s fate is interwoven with trinkets, curios, and weapons, always close at hand no matter the distance.*
After a scene spent interacting with an object light enough for the Sidereal to wear or hold in her hands, she binds it to her fate. While it’s within long range, she can reflexively return it to her hand via favorable coincidences: a stumbling enemy kicks her weapon toward her, a strong wind blows a garment off a clothesline, a ring dropped off a cliff lands on the head of a curious hybroc. Beyond this range, the Sidereal can make ([[Perception]] + appropriate [[Craft]]) rolls to discern general details about the object’s current circumstances regardless of distance, though she can’t make out specifics — e.g., she could tell that it’s in a heavily guarded vault, but couldn’t make out the names or faces of individual guards. The Sidereal can recall distant objects with a ([[Wits]] + appropriate [[Craft]]), setting in motion a chain of favorable coincidences: a guard steals it and flees in her direction to avoid punishment, a thief fences it to someone shipping goods to her location, a dog grabs it and runs, etc. One success ensures its return, but with no guarantee it’ll be quick. Two successes ensure it’s back within a week; three successes, a day; four successes, an hour; and five successes, a minute. The Sidereal can bind herself to any number of objects.
