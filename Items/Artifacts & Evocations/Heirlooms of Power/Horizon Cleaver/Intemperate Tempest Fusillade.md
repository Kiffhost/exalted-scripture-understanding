Lightning rips from [[Horizon Cleaver]], striking in all directions. The wielder may pay two motes and one [[Willpower]] when she uses [[Brilliant Reproach]] to apply her decisive attack roll against up to ([[Essence]]) total enemies within range. She divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among all hit characters, rounding up, to determine the decisive damage rolled against them, ignoring [[Hardness]]. If she loses control of the lightning, then it instead strikes ([[Essence]]) randomly chosen targets. 

## Dissonant

A character dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation.
