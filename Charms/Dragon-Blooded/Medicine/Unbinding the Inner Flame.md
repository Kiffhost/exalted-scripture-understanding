The Dragon-Blood stokes the flames of vitality with a precisely-measured strike to the heart chakra, inflaming the Essence of herself or an ally until blood boils and thews surge with unrestrained might. She grants a touched character a bonus dot of Strength and doubles 10s on his decisive damage rolls. On each of his turns, he gains one mote and — if he’s not crashed — one Initiative. The power unleashed by this Charm is greater than the body can endure unharmed. Once it ends, the target suffers a level of aggravated damage, which cannot be prevented.
