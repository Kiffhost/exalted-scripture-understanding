The idea of venerating other, lesser beings offends the Infernal. She seeks to prove herself as the superior object of worship, disrupting organized religion by displaying her diabolic miracles and denouncing or performatively humbling religious figures. She will aggressively promote her personal cult at the expense of others, stealing or desecrating relics, vandalizing shrines, and otherwise laying waste to the trappings and architecture of any faith that does not give her rightful reverence.

**Duration**: Session.
Heaven-Shaming Idolatry can be ended prematurely if the Infernal’s actions result in a character towards whom the Infernal has a positive Major or Defining Intimacy rejecting her.
