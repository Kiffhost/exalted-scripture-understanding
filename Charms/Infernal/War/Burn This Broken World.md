*Creation’s fields are sown with pain, rage, and grief, the seeds of a world burn in injustice. Let it all burn away.*

The Infernal makes Strategic Maneuver roll to enact a unique stratagem at difficulty 4. If successful, her army visits gratuitous destruction upon the land as they march toward battle: setting fires, salting fields, fouling rivers, slaughtering wildlife, and filling the air with the scent of gore. This has the following effects:
- Enemy battle groups treat the entire battlefield as an environmental hazard with difficulty 4, Damage 2L/round. They suffer a single interval of this hazard immediately upon Joining Battle, representing losses and logistical disruptions suffered on the march.
- 1s subtract successes on enemy battle group’s rout checks and on rally and rally for numbers actions targeting them. 2s subtract successes as well for groups with poor Drill.
- The stratagem also inflicts the effects of a Demoralize stratagem (Exalted, p. 212).

Even if the Infernal fails the Strategic Maneuver roll, she still enacts a Demoralize stratagem, though the opposing commander enacts his stratagem as well.
