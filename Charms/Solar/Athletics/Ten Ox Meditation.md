The Solar magnifies her physical [[Essence]], increasing her ability to move massive loads. This Charm supplements an attempt to lift or break something, allowing the Solar to attempt an action with a prerequisite beyond her current [[Strength]] rating. Pay two motes and roll the Exaltâ€™s ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) as normal, converting each three successes into a dot of [[Strength]] as needed, until the Solar meets the prerequisite. This bonus [[Strength]] does not enhance her current dice pool, as this momentary surge of might only establishes whether she can succeed with her current dice. Note that she must still have enough successes remaining, after increasing her [[Strength]], to meet the difficulty requirement of the feat.
