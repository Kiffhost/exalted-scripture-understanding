*The Sidereal rides undeterred through fire and ice, drawing on a bond between her and her mount forged over nights spent sleeping in the open under pouring rain and miles run through blistering heat.*
The Sidereal adds ([[Stamina]]) dice on a [[Mounted Fighting|mounted]] [[Movement|movement action]] and ignores that many points of environmental penalties (including from [[difficult terrain]]). She also adds this bonus on her and her mountâ€™s roll against any [[environmental hazards]] they ride through. Success on a [[rush]] or [[disengage]] awards both her and her mount one [[Initiative]].
