The Lawgiver walks the battlefield as a legend, feared and respected by friend and foe alike. After an enemy general takes a rally for numbers action (p. 210), the Solar may use this Charm to restore an amount of Magnitude to her battle group equal to the 1s and 2s in her opponent’s roll. This new influx of soldiers is pulled from the ranks of her enemy’s forces as they switch sides.
