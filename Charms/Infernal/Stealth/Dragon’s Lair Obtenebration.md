*The Infernal draws the world into an everlasting night, an oubliette of endless shadow haunted by an unseen killer.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have [[Noon-as-Night Invocation]] active and be in concealment against at least one nontrivial enemy. She gains the following benefits:
- The darkness twists space into the Infernal’s lair. She can attack enemies within the darkness regardless of the distance between them, ignoring even full cover. Withering attacks use the highest Accuracy bonus available to the Infernal’s weapon. She must still be able to perceive enemies to attack them.
- If an enemy within the darkness has an Initiative lower than the Infernal’s, her attacks against him are automatically surprise attacks. If the attack was already unexpected, she adds (Essence) dice of decisive or post-soak withering damage instead.
- When an enemy within the darkness makes an Awareness roll opposing her Stealth, his 1s and 2s subtract successes.
- Whenever an enemy within long range enters the darkness for the first time each scene, she senses it and may reflexively make a decisive attack against him. This doesn’t include enemies caught in the darkness when she first uses this Charm. Against enemies in concealment, she must succeed on a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll in order to do so, adding (higher of Essence or 3) non-Charm successes.
- If she has [[Noon-as-Night Invocation#Soul-Withering Shadows (Stealth 5, Essence 3) (+3m)|Noon-as-Night Invocation (Soul-Withering Shadows)]], she gains any motes that her enemies lose to it, maximum (Essence x2, maximum 10) per round.
- If she has [[Noon-as-Night Invocation#Lost in the Dark (Essence 4, Soul-Withering Shadows (Stealth 5, Essence 3) (+3m) Soul-Withering Shadows )|Noon-as-Night Invocation (Lost in the Dark)]], she gains one Willpower when an enemy loses Willpower to it, maximum once per scene.

The Infernal must pay one Initiative at the start of each of her turns to sustain this Charm. If she can’t, it ends.
### Blasphemy
When the Infernal enters her [[Devil-Body]], she can use both [[Noon-as-Night Invocation]] and this Charm reflexively, waiving their Willpower costs.
## Special activation rules
This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived if the Infernal uses it together with [[Tenebrous Horror Transformation]] when she activates [[Noon-as-Night Invocation]].
