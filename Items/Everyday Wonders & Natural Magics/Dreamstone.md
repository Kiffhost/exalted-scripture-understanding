Most of these extraordinarily rare green opals come from open-pit mines near the city of Gem. Held while sleeping, they store and preserve one’s dreams. Small, acorn-sized stones catch the night’s first dream; larger, apricot-sized gems capture all of the night’s dreams. Anyone may touch the stone to her forehead to dream the stored dreams the next time she sleeps, or hold the stone for a time in a peaceful spot to experience the dream as a waking vision. The stone preserves dreams until they’re purged using a special meditative technique.
