The Dragon-Blood wears her armor like a second skin, pliant and yielding as living wood, as she moves with the sinuous grace of a dancing dragon. She lowers her armor’s mobility penalty by 1 for a single tick. If it’s light armor, she instead adds a non-Charm die on rolls to rush or disengage. In Wood Aura, this Charm’s duration lasts for as long as the Dragon-Blood remains in Aura.
