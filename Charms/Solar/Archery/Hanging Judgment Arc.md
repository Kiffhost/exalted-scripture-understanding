The Lawgiver’s divine judgment pours down on the heads of the wicked. Immediately upon joining battle, the Solar may target a specific bit of scenery that is not occupied by an enemy combatant. Naming it off limits, she fires a scintillating shot high into the air. Her arrow flies up and up and does not come down unless the opponent crosses through, over, or into the designated position, at which point they become subject to a decisive attack with the Solar’s unmodified attack pool, and with damage equal to the Initiative she had the moment she fired the shot. In addition, this shot is enhanced by the prerequisite at no extra charge. If Hanging Judgment Arc succeeds at damaging the target, the Solar’s Initiative does not return to base. If the Exalt is crashed, slain, or the scene ends without the attack being triggered, the arrow comes down and will set fire to any flammable thing it touches. AnyuseofthisCharmmustoccurinplaceswithenoughvertical space to fire an arrow upward without it getting lodged in the ceiling. The player can’t threat-mark an area inside an enclosed building or chamber while standing outside. 

## Special activation rules

If the Lawgiver threatens a specific character with this attack, (ie “Winglord Kvetu may not retreat across that bridge”) the attack gains (Essence) automatic successes, (Essence) bonus dice, and (Essence) automatic damage successes. At Archery 5+, Essence 3+, the Lawgiver may use this Charmoutofcombatforeightmotes,settingtheCharm’s duration to Indefinite, and giving it a base damage of 17. With Archery 5+ Essence 4+, the out-of-combat use becomes Stackable up to (Essence) times. These bans do not end if the Solar is crashed or slain, only if the threat is triggered or the Lawgiver ends her commitment.

### On Hanging Judgment Arc

The backer had a really awesome name and idea for an Archery Charm, but execution was trickier than it looked. In case you are wondering, if you mark an area where your ally is standing when an enemy triggers the attack, the attack is precise enough to only hit the enemy. But whether or not they both catch on fire is a totally different issue. Backer: Andrew Bartkus
