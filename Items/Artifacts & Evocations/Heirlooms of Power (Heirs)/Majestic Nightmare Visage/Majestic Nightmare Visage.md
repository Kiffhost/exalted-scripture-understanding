When Gerold Bronze-Arm set out from the Cult of the Violet Fang’s cathedral to quest against his fae ancestor, Magnanimous Gwenyant, he donned the mask of a raksha prince, proclaiming himself the Childe of Midnights Unremembered as he stole into Gwenyant’s court.
Living and scheming alongside the Fair Folk, Gerold unraveled the court’s deepest secrets, and forged a conspiracy against Gwenyant through blackmail, intrigue, and backroom dealing. When Gerold ousted the raksha noble from his throne, he won Gwenyant’s favor and boon, for such has e’er been the compact between Gwenyant and his children in the Violet Fang.
Returning to Creation, Gerold doffed his mask, setting it aside as he took his place on the Council of the Returned. But the Childe of Midnights Unremembered was not ready for their tale to end so soon, and Gerold’s mask had grown heavy with the Childe’s legend, becoming the Majestic Nightmare Visage.
Gerold’s granddaughter, Ardent Leonore, donned the Childe’s visage to drive away a Wyld Hunt that declared the Cult of the Violet Fang’s adherents Anathema, sowing chaos and discord among the shikaris’ ranks. Finn the Whale-Singer stole Majestic Nightmare Visage from the Cult’s vaults when he fled from it, seeking a life away from the Wyld and the uncanny Northwest — though in time, he would lose himself within the Childe. The Cult has hunted after it since, considering it a sacred relic to be reclaimed, but it has thus far eluded them.
Majestic Nightmare Visage is a full-face mask of oak heartwood with a glossy green jade lacquer, threaded with moonsilver inlay evoking the thin, cruel features of a raksha prince. When the mask is attuned and worn, the inlay dances across its surface in an eerily lifelike motion, reflecting the wearer’s own expression. It radiates the mien of an all-conquering monarch, a prince whose will cannot be denied.

## Evocations of Majestic

Nightmare Visage Majestic Nightmare Visage’s wearer adds a non-Charm success on rolls to disguise herself as the Childe of Midnights Unremembered, and +1 non-Charm Guile against any action that would contradict her disguise as the Childe. If a Dragon-Blooded wearer uses Terrifying Forest-Devil Mask to disguise herself as the Childe, its cost is reduced by two motes, and the mask can’t be removed with gambits.
