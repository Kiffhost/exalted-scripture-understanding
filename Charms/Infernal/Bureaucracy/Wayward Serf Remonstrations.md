*The Infernal metes out punishment to those who defy her laws, making a gruesome example to deter such disobedience.*

The Infernal passes judgment on a character who’s violated a law of Hell that’s been established in play (by the Storyteller, an introduce fact roll, [[Infernal Caprice Edict]], etc.). She can also punish characters who disobey her commands if they’re First Circle demons or if they’re subordinate to her within any kind of hierarchy. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on an attack roll against the offender, an influence roll against him to redress his crimes, or an influence roll to denounce him to others.

On an attack, the Infernal adds an automatic success on the damage roll and deals aggravated damage with decisive attacks. On an influence roll, the Willpower cost to resist is increased by one, and characters can’t use Intimacies based on opposition to the laws of Hell, hierarchy, or authority figures.
