The Solar’s heart is hardened against all emotion, becoming distant and utterly lacking in empathy or feeling. While in Limit Break, he is treated as having no Intimacies whatsoever, making his decisions based purely on what is most efficient. His lack of empathy imposes a -2 penalty on all social rolls.
Heart of Flint can be ended prematurely if the Solar’s apathy allows a character that he holds a Major or Defining positive Tie towards to come into life-threatening danger.
