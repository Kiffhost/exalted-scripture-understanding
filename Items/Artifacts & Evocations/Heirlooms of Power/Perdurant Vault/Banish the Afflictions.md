Perdurant Vault’s wielder may retreat to a place of serenity and meditate over the shield, banishing a disease or poison from her body into the artifact’s dreamrealm. After a full day of meditation, the wielder rolls (Stamina + Resistance), rerolling (Essence) failures. Against disease, she rolls against its morbidity, reducing its intensity by one step on a success or purging it entirely if it’s Minor. Against poison, each success reduces its remaining duration by one interval. When the wielder completely purges a disease or poison using this Evocation, that affliction manifests as a spirit in the City of Opal Unstained, as per Protect the Empress. Such spirits linger for a number of weeks equal to (their Essence), attacking visitors to the dream-realm or attempting to corrupt them when encountered. Destroying them allows the wielder to add (Essence) bonus dice to her (Stamina + Resistance) rolls to resist that disease or poison for as long as she remains attuned to Perdurant Vault. This Evocation may only be used once per week.
