*Channeling her rage, the Exalt strikes away a blow at the last second, or steps between strikes to get at her target’s throat.*
This Charm can be activated after an opponent’s attack roll, raising the Solar’s [[Defense|Parry]] or [[Defense|Evasion]] by a number equal to the 1s in the attack roll. This Charm takes precedence over those that reroll 1s.
