Some magic, especially Charms, refer to storing, vanishing, or banishing objects Elsewhere.
In [[Hauberk-Summoning Gesture]]:

It is implied that an object sent Elsewhere is always immediately accessible to the Exalted that banished it, but practically inaccessible (and undetectable) to any other, given that it is "not here".
