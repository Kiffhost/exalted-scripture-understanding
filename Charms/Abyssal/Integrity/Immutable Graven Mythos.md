*Such is the Abyssal’s dedication to her grave purpose that she remains immutable by will alone.*
When the Abyssal is exposed to a Shaping effect, she can defend with this Charm, regardless of what Ability she uses to resist. She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) successes on her opposed roll or adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) to the targeted static value. If the Shaping effect is rolled, its 1s subtract successes.
Even if the Abyssal fails, she can pay one [[Willpower]] to mitigate the consequences. If a transformation is normally permanent, it becomes possible for the Abyssal to break it, though it’s up to her to figure out how — often with the use of [[Lore]], [[Medicine]], or [[Occult]].
The Abyssal also can’t be changed in a way that kills her, leaves her unable to take any actions, or stops her from using [[Charms]] or other magic at all — at least, not immediately. The [[Storyteller]] can inflict a weakened version of the effect that develops progressively, giving the Abyssal ample time to find a way to break it, as above — seasons, or even years. Alternatively, the [[Storyteller]] can alter the transformation’s nature so that it doesn’t have such an impact on the deathknight.
With an [[Integrity]] 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, Immutable Graven Mythos’s bonus becomes non-Charm.
Against Shaping effects that are normally unrolled, the Abyssal rolls ([[Essence]] + current temporary [[Willpower]]) against the opposing character’s (current temporary [[Willpower]]). That character loses one success and one [[Willpower]] for each 1 or 2 that he rolls. Success negates that effect and renders the Abyssal immune to it for the rest of the session. If the Shaping isn’t created by a character, the [[Storyteller]] sets a difficulty for the Abyssal’s roll.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal can invoke her [[Whispers]] instead of paying the [[Willpower]] cost to mitigate a Shaping effect’s consequences.
