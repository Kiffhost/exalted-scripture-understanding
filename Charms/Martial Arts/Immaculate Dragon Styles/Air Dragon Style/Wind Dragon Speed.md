*The Immaculate moves with wind-rivaling grace, striking and instantly regaining her balance and composure.*
She may flurry a disengage with an attack, ignoring the usual flurry penalties. If she successfully disengages and ends her movement at short range or further from all enemies, not counting crashed foes or trivial characters, she doesnâ€™t lose [[Initiative]] for disengaging.
In Air Aura, the Immaculate may flurry a disengage with an aim action. This allows her to move and aim on the same turn, but only benefits Air Dragon attacks.
