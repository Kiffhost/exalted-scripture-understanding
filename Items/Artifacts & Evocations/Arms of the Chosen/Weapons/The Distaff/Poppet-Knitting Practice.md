*Weaving a gauzy human silhouette of silk, the Exalt breathes her desire into it, giving it a sort of life.*
The resulting creature has a mortal’s strength despite its fabric frame, and needs neither nourishment nor sleep. Its gestures are deeply expressive, but it cannot speak. Though it lacks independence, creativity, and a soul, the servant can follow complex instructions within its ambit. Weaving a fabric servant takes one scene, though [[Craftsman Needs No Tools]] (Exalted p. 292) permits the wielder to finish it in one turn. It’s a [[non-combatant]] built as a mortal Quick Character (Exalted, p. 494). The Exalt chooses a role for the servant, such as farmhand, valet, sentinel, spy, chirurgeon’s aide, or weaver. It has ([[Essence]] + [[Craft]] {Weaving}) dice for actions relevant to its focus, and 3 dice for other actions. It cannot roll more dice than the Exalt’s own unmodified pool for any action. A fabric servant is utterly loyal to its maker. She may delegate authority over it to any number of individuals or groups; it will serve them with equal loyalty, overridden only by its maker’s instructions. It won’t destroy itself by accident, but has no compunctions about being undone in the course of its duties. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation can only be awakened by a wielder with [[Craft]] (Weaving) 3. 

## Resonant

The wielder may spend an additional three gold crafting experience points to change this Evocation’s duration to Instant, creating a fabric servant that can persist indefinitely.
