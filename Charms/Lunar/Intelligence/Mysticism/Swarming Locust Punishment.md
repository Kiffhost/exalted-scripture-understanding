Nature enacts the Lunar’s judgment. When a character breaks an oath sanctified with Blood Geas Binding, he’s beset by vermin. While not dangerous enough to present a threat in combat, they impose the following consequences: 
-  The oathbreaker suffers a difficulty (Lunar’s Essence), damage 1B/hour environmental hazard while traveling through wilderness as innumerable pests assail him. He may avoid this by remaining in a single location, or traveling through regions devoid of animal life. 
-  The animals’ interference imposes a −4 penalty on rolls to navigate wilderness, forage, find shelter, track characters through the wilderness, or conceal tracks. 
-  Each night, he rolls (Stamina + [Integrity, Resistance, or Survival]) at difficulty (Lunar’s Essence). If he fails, the animals interrupt his sleep, preventing him from regaining Willpower and from reducing fatigue penalties. 
-  After three nights in a row without restful sleep, hegainstheObsessionDerangement(Exalted,p. 169) at Minor intensity or increases its intensity by one step, fixating on finding and exterminating his animal tormentors. This Derangement persists after the curse ends. This curse lasts (Lunar’s Essence) weeks. Alternatively, she can revoke it or set a condition by which the target can end it.
