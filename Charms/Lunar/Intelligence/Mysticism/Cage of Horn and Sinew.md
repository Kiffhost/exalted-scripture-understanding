At times, the Lunar shaman must impart humbling lessons to spirits. After successfully using GhostBanishing Howl on a spirit whose [[Essence]] doesn’t exceed hers, she traps it in an animal within medium range. She can’t target familiars or magically enhanced animals. The spirit remains trapped for (1 + threshold successes) months, or until the animal dies. Whileimprisoned,thespiritcontrolstheanimal’sbody. He uses its traits, and can’t use his own Attributes, Abilities, [[Merits]], or [[Charms]]. He retains his memories and Intimacies, but his intelligence is diminished to that of the animal, potentially rendering him incapable of complex thought or emotion. At the Storyteller’s discretion, the spirit may regain his mental faculties as his imprisonment progresses. He can’t attempt suicide in the animal’s body; its survival instincts override his will if he tries. Once the spirit is freed, he gains a Defining [[Intimacy]] reflecting his animal vessel’s nature and his experiences during the imprisonment — a demon sealed inside a watchdog might form a Tie of loyalty to its master; a god imprisoned in a deer might form a Tie of fear toward predatory animals. The animal gains one of the spirit’s Defining Intimacies, and, at the Storyteller’s discretion, may become god-blooded. 

## Special activation rules

When the Lunar incapacitates a spirit of any [[Essence]] rating with Demon-Drinking Howl (p. XX), she may use this Charm to trap him inside an animal for a year and a day rather than destroying him. The spirit forms a Defining Tie of gratitude to the Lunar for her mercy, which he can’t erode until freed.
