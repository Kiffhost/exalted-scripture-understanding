*The Infernal is beyond what mortal senses can perceive, and only barely at the edge of the gods’ own ken.*

When the Infernal makes a Stealth roll, opposing rolls suffer a one-success penalty for each condition that applies:
- The Infernal intends to cause physical harm to someone during the current scene.
- The Infernal is within short range of the opposing character, or is pursuing him outside of combat.
- The Infernal has dealt decisive damage to the opposing character this scene.
- The opposing character is unable to see the Infernal, unable to hear her, or affected by [[Familiar Face Masquerade]].
