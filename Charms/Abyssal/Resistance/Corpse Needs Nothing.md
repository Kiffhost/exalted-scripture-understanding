*The Abyssal kills that in herself which requires mortal sustenance.*
The Abyssal no longer needs food or water to survive, and never suffers penalties from hunger or thirst.
However, she no longer finds pleasure in the taste of anything she does consume, imposing a −1 penalty on taste-based [[Perception]] rolls.
With a [[Resistance]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal no longer needs to sleep and never suffers fatigue penalties.
Instead of regaining [[Willpower]] from sleep, she gains one [[Willpower]] at the stroke of midnight.
With a [[Resistance]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal no longer needs to breathe, though she must still do so to speak. By stopping her breathing, she can avoid exposure to inhaled poisons and similar dangers entirely.
