*The Lunar seems nigh-omniscient to those that hunt her: Assassins feel their blood run chill as she cheerfully greets them; invisible devils flee the ferocious intensity of her gaze.*
When a character she’s unaware of comes within short range, she rolls to read his intentions. Success reveals his presence and location along with his current emotional state, and lets her reflexively make an influence roll targeting him, which he suffers −2 [[Resolve]] against. If the Lunar knows [[Perceiving the Hidden World]], she may use this Charm against dematerialized entities even while not using [[Perceiving the Hidden World]]. This Charm may only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully detecting a hidden character with it.
