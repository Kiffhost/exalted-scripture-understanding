The Azure [[Dawn]] Players are a famed troupe of traveling actors in the Hundred Kingdoms, performers to many of the region’s sundry princes and queens. Unbeknownst to their audience, the troupe is also a secret sect of White Veil stylists, using performances as a front for covert assassinations. They do so in the name of unifying the Hundred Kingdoms, the unrealized ambition of their long-ago founder, grandmaster Ondari Witherroot.
None among the troupe today realize that Ondari was one of Luna’s Chosen, but their nigh-religious devotion to her is no less for it.
The [[Shadow Moth Raiment]] is the troupe’s most sacred relic of Ondari. It’s a cape-like cloak of charcoal silk, embroidered with moths — her spirit shape — in moonsilver wire. None in the troupe today are able to attune to it; four strong players guard the ark that contains it at all times. They would fight to the last of them in the mantle’s defense, but might give it to one who can convince them that she’s Ondari Witherroot reborn. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the [[Shadow Moth Raiment]]
While attuned, black-winged moths occasionally fly forth from the Shadow Moth Raiment’s folds. Its [[Evocations]] mislead and misdirect enemies with deceptive movements, feints, and footwork, some using! the armor’s moths to do so. Martial artists can awaken [[Evocations]] that let them combine the armor’s themes with their fighting styles.
The raiment doesn’t count as armor for its compatibility with [[Martial Arts]].
