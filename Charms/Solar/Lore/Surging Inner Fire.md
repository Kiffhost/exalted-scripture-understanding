The stresses of mental violence draw power from the recesses of the Solar’s mind. Once per scene, the Solar may use this Charm to restore a number of motes based on her current temporary Willpower. For each permanent Willpower dot she possesses above her current temporary Willpower score, she gains two motes of Essence. When used in combat, this Charm adds an extra mote to the Solar’s per-round regeneration, upping it from five to six. This effect lasts until she is struck with an attack that does successful withering damage. This Charm is reset by earning three or more points of temporary Willpower through stunts, Charms, and so on.
