Long before armies and heroes clash on the field of battle, the strategies of their generals shape the conflict to come.

# Overview
This is how strategic conflict works: 
- The strategic decision-maker (generally a general or strategos) for each side decides upon a desired [[#Stratagems|stratagem]]. 
- The players of each involved general tally up any advantages they may have that would provide [[#Potential Modifiers|modifiers]] to their attempt to implement their strategy. 
- The players make an opposed ([[Intelligence]] + [[War]]) [[Strategic Warfare|Strategic Maneuver]] roll. If one side or the other manages to triumph, then the battle that follows plays out according to the terms of the stratagem they’ve selected. 
- The battle is then played out in the combat system as usual, subject to the selected stratagem.

# Stratagems
What follows is a list of potential stratagems. Each has a listed *threshold*—a number of successes by which the opponent’s [[Strategic Warfare|Strategic Maneuver]] roll must be exceeded in order to successfully implement the stratagem. If you roll more successes than your opponent, but fail to accumulate enough to implement your stratagem, then the battle simply occurs with no stratagem in place and no particular advantage accorded to either side.
