The Sidereal casts a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden at Sea into the air as she confronts an adversary or obstacle; the prayer strip hangs in the air, wreathed in dandelion-hued lightning. The Sidereal can use this Charm when confronted with any enemy, obstacle, or other threat to her safety or progress while aboard a ship or other vessel that travels sea or sky. She and any other Sidereals waive the Willpower cost to use Excellencies to reduce target numbers for rolls with any Ability. Non-Sidereals gain −1 target number on rolls to overcome the challenge. If the Sidereal and her allies defeat their enemies or prevail over a challenge, her prayer strip erupts into a conflagration of lightning, fire, and thunder, wreaking overwhelming destruction on nearby enemies, natural features, and other phenomena that comprise part of the challenge or are related to it. Defeating an enemy ship’s crew might decimate a fleet it belongs to; navigating through a storm could disperse it; a calm that’s stranded her ship gives way to a powerful wind driving her to her destination. This won’t kill nontrivial characters, though it may incapacitate them; the specifics of the destruction are up to the Storyteller. If the Sidereal is defeated or gives up or it becomes impossible to overcome the challenge, this Charm ends. She rolls (Essence) dice, losing Limit equal to her successes. Reset: Once per story.
