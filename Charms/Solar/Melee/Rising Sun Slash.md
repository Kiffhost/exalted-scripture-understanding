At the apex of her strike, the Solar channels an inexorable flow of offensive Essence through her weapon, increasing the speed and ferocity of her attack. This Charm is activated after an attack roll has been made, before a defense has been applied, and only when the Exalt uses a full Melee Excellency. If the attackâ€™s result contains at least one 7, 8, 9, and 10, add one non-Charm automatic success and roll (Essence) non-Charm dice.
