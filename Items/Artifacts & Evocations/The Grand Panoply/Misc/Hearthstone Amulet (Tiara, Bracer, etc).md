*A wide variety of decorative artifacts exist whose sole purpose is to provide a socket into which an attuned [[Merits/Hearthstone]] may be placed.*
The most common form of these artifacts are amulets wrought of the five magical materials, though [[Merits/Hearthstone]] bracers are nearly as popular, and some Chosen—particularly Sidereals—prefer circlets or tiaras which fix the [[Merits/Hearthstone]] in the center of their forehead, directly over their Caste Mark. All such items cost a single mote to attune.

If a character wears magical armor of the same material as a worn [[Merits/Hearthstone]] amulet (tiara, bracer, etc.), then the amulet’s socket is considered to be part of that armor for the purpose of dependent [[Merits/Hearthstone]]s (see p. 604).
