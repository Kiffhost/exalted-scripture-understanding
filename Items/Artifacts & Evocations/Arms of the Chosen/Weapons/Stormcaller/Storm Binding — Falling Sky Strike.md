Mastering the storm demon with nothing more than her own will, the wielder forces the devil-cursed blade back into its sheath, breaking the storm against her own fury. To use this Evocation, the wielder must be at [[Initiative]] 15+ and have raised the storm to Intensity 6+. The wielder diverts the normal consequences of sheathing [[Stormcaller]] into a devastating barrage of lightning. She makes (Intensity/2, round up) unblockable decisive attacks against one or more enemies out to extreme range, making a single attack roll. She divides (her [[Initiative]] + the storm’s Intensity) evenly among all hit enemies (round up) to determine the raw damage rolled against them, ignoring [[Hardness]]. The wielder adds the threshold successes she rolled over each target’s [[Defense]] as bonus dice of decisive damage against that target. This Evocation is subject to the same reset conditions as Storm Binding: Lightning Cleaves the Heavens. Once one is used, neither can be until the blade is purified. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
