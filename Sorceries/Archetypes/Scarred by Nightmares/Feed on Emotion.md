The sorcerer may feed on emotional energies like the raksha, shaping the passions of others through spellcraft. Once per scene, when another character forms, strengthens, or weakens an Intimacy that represents an emotional feeling, the sorcerer may feed from it, gaining sorcerous motes equal to the intensity of the Intimacy (its new rating if it was strengthened, or the old one if weakened). These motes last for the duration of the story, and can be spent towards any spell she casts. The fervent passions of the Exalted represented by Limit are even more potent nourishment. Whenever a character, including the sorcerer herself, gains a point of Limit, the sorcerer may draw power from that, gaining sorcerous motes equal to the characterâ€™s current Limit. She may draw ten sorcerous motes from a character in Limit Break, but only once during the duration of that Break.
