*Driven by death-dealing momentum, the Lunar overruns masses of lesser foes.*
After incapacitating an enemy with a decisive attack and resetting to base [[Initiative]], she reflexively makes a decisive attack against an opponent she hasn’t attacked that tick. If that attack overcomes her target’s [[Hardness]], she adds (her [[Initiative]] before resetting/2, rounded up) damage dice. Alternatively, when the Lunar reduces a battle group’s [[Size]] with a decisive attack, she may launch another decisive attack against it, as above. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Trample, if this Charm is triggered by an attack that benefited from that ability, the Lunar applies Trample’s benefits to all attacks made with [[Stampede-Force Strike]] that tick.
