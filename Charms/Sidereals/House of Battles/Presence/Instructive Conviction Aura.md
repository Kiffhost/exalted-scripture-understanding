Garnet light shines from the Sidereal’s mouth and hands, the undimmed radiance of herself. The Sidereal chooses a Major or Defining Intimacy. The radiance spilling forth from her causes all who see it to tell she has that Intimacy and grants the following benefits: 
-  Those who see her can use that Intimacy against social influence or for other purposes. If they gain Willpower from upholding it this way, the Sidereal also gains one Willpower. 
-  When another character makes an influence roll that aligns with the chosen Intimacy, he adds (Sidereal’s Charisma) dice. 
-  When she uses Impose Nature to instill the chosen Intimacy, the Charm’s cost is reduced by three motes and she adds (Essence) dice on the roll. 
-  If she uses Presence-in-Absence Technique to embed influence that aligns with the chosen Intimacy, her target can use that Intimacy, as above, and gains the bonus on influence rolls until he’s made the embedded influence. If the Sidereal’s Resolve is beaten by influence opposed by the chosen Intimacy, this Charm ends.
