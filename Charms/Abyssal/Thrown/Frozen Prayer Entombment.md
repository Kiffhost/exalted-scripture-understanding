*The deathknight infuses her weapons with a terrible cold that gradually freezes her victims in place.*
If the Abyssal deals 3+ decisive damage, her enemy suffers a −3 [[crippling]] penalty from the cold. This lasts until at least the end of the scene; after that, she must receive adequate medical treatment for hypothermia or rest until he’s healed all damage in his [[health track]] to remove the penalty.
Multiple uses of this Charm stack their penalties.
