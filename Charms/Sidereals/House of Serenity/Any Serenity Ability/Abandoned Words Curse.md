Chanting syllables that don’t quite form recognizable words in any language and whose broken rhythm never settles on a meter, the Sidereal untethers her listener from language. The Sidereal makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [Linguistics, [[Performance]], or Socialize]) instill roll against a single character. Success removes his knowledge of all languages, rendering him unable to employ or understand spoken or written communication. The victim may pay one [[Willpower]] to regain understanding of a single language for a scene. Once he’s done so (Sidereal’s [[Essence]]) times, this influence ends. Otherwise, it lasts until this Charm ends. With [[Essence]] 5, this Charm’s duration becomes Indefinite. 

## Special activation rules

When the Sidereal curses a character with [[Descending Serenity Horoscope]], she may use this Charm against him reflexively, reducing its cost to three motes, one [[Willpower]].
