A Lunar can take the shapes of mutated humans or animals, like beastfolk and Wyld mutants. She gains their Supernatural mutations in their forms but must commit additional motes equal to the total dot value of Supernatural mutations that form possesses. This doesnâ€™t apply to mutations granted to forms after the Lunar claims them.
