Eyes burning silver, the Lunar’s gaze pierces the barrier of possibility to usher in the doom waiting beyond. When she uses Far-Seeing Storm Crow, she may pay a thirty-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to introduce the fact that her target’s weakness will doom him in a coming challenge. The roll’s difficulty is (victim’s Essence), plus a modifier depending on the severity of the foretold doom: +0 for events causing serious complications for her victim, such as a debt-ridden merchant’s creditors calling in what he owes or a prideful tyrant facing opposition from a political rival; +3 for a severely dangerous peril, such as a merchant’s creditors sending hired thugs to violently coerce repayment or a covert attempt at poisoning a tyrant; or +5 for a life-altering catastrophe, such as a merchant being enslaved by his creditors or a mass rebellion breaking out in a tyrant’s kingdom. To enact her prediction, the Lunar must inform her victim of it — and how he might avert it, specifying a course of action that, if accomplished within (5 + his Integrity) days, will prevent the doom. By default, this can be no greater than an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216); she can specify a serious task with 3+ extra successes or a life-changing task with 6+ extra successes. Regardless of severity, the task must be one that the Storyteller deems the victim could feasibly complete within the allotted time span. The disaster is also averted if the Lunar releases her mote commitment prematurely, or goes a full day without reminding the target of the oncoming doom and the flaw that caused it. If this Charm’s victim can’t avert the foretold doom, it’s sure to happen. The specifics may vary from the Lunar’s prediction based on how events unfold in play, but her target will face a crisis of appropriate severity. However, he’s not assured to fail. Successful rolls, creative thinking, allies’ assistance, and other assets can mitigate the overall harm and impact of the crisis. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) by exploiting a character’s greatest flaw or convincing a character to overcome his greatest weakness.
