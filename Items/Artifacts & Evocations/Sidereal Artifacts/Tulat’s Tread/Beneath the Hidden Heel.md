*Acting on misguided compassion, Tulat imparts the gift of going unseen to another.*
The wielder makes a decisive attack, adding up to ([[Manipulation]]) extra successes as dice on the damage roll. If the damage dealt exceeds her target’s (higher of [[Essence]] or 3), he’s obscured from the world. He can’t be perceived or remembered by anyone for the rest of the scene, except by his enemies. This Psyche effect targets those other characters, not the victim himself. Characters can resist by entering a Decision Point and citing a Defining [[Intimacy]] to pay one [[Willpower]]. If the attack kills the target, this Psyche effect lingers for (wearer’s [[Essence]]) days. 
## Resonant
Trivial characters continue to be affected by this Evocation until the victim has healed all damage in his health track. 
## Dissonant
Characters need only cite a Major [[Intimacy]] to resist.
