Corrupt officials sow the seeds of their own downfall; the Sidereal hastens this appointed end. The Sidereal can pay a three-mote surcharge when she uses Icy Hand to also convey a poison that only affects the corrupt. It has Damage 1A/hour, Duration (Sidereal's successes) hours, and a –3 penalty. It's resisted with (Manipulation + Bureaucracy). Characters who've never engaged in corruption in the position they currently hold are immune to this. Targets must roll against the poison before the Sidereal's influence roll is compared to their Resolve.
