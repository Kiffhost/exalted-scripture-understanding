*With speed and grace, the Exalt flashes to her own [[defense]].*
Even when she is beleaguered she strikes away blows with preternatural accuracy. The Solar can ignore all penalties to parry an attack with her full [[Defense]]. In addition, any attack she successfully parries with Dipping Swallow [[Defense]] grants her one point of [[Initiative]]. This Charm cannot by itself remove the penalties from a surprise attack.
