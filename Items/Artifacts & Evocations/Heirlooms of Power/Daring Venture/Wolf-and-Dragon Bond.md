This Evocation upgrades [[Mother-of-Beasts Mastery]] (p. 271). When the Dragon-Blood uses it to train [[HUNDRED RIVERS, THE WANDERING WOLF|Hundred Rivers]], the time required is halved, and she waives the experience point cost of awakening his magical abilities. Any experience she’s already spent doing so is refunded upon awakening this Evocation. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience points. It awakens at no cost when the wielder risks her life or undergoes great hardship to defend, heal, or otherwise help Hundred Rivers.
