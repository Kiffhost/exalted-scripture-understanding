## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by a wielder resonant with moonsilver. Once the Exalt is incapacitated, her Essence merges more fully with the blade than ever before. Arise, Moonlight Blade activates for free if not currently active. For the rest of the scene, Flying Silver Dream cannot be crashed — anything that would reduce its Initiative value to 0 or below merely drops it to 1. Its temporary Willpower resets to 10, it gains a full Peripheral Essence pool equal to the wielder’s, and it gains access to all of its wielder’s Charms that could enhance actions the daiklave is capable of taking, other than those wholly inappropriate for a flying sword. If the Exalt dies, the effect lingers for as long as the Storyteller deems dramatically appropriate. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by defeating the foe who incapacitated her or making peace with him after forming a positive Major or Defining Tie towards him. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset it. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the Exalt is incapacitated.
