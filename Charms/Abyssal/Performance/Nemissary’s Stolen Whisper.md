*The Abyssal’s vocal mimicry is uncanny, mocking her victims with the words of their loved ones.*
The Abyssal perfectly mimics the voice of anyone she’s spent at least an hour observing or interacting with. Each use of this Charm covers a single influence roll or up to ten seconds of speech.
With a [[Performance]] 5 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a two-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene, letting her flawlessly mimic a single person’s voice.
