As fog or clouds touch the seas, the sorcerer speaks honeyed lies to a ship, convincing it that it may sail forward upon them. The enchanted ship may sail over mist, fog, or other vapors as though they were water, and can ascend vertically through such vapors until it’s skimming over their surface. In sufficiently misty environs, it’s even possible for the ship to rise high enough to sail on the clouds themselves. However, while vapor-borne, the ship cannot benefit from Speed bonuses from oars or currents. If this spell ends, or there’s no vapor left for the ship to sail on, it descends, landing safe and undamaged, albeit potentially landlocked. 

A sorcerer with this as her control spell is constantly wreathed by pale mists, though she may disperse them with a thought unless distracted by involved activity, deep contemplation, or tumultuous emotion. She may walk on mist or fog as though it were solid ground, albeit as difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199). 
# Distortion 
(Goal Number: 8)
Distorting this spell causes mist to envelop the ship in a thick cloud, making it all but impossible for its crew to see outward. Sail rolls to pilot it suffer a −3 penalty, and those aboard have no warning if it’s about to run out of mist that can support it.
