The Dragon-Blood’s soldiers brace themselves to hold the line, fortified with the strength of mountains by her command. When an allied battle group within short range of the Dragon-Blood is attacked, she may reflexively roll a special command action with ([Charisma, Appearance, or Intelligence] + War). Every two successes on her roll add +1 to the battle group’s Defense and soak against the attack. This Charm can only be used once per scene unless reset by successfully rallying or rallying for numbers. At Essence 5+, the Dragon-Blooded can extend this Charm’s range to medium for an additional two motes.
