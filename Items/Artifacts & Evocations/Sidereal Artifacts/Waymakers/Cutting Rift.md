The Waymakers wound space itself, cutting open a portal to strike at distant foes. The wielderâ€™s attack can strike out to short range and ignores light and heavy cover. Full cover remains impassable. With Essence 2, the wielder can attack out to medium range, but requires an aim action to do so. 

## Resonant

The wielder can cut open larger portals that obviate the need for precision, letting her attack through full cover. However, it grants +3 non-Charm Defense against her attack.
