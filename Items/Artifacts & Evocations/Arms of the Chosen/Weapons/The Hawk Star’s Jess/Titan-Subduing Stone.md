Like the gigantes and behemoths of times past, the Exalt’s foes are fated to fall. Whenever the Exalt activates [[Doom-Gathering Arc]] against an opponent of Legendary [[Size]], she ignores the limit that Merit imposes on damage and rerolls (Doom) failed damage dice, starting with 1s and counting upward. 

## Dissonant

The wielder doesn’t reroll failed damage dice.
