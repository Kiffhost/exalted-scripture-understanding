Instinctive Unity Approach The Lunar manifests her spirit shape as a divine beast, a moon-graced familiar born of her Exaltation.
The Lunar manifests her spirit shape as a familiar to fight alongside her, paying five motes per dot of its Familiar rating and one Willpower. The manifested spirit shape uses its normal animal traits, but Tiny Creature and Minuscule Size don’t reduce its damage.
It has a defining Tie of loyalty to the Lunar, and any of her Intimacies that are compatible with its level of intelligence.
The spirit shape has all latent and magical abilities listed with its traits, and any latent or magical abilities the Lunar has trained other familiars in, as long as they’re physically compatible with the spirit shape’s body.
The spirit shape gains the benefits of Blessed MoonBeast Empowerment, and any of Erudite Beast-Mind Expansion and Witch-Beast Ascendancy that the Lunar knows. Witch-Beast Ascendancy also conveys all Terrestrial Spells known by the Lunar. If the Lunar has Eternal Companion Endurance, the familiar gains the benefits of (Lunar’s Essence) purchases.
The divine beast’s arrival rallies the Lunar’s other familiars. Each of them rolls Join Battle and gains one Willpower.


## Special activation rules

The Lunar can use Supreme God-Beast Unleashed reflexively with this Charm to enhance the familiar. Its anima and Willpower costs are waived.
