The Abyssal can use this Charm after landing a decisive attack against an enemy afflicted with [[Frozen Prayer Entombment]]. She can end that Charm’s penalty to add an automatic success on the damage roll, and can add up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) successes total by canceling stacked penalties from multiple uses. If the attack was an ambush, she doesn’t have to end the penalty to add damage.
