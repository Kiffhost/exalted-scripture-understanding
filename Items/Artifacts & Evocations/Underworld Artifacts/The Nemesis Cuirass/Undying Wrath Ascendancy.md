*The armor whispers to its master to sacrifice all that she is at the altar of victory.*
The wearer can take a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201) by sacrificing a positive Tie or a Principle expressing compassion or ethical principles instead of suffering maiming. This negates ([[Intimacy]] + 1) levels of damage. She can’t sacrifice an [[Intimacy]] whose intensity is greater than that of her strongest negative Tie that’s relevant to the fight. She can’t regain the sacrificed [[Intimacy]] by any means until the end of the story.
## Resonant
If the wearer has a negative Defining Tie that’s relevant to the fight, this doesn’t count against the once-per-story limit for crippling injuries. She can’t use it more than once per scene.
