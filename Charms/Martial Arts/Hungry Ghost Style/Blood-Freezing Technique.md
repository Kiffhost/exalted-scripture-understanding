*The stylist inflicts the chill of the grave, sending it racing through her victim’s veins.*
The stylist can use this Charm when a withering attack deals enough damage to reduce an enemy’s Initiative from being higher than hers to lower, afflicting him with an eerie chill for the rest of the scene. He suffers a −1 penalty on physical rolls, which increases to −3 on movement actions and other rolls where speed is vital. The chill grows strongest when her victim tries to move away from her, forcing him to disengage regardless of the distance between them.
### Terrestrial
The stylist can only use this Charm when she crashes an enemy.
