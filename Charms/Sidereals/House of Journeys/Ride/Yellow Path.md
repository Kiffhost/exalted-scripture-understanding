*The Sidereal sees the shortest path to her goal illumined by a glimmering yellow trail of stardust.*
While traveling along the path revealed by this Charm the Sidereal, her Circlemates, and up to ([[Essence]]) others double the speed at which they travel and gain −1 target number on rolls to forage, find shelter, overcome obstacles, or endure [[environmental hazards]] along the way. There’s no guarantee this path will be safe or easy; the Storyteller should choose whatever route and difficulties are best suited to the story. If the Sidereal has a deadline to get somewhere, she can roll ([[Essence]] + [[Ride]]), unmodified by any other effects, to make it on time. The roll’s difficulty is 5 if the Sidereal has any chance of making it on time, or 10 otherwise. She can’t use this Charm more than once per deadline. This Charm is compatible with all forms of movement, not just mounted travel.
