*A halo of elemental power radiates from the stylist’s blow, her Essence embodying the rarefied substance of Creation.*
The stylist’s attack gains one of the following benefits:
### Black Jade (Water)
Moving with the fluidity of black jade, the attack inflicts its onslaught penalty before the attack roll and ignores Defense bonuses from light and heavy cover and the full defense action.
### Blue Jade (Air)
Striking with the swiftness and precision of blue jade, the stylist adds (Lore or Occult) dice on an attack roll. Its onslaught penalty is increased by one.
### Green Jade (Wood)
Imbuing her attack with the vitality of green jade, the stylist heals a level of non-aggravated damage if she crashes or deals 3+ levels of decisive damage to an enemy.
### Red Jade (Fire)
Channeling the destructive power of red jade, the stylist adds (Lore or Occult) to the raw damage and Overwhelming of a withering attack or adds up to (Essence) attack roll extra successes as decisive damage dice.
### White Jade (Earth)
Embodying the stability of white jade, the stylist adds (Essence, maximum 5) to the Initiative awarded for crashing an enemy with a withering attack or adds half that value, rounded up, to her base Initiative after a decisive attack.
The stylist can use this Charm multiple times to enhance the same attack with different effects.
