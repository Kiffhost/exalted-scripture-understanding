Reciting holy texts or heartfelt words, the Exalt returns a corpse to nature. She may burn a mortal’s corpse to ashes inafewseconds,ensuringthedeceased’slowersoulwon’t linger in the world as a hungry ghost. An existing hungry ghost is unaffected, though the destruction of its corpse requiresittofindanewplaceitcanspendthedaywithout being destroyed by sunlight (Exalted, pp. 503-504). This rite provides emotional catharsis to the deceased’s ghost, allowing it to abandon its undead existence and enter the cycle of reincarnation if it chooses. Even if it doesn’t, the ritual appeases it, causing it to form a positive Minor Tie towards the Dragon-Blood that cannot be fully removed until the story’s end.
