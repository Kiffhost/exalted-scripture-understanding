Composite bows are made of layers of different woods, often reinforced with layers of horn. This reinforced construction gives them more power in a smaller size— like the [[self bow]], they’re about three feet long. The only weakness of a composite bow, other than its expense, is that it’s held together with glue. If it becomes wet, the glue weakens, and the bow can come to pieces. As a result, most composite bows are bound in waterproof leather covers, and very few cultures native to humid climes make common use of them.
