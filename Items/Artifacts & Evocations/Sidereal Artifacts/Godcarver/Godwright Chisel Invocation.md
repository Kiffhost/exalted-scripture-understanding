Godcarver brings forth the divinity trapped in the stone, creating a temple like the egg of a newborn god. 

## Resonant

Only characters resonant with Godcarver can awaken this Evocation. The wielder undertakes a mundane superior project to create a magnificent temple to a god that does not exist. The wielder determines the general nature of the god, but not its position in the Celestial Bureaucracy. If she created a god of purifying flame, it would have miracles appropriate to that role, but no official status or recognition of such. The construction gains the benefits of Temple-Consecrating Talent for free. Signs and portents of the god-to-be appear nearby as the wielder labors. For the god of purifying flame, children might recite rhymes about the wicked world reduced to ash, while rotten trees spontaneously combust. Spirits sense the coming of a new divinity, though not the temple’s precise location. Upon completing the project, the wielder makes one final blow with Godcarver to free the newborn divinity from its stone egg. The craft points for completing the project are doubled (Exalted, pp. 241, 243). The god has the following: 
- An Essence rating of (wielder’s Essence − 2). 
- 50 + (Essence x 2) personal motes. 
- Materialize and Hurry Home (Exalted, p. 509-510), and (its Essence + 3) other spirit Charms appropriate to its nature or Evocations of the temple. Not all these Charms need to be chosen when the spirit is created; they can be left undetermined and selected later. 
The god’s other traits are left to the Storyteller to devise together with the wielder’s player. Sidereals with Willing Assumption of Chains (p. XX) can confer its benefits on the god for free. Gods created by Solars with Ephemeral Induction Technique (Exalted, p. 360) have Essence equal to theirs and count as familiars, though not subject to that Charm’s limit on them.
