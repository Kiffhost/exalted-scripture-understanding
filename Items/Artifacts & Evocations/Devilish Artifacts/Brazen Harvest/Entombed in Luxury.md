*Each caress of Brazen Harvest buries its victims in wealth.*

Damaging an armored enemy increases his armor’s mobility penalty by one. Clothing is also transformed, even if worn under armor, inflicting a −1 penalty on influence rolls where being well-dressed is relevant. These penalties stack, up to a maximum of −3.

Mundane armor requires a basic repair project to clear away the overgrowth, while mundane clothing is ruined beyond repair. Artifacts need only a few minutes of cleaning.

If the wielder incapacitates an enemy affected by this Evocation, she may reflexively activate Overflowing Abundance on his armor, waiving its Willpower cost. Mundane armor used as a seedbed is destroyed, while artifact armor is damaged severely enough to require repairs.
