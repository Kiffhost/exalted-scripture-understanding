Breathing deep, the Immaculate fills her lungs with liquid Essence. With a mighty, bellowing kiai, she expels a rumbling torrent of spiritual pressure. To use this Charm, she must have Initiative 20+. She rolls an unblockable decisive attack with (Stamina + Martial Arts) against all enemies in a ninety-degree arc out to medium range. If she’s using Ghost-Restraining Whirlpool, its currents bear the force of her attack to strike all spirits within its range, materialized or dematerialized. This attack deals bashing damage to each struck enemy equal to ([Attack roll threshold successes x his wound penalty] + 1), ignoring Hardness. Battle groups are treated as having a −4 wound penalty to determine damage. This doesn’t include the Immaculate’s Initiative or reset her to base. Each enemy damaged by the attack is flung one range band away from the Immaculate and falls prone. Spirits cannot be forced outside the range of a Ghost-Restraining Whirlpool, and instead suffer damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232) if driven to the whirlpool’s edge. An enemy that takes 3+ levels of damage is knocked back two range bands and suffers damage as per a short-range fall (or medium range, for spirits forced against a Ghost-Restraining Whirlpool’s edge). Tsunami-Force Shout can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Immaculate’s Initiative and building back to Initiative 20+.
