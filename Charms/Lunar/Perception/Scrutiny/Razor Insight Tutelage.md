*The Lunar witch-sage is a harsh mentor, providing guidance through trials and tribulations.*
After exploiting a weakness revealed by [[Soul-Piercing Predator Gaze]] to defeat a character in some area of endeavor, she makes a reflexive ({Appearance or Charisma} + {Performance, [[Presence]], or Socialize}) persuade roll, adding ([[Perception]]) non-Charm dice. The character is treated as having an [[Intimacy]] that supports the Lunar’s influence, with an intensity based on the severity of his defeat: 
- Minor: The target willingly surrendered or fled, was unable to protect a Minor [[Intimacy]], lost assets or prestige equivalent to 1-2 dots of [[Merits]], etc. 
- Major: The target suffered a crippling injury or was reduced to his −4 health levels, was unable to protect a Major [[Intimacy]], was prevented from achieving a major character or storygoal, lost prestige or assets equivalent to 3-4 dots of [[Merits]], etc. 
- Defining: The target was incapacitated, was unable to protect a Defining [[Intimacy]], was prevented from achieving a legendary social goal, lost prestige or assets equivalent to 5+ dots of [[Merits]], etc.
Success convinces the character to undertake a task that will help him to overcome his weakness, compensate for it, or undo its causes. 
This Charm can’t be used against a character more than once per story. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar’s target has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to her current shape that supports her influence, treat its intensity as one step greater. If it’s already Defining, the influence costs an additional [[Willpower]] to resist instead.
