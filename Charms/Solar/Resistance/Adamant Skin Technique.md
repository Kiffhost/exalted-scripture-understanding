Driven by purpose, the Solar refuses to be defeated. Channeling [[Essence]] through her [[Resistance]], she may apply her full ([[Stamina]] + armor soak) to a decisive attack. As this Charm is a counter to decisive attacks, the weapon’s overwhelming damage does not apply without a Charm. This effect is incompatible with [[Charms]] that increase soak except for [[Diamond-Body Prana]], and [[Adamant Skin Technique]] can’t be invoked against an ambush attack; however, it grants total immunity to scenery-based uncountable damage, allowing the Solar to escape seemingly-impossible recurring damage, like that of an explosion or a collapse, or falling from a great height. Such impacts still daze the Solar, knocking the wind from her, and giving her a -3 penalty for (7 - [[Stamina]], minimum of 1) turns. Invoking [[Adamant Skin Technique]] sets the Solar’s hardness to 0 for one instant.
