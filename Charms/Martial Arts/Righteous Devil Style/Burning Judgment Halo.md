*Those who’d raise a hand against the Righteous Devil must walk through the fire of their own iniquities to do so.* 
Pointing the tip of her firewand at the ground, the stylist draws the [[Burning Judgment Halo]], a ring of flames that encompasses all characters at close range to her, with the traits of a bonfire (p. 230). It is not necessary to create the full circle of flame—if the stylist is standing between a brutal slaver and his victims, she may choose to create only a semi-circle of fire, for example. The flames created by this Charm will continue to burn for as long as the Righteous Devil remains at their center. Once she takes a movement action to move from that point, they will continue to burn for a single round more, then die down on her next turn. Moving through the blaze created by this Charm never damages the stylist—the devil walks through hell unscathed. 
## Terrestrial
The fires created by this Charm only last until the Dragon-Blood’s next turn, unless she pays an additional four [[Initiative]] to renew it at the start of each of her turns.
