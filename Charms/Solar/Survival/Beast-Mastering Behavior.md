*The Solar holds dominion over the beasts of the field.*
With this Charm she can train an animal, familiar or otherwise, to follow her commands. Through exercise and repeated practice, she can also train the beast to use special abilities that are latent, such as an eagle’s disarm ability (p. 563), or techniques designed by the player or the Storyteller which are appropriate to the animal. Normally, training an animal to unlock its latent potential requires a minimum of [[Survival]] 3, and two specialties: one in animal husbandry, and another specific to the animal—falconry for a hawk, lion taming for a great cat, and so on. The trainer makes an extended roll with an interval of one month and a goal of 10, modified by the animal’s attitude—docile and tamed beasts presenting no penalties, familiars representing a number of bonus dice equal to the trainer’s [[Intimacy]] to the animal, and hostile, wild, or otherwise untrainable animals representing a penalty of -2 or -3. The trainer must spend the entire month interacting with the beast, teaching it words, signals, commands, and running it through exercises daily. Any significant amount of time the trainer spends away from the beast during this time saps successes away at a rate of one success for every two or three days. Success at the extended roll means that the animal learns to use the technique and can be order to do so on command.
