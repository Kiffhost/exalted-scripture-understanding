The Lunar trails pheromones like heady perfume, beguiling and distracting pursuers. When she takes a conceal evidence or conceal tracks action, she also makes an (Appearance + Presence) instill roll with (Appearance) bonus dice to create a Tie toward herself (or her current shape). Characters casing the scene or tracking her must first contend with this influence. A character whose Resolve is beaten suffers a −(Lunar’s Essence) penalty and his 1s subtract successes, even if he spends Willpower to resist.
