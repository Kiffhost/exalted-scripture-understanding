Skulking Rat Spirit The Lunar slips away from her foes with a well-timed transformation.
When the Lunar uses Quicksilver Second Face and makes a Stealth roll on the same tick, characters whose Initiative is lower than hers suffer a −3 penalty on their rolls against her Stealth. Characters who weren’t aware the Lunar could shapeshift also suffer this penalty.
Penalized characters who fail their roll lose 1 Initiative.

## Protean 
Shifting into a shape with Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size lets the Lunar roll Stealth to enter concealment without needing a hiding place.
