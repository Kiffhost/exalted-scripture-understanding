Channeling pure Fire Essence to stoke her spirit’s fervor and her body’s speed, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a furious series of blows that blister the air and fell her foes. She makes ([higher of Dexterity or Strength]/2, rounded down) decisive attacks, divided among one or more enemies. If she has an applicable Melee specialty, she adds it to the relevant Attribute to determine how many attacks she makes. Each attack has a base damage equal to (Initiative/2, rounded up), and she doesn’t reset to base Initiative until she’s completed all attacks. If she uses any non-Excellency Fire Charms to enhance these attacks, she need only pay their cost once. Harnessed Firestorm Assault can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully landing a decisive attack while in Fire Aura and building up to Initiative 12+ without leaving Fire Aura.
