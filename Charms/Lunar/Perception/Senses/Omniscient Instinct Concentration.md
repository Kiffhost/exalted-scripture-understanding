*Standing at the center of the changing seasons, the Lunar scents distant strife on the wind, reads portents written in the stars, and discerns secret wisdom from her dreams.*
When an event occurs within ([[Essence]] x100) miles that threatens or strongly impacts the object of one of the Lunar’s Defining Ties, or her Solar mate, she may spend one [[Willpower]] to focus her senses on the distant event, receiving a brief description of it as well as the direction and distance to it. Any [[Survival]] rolls she makes to navigate her way toward the event’s location double 7s. While [[Watchful Spider Stance]] is active, the Lunar can sense such events at any range, as long as she’s within the same realm of existence. The Lunar can always sense the death or reincarnation of her Solar mate with this Charm, regardless of range or being in a different realm of existence, and without needing to spend [[Willpower]].
