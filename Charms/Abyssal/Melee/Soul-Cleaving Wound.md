*The Abyssal’s weapon maims spirit and flesh alike.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after making a decisive damage roll, letting her forgo levels of damage to inflict one or more of the effects below. She must still deal at least one level of damage.
Conviction-Maiming Strike (1 level): The Abyssal wounds her victim’s higher soul as a Psyche effect.
Any Intimacies he has that aren’t based on emotion count as one step weaker. If he doesn’t have any, he loses one [[Willpower]] instead.
[[Essence]]-Bleeding Cut (3 levels): The Abyssal scars her victim’s very [[Essence]], causing him to lose motes equal to the damage roll’s successes. He treats his [[Essence]] as one lower for magic that uses it in calculations, and reduces the number of motes he regains each round in combat or each hour outside of it by one. He reduces them both by two instead while suffering a –2 or higher wound or crippling penalty.
Enemies without mote pools instead fall unconscious for the rest of the scene.
Will-Devouring Edge (3 levels): The Abyssal’s victim loses a point of [[Willpower]] and a dot of permanent [[Willpower]]. If this reduces his permanent [[Willpower]] to 0, he falls unconscious for the rest of the scene. The first time he spends [[Willpower]] in a scene, he must pay an additional point, and he can’t recover [[Willpower]] from rest..
Passion-Severing Slash (1 level): The Abyssal maims her victim’s lower soul as a Psyche effect. Any Intimacies he has that are based on emotion count as one step weaker. If he doesn’t have any, he loses one [[Willpower]] instead.
For most characters, these spiritual wounds require magic to heal, often [[Medicine]] or [[Occult]] [[Charms]].
Characters with [[Exalted Healing]] recover from them after a full day of convalescence.
