Using her defense to divert her attacker’s weapon or limbs, the Mantis stylist creates an opening in his guard. She gains +1 Parry, and inflicts a −1 onslaught penalty on her attacker if she successfully blocks. If she’s grappling, successfully blocking an attack also prevents it from reducing her rounds of control. 
## Mastery

The stylist doesn’t suffer an onslaught penalty from an attack she successfully blocks.
