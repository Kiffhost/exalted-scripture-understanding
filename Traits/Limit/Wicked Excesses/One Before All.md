Duration: Session
---
The Infernal has no peers, and has no time to coddle her inferiors. She pursues her goals with utmost selfishness, cynically exploiting her allies and acquaintances to further her agenda and paying no heed to objections. She will unapologetically steal and cheat to get what she wants and avoid rendering even the most trivial assistance to others. Her positive Ties are suppressed for the duration.

**Duration**: Session.
One Before All can be ended prematurely if the Infernal suffers material harm as a consequence of alienating her allies.
