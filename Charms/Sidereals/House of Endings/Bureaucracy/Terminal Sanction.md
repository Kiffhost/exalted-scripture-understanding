*The Sidereal formally invokes her divine authority as she makes the Lesser Sign of the Haywain against a spirit, binding it into a form she can attack and kill.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) against the [[Resolve]] of a spirit or other dematerialized character within medium range, adding (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) bonus dice against enemies of fate (p. XX). If she succeeds, that character materializes at no cost and can’t dematerialize for the rest of the scene. With [[Bureaucracy]] 3, if the Sidereal kills a spirit under this Charm’s effect, she determines the ending he meets. She can destroy him permanently, seal him away within a nearby object until it is destroyed, or bind him to her service, imposing a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty that lasts a year and a day and can’t be weakened or changed. With a [[Bureaucracy]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to apply this effect against all targets within medium range.
