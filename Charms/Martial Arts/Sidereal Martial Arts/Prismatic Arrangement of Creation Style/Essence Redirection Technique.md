Using gentle touches to divert the Essence flowing through an attack, the stylist channels its power into her own. When a lower-Initiative enemy attacks the stylist, she may cancel a single non-Excellency Supplemental or Reflexive Charm or Evocation with an Instant duration enhancing the attack. This Charm must ordinarily be declared before the attack is rolled but can be used after the attack roll to negate a Charm declared after the roll. If the stylist clashes the attack or makes a counterattack against it, she can pay the negated effect’s cost to apply it to her clash or counterattack. She can do so even if that effect isn’t normally compatible with Martial Arts, but it must otherwise make sense for it to enhance her attack. Enlightenment: The stylist doesn’t need to pay the cost of the negated effect to apply it to her clash attack or counterattack. The Scripture of Essence Once, there were maidens… and their names were Treasure and Power, and Heaven and Earth. The last maiden’s name was Divinity. These were their names, but they knew them not.
