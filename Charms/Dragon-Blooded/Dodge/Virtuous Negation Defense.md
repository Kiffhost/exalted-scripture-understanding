The Dragon-Blood twists to interpose herself between an ally and an incoming attack to guide it off course. When an ally within close range of her is attacked, she may interpose her Evasion against that single attack as though with a defend other action (Exalted, p. 196). When used to protect one of the Dragon-Blood’s Sworn Kin, this Charm costs only two motes. In Wood Aura, the Dragon-Blood may protect an ally within short range once per round, reflexively moving one range band to cover him. This doesn’t count as her movement action for the round.
