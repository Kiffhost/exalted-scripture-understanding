*Death’s Lawgiver savors the cries of night-beasts and the fragrance of blooming nightshade, wise in the ways of red-toothed nature.*
The Abyssal can use Survival specialties as Lore backgrounds to challenge or introduce facts, substituting Survival for Lore when she does. She doesn’t need a specialty for facts closely related to her backstory or experiences, like the flora and fauna of the city she lives in.
The Abyssal doubles 9s if the fact involves predatory animals, poisonous plants, or other morbid aspects of nature or if it involves shadowlands, the Underworld, or the undead. She doubles 8s if it involves both.
