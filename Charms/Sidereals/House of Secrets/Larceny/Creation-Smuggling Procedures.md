*The Sidereal reveals hidden strands of green phosphorescence twined around her fingers, weaving her surroundings into fate.*
The Sidereal and everything within short range of her are immune to the effects of Wyld exposure. The environment within that area follows Creation’s physical laws — e.g., gravity won’t spontaneously revert directions or become a liquid, though this doesn’t impede fae magic that alters reality. If the Sidereal renews this Charm when its duration ends, she waives its Willpower cost.
