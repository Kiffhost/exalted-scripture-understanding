The Sidereal performs a funereal ritual for herself, formally registering her death with the Division of Endings and joining the rolls of the dead. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  She’s considered undead by magical effects if this would be beneficial for her. This doesn’t render her an enemy of fate or a creature of darkness. 
-  She doesn’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. 
-  She adds (highest Endings Ability) dice on rolls with any Ability against disease, poison, or necromancy. 
-  The undead recognize her as one of their own and count as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of familiarity to her. Trivial undead can’t attack her. With an Any Endings Ability 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can perform a funeral for another character to confer this Charm’s benefits on him. She can grant this benefit to multiple characters; the cost of uses past the first is reduced to one mote.
