*Hell walks with the wicked, exposing their misdeeds to the Infernal’s harsh judgment.*

When the Infernal makes a profile character roll against someone who’s committed a crime or misdeed within the last hour, that character suffers −1 Guile. The Infernal doesn’t need to be aware of the offense. If she succeeds on a roll against such a character, his movements over the last hour are revealed, as footsteps of silver sand appear, tracing back his path. He continues to leave footprints of sand for (Infernal’s Essence) hours.

If circumstances require a roll with any Ability to notice the footprints or follow the trail, characters add two non-Charm successes. The footprints remain for at least (Infernal’s Essence) hours, even under conditions where this would normally be impossible. They reform if swept away, though appropriate magic can permanently dissipate them. The footsteps only show where the suspect actually stepped — they wouldn’t reveal the path a culprit took while swimming, for example.

The suspect continues Alternatively, the Infernal can curse a suspect to leave footprints of sand behind wherever he walks for the next (Essence), as above. She can do so even if he hasn’t committed a crime, as long as she suspects he’s committed some misdeed.
## [[Keys]]
#### Sinner-Scouring Condemnation
The Infernal curses her target even if hasn’t committed a crime. The suspect continues leaving footsteps of sand for (Infernal’s Essence + Perception) days.
#### Unwitting Confession Stride (Investigation 4, Essence 2)
If the Infernal’s roll revealed any information about the suspect’s crimes or misdeeds, she may cause his footprints to spell out whatever secrets she uncovered. A roll may be needed to notice this, receiving the benefits above. She can’t use this key when she uses [[Sand-Writ Exodus]] to reveal past movements.
