*In the latter years of the Shogunate, Kaito Owari — that infamous plunderer of tombs and lost cities — sought to loot the Valley of Golden Needles, the legendary kingdom smothered beneath a curse of endless mist.*
He [[THE PEACHES OF IMMORTALITY]] Grown in the gardens of Yu-Shan, these peaches are fabled for their youth-restoring efficacy. A peach is eaten in three bites. For most characters, including mortals and Dragon-Blooded, each bite undoes ten years of aging, while eating a whole peach restores them to their physical prime. For the long-lived Solar, Lunar, and [[Sidereal Exalted]], a single bite undoes a century of age, while an entire peach undoes a millennium. This will never revert a character back before the physical prime of youth. Note that while Sidereals can reclaim youth with these peaches, they cannot outlive their allotted span. (Exalted, p. 34). commissioned [[Mistweaver]] to aid him in this venture, and it did its work well. He returned from his first two ventures with priceless relics of ancient times and trophies of marvelous beasts, but he never returned from his third. Historians speculate that Owari crossed paths with No Key, the legendary Mushroom King, and met his end thereby. After Owari’s disappearance, the blade resurfaced centuries after the Contagion in the hands of Lady Ermine, the dreaded one-eyed Northern reaver, who used its power to master the deadly freezing fogs of the White Sea coast. Ermine terrorized cities from the Saltspires to Grieve for a decade, taking merchant ships as prizes and ransacking many a port while evading or defeating every mercenary and pirate-hunter sent against her. Her reign was only ended by the devious Realm dragonlord Peleps Mizu, who has since made the sword’s legend her own. The sword is jet black but for its edge, which gleams ultramarine from blue jade worked into the alloy. Coils of fog perpetually cascade from the blade. These form only a few thin swirls in the desert heat, but thicken in cold maritime air until the blade is invisible beneath its cloak of mist. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Mistweaver]]

While the Exalt bears [[Mistweaver]], obscuring manifestations of water cannot cloud her senses. She can see right through heavy fog, hear clearly amid a downpour, and feel the prickle of danger on her skin beneath a turbulent sea. Many of Mistweaver’s [[Evocations]] benefit from watery concealment — water-based obscurement sufficient to impose [[Awareness]] penalties. The Exalt suffers no penalties from watery concealment. Once per turn as a reflexive action, the Exalt can carve an opening through watery concealment: either a clearing out to close range, or a path out to short range. The cut edges remain intact until the end of her next turn, after which the vapor, turbidity or precipitation flows back at a natural rate. For cloudy or turbid water, only the obscurement is cut away, not the water itself. At [[Essence]] 3+, carved borders remain intact until end of scene as long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with jade.
