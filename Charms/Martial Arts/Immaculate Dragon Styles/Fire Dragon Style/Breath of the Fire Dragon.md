The Immaculate ignites the air within her lungs, expelling it as a mighty gout of flame. She rolls an unblockable decisive attack with (Stamina + Martial Arts) against all characters, including allies, in a ninety-degree arc out to close range, plus an additional range band for every 10 Initiative she has, to a maximum of medium range with 20+ Initiative. This attack strikes both dematerialized and materialized characters with (Initiative/3, rounded up) lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. Trivial opponents and battle groups suffer (Initiative) damage instead. If at least one enemy is hit by the attack, the Immaculate resets to base Initiative. Enemies that take 3+ levels of damage catch fire, suffering (Essence) dice of lethal damage each turn, ignoring Hardness, until extinguished. Dematerialized spirits suffer aggravated damage and are made visible to all by the flame as long as it burns, and cannot extinguish it unless they first materialize. Flammable scenery caught in the blast catches fire, burning as a bonfire (Damage 4L/round, Difficulty 5) for the rest of the scene. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 15+ Initiative on a single tick.
