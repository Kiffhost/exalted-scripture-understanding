The Lawgiver has an instinct for the perfect moments to commit a crime. Any time the Larceny Ability is used in her presence, she notices the character using it. This does not tell her how Larceny is being employed, but provides her (Essence) non-Charm dice to an Awareness or Investigation attempt to notice the deception for one instant, on each instant the Ability is employed. This only functions against disguises if the disguised character attempts an action he would be unable to attempt without using a disguise.
