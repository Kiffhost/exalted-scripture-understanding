*The Solar can inspire zealous devotion, even in the beasts of the wilderness.*
Conveying her wishes to her familiar through a brief command, the Solar orders her companion to attempt an action of which it is capable. Roll the Exalt’s ([[Charisma]] + [[Survival]]) and add her successes as dice to the familiar’s attempt to follow the Solar’s order. Unlike normal Simple [[Charms]], this Charm may be placed in a flurry. At [[Essence]] 3+, this Charm can be used reflexively.
