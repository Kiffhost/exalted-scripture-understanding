*Deflecting an attack with one hand, the martial artist uses the turning force of her attacker’s blow to grab him with the other.*
She clashes an attack from close range with a grapple gambit. Winning the clash adds (higher of [[Strength]] or 3) non-Charm dice on the clinch’s control roll. 
## Terrestrial
This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round, and can’t be used if she’s already attacked in this round.
