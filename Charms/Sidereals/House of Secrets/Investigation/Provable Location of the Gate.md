*Details Performing certain esoteric measurements, mathematical calculations, and intuitive deductions, the Sidereal proves that the wandering Calibration Gate will appear as she predicts.*
The Sidereal makes an (Intelligence + Investigation) introduce fact roll to declare the location and time of the Calibration Gate’s next appearance in Creation (p. 99).
The amount of time before the gate appears depends on her roll; its location is chosen by the Storyteller but should be reachable from the Sidereal’s current location within the allotted timeframe.
SUCCESSES GATE APPEARS 1 Within a few days 2-3 By the end of the day 4-5 Within a few hours 6-7 Within a few minutes 8+ Instantly, at the Sidereal’s current location Once the Calibration Gate appears, it remains open for at least a scene, but the Storyteller is encouraged to be generous if the player characters need more time to accomplish a goal using it.
