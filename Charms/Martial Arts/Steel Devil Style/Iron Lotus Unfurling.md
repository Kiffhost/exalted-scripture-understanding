*After performing [[Twin-Blade Defense]]’s Cross-Blade Catch, the Steel Devil may pay five motes, one [[Willpower]] to twist her blades apart with supersonic force, disarming her opponent and hurling his weapon two range bands hence.*
This Charm is modeled as a disarm gambit (p. 199) with double 9s on the [[Initiative]] roll. If it succeeds, the Exalt may pay three motes to unleash a point blank [[Sonic Slash]], adding two automatic successes to the attack roll and ([[Essence]]) damage dice to the attack’s base damage. The Exalt must know the [[Sonic Slash]] Charm to use this attack.
