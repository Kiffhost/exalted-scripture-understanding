*Whispering to her arrow, the Exalt infuses it with a more specific desire to implant in her adversary’s heart.*
This Evocation is a passion-inciting gambit that creates an automatically successful persuade action instead of an inspire action. It must still leverage an appropriate [[Intimacy]] to succeed, even though it is unrolled. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used against an enemy in [[Initiative]] Crash. 

## Resonant

This influence costs an additional point of [[Willpower]] to resist in a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]].
