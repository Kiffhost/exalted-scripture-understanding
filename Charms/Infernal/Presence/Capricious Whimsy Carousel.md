*The Infernal’s erratic passions can be swayed, but not always in the direction that one might expect.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after her Resolve is beaten by emotion-based influence, defending against it by inverting the emotion in question. A roll to inspire fear fills her with courage; a roll to instill a Tie of desire creates one of revulsion. This doesn’t necessarily render her immune to harmful effects: a Psyche effect that inflicts an incapacitating despair might instead leave her unable to do anything but laugh. However, it does reduce the cost to resist any harmful effects by one Willpower. This defense doesn’t apply to any other characters targeted by the influence.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Ecstatic Passion Kaleidoscope]] reflexively with this Charm, inspiring herself with the emotion that the influence was inverted into.
## Reset
Once per session.
