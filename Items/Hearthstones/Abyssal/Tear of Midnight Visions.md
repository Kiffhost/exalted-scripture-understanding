**Example Manse**: A sky-piercing tower of obsidian, veiled in an aurora of somber indigo radiance.
This mesmerizing indigo violane fills the night with haunted omens. Those who sleep within four miles of it must succeed on a difficulty 2 ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) roll each night to recover [[Willpower]] from sleeping. The bearer may draw from one of her [[Intimacy|Principles]] related to death or the dead to shape the emotional tenor of these unsettling dreams; characters may accept this [[Intimacy]] at Minor intensity to recover [[Willpower]] even if they fail the roll. They can’t voluntarily erode the [[Intimacy|Principle]] until they leave this hearthstone’s range.
