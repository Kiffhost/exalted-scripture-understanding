The Dragon-Blood smells the sin on a criminal’s back, pursuing him through city and wilderness alike by the scent of his iniquity. She makes a case scene roll with double 9s to investigate a piece of evidence. The base difficulty of this roll is 3, although the Storyteller may increase the difficulty based on the length of time since the object was left, any exposure to the elements, or supernatural concealment. On a success, the Dragon-Blood is able to pick up the scent of the character who left the evidence. If she’s already familiar with that individual, she identifies him immediately. The Dragon-Blood doubles 9s on rolls to track that character by smell, and can recognize his scent without needing an Awareness roll upon coming within medium range of him. In addition, the Storyteller may inform her player, through the Exalt’s keen sense of smell, whenever a case scene or profile character roll would turn up information relevant to that character.
