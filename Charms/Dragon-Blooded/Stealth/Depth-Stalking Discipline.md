*The Dragon-Blood submerges herself in Water Essence to wash away anything that might betray her presence.*
She doubles 9s on [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] rolls. While surrounded by water, such as being submerged or in driving rain, she doubles 8s and is completely imperceptible by scent — able to evade the hunting hounds of a god by fleeing into a storm, or to swim through the sea while bleeding heavily without drawing the notice of siaka. 
This Charm can only be used once per scene.
