*The Infernal’s words spread like an invisible ripple through the cosmos, entreating a monster of the deep to rise and serve her will.*

Touching a body of water, the Infernal summons an aquatic animal to her. She’s not limited to local wildlife, beckoning summoned creatures through a secret current between seas. She’s limited to animals that would be one- or two-dot familiars (Exalted, p. 216), but can draw them through mutagenic tides, granting five dots of mutations. It takes (10 – Essence) minutes to reach the Infernal.

The summoned creature has a Defining Tie of obedience to the Infernal that can’t be weakened or altered. It’s capable of understanding her as if it had a human-level faculty for complex and abstract thought. If the Infernal meditates while submerged in liquid, she can communicate with it no matter the distance between them.

The Infernal can have up to (Essence) summoned creatures at a time. Once she reaches this limit, subsequent uses release one of her creatures from this Charm’s other effects.
## Reset
Once per day.
## [[Keys]]
#### Terror of the Depths (Essence 2) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge summon animals that would be three-dot familiars. She can also use this key to summon aquatic First Circle demons while it’s night — or any time, if she calls them from the Demon Sea.
#### Frenzied Shoal Summoning (Essence 3, [[#Terror of the Depths (Essence 2) (+1wp)|Terror of the Depths]])
The Infernal can pay a seven-mote surcharge to summon a Size 3 battle group of aquatic animals that would be one- or two-dot familiars, or a Size 2 battle group of animals that would be three-dot familiars or First Circle demons. They take (6 – Essence) rounds to appear, or one round for extremely fast animals. Battle groups have average Drill, or elite Drill for pack hunters. Demons have Might 2. This key is incompatible with [[#Benthic Horror Beckoning (Sail 5, Essence 5, Terror of the Depths (Essence 2) (+1wp) Terror of the Depths ) (+4m, 2wp)|Benthic Horror Beckoning]].
#### Benthic Horror Beckoning (Sail 5, Essence 5, [[#Terror of the Depths (Essence 2) (+1wp)|Terror of the Depths]]) (+4m, 2wp)
Once per story, the Infernal can pay a four-mote, two-Willpower surcharge to summon an aquatic behemoth. It takes (24 – {Essence x 2}) hours to arrive. The imposed Tie is only Major, and the Infernal must make influence rules as usual to convince it to perform life-changing tasks (Exalted, p. 216). She can’t make it take actions that would violate a Defining Intimacy. Using this key reduces this Charm’s duration to (Essence) weeks. The Infernal can only have one summoned behemoth at a time.
