Savoring the taste of divine ichor, the Lunar subsumes its nature into her own. After incapacitating a spirit or fae with Demon-Drinking Fang, she can pay one Willpower to absorb its Essence instead of destroying it. She gains the following benefits for one story, or until she next uses this Charm: 
-  A Major Intimacy reflecting her victim’s nature and purpose. 
-  Up to (Lunar’s Essence + victim’s Essence) dots of mutations reflecting its capabilities. 
-  Its Cult Merit, if higher than hers. Once the story ends, the Lunar may either permanently destroy her victim, or spit it forth from her Essence, sparing it.
