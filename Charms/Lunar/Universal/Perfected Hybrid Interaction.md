The Lunar mingles many shapes freely. Upon purchasing this Charm, her player chooses four dots of mutations reflecting animal forms she possesses. Using this Charm lets her gain any or all of them for one mote per dot of mutation. Mutations added to animal forms donâ€™t count when determining what Protean effects apply. This Charm may be purchased (Essence) times, with each repurchase granting four additional dots of mutations. The Lunar can replace previously selected mutations with new ones when repurchasing it.
