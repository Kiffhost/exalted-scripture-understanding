*Death’s Lawgiver has little patience for fools and sinners, swift to upbraid their unrighteous ways.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she witnesses someone act in a way that violates one of her Defining Intimacies or death’s chivalry. She forms a Minor Tie of contempt for him. As long as she openly expresses her scorn, she increases that Tie’s [[Resolve]] bonus by one and adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on influence rolls that solely target the offender or seek to turn others against him.
The Abyssal retains the Tie after this Charm ends.
With [[Integrity]] 5, the Abyssal can use this Charm when one of her Major Intimacies is violated.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal can invoke [[Whispers]] to use this Charm without provocation, tapping the limitless hatred of the Neverborn.
