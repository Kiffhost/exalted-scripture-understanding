*The Abyssal has a sixth sense for danger, eerily prescient in matters of life and death.*
When the Abyssal makes an [[Awareness]] roll to detect a hidden enemy or other danger, she gains one mote for each 9 she rolls and two motes for each 10. This can’t exceed the number of motes spent enhancing the roll.
Additionally, the Abyssal can make [[Awareness]] rolls while asleep, unconscious, or incapacitated, suffering no penalties for doing so. She may awaken instantly upon successfully detecting a threat, or even revive herself from unconsciousness if incapacitated, though she still suffers the effects of incapacitation.
