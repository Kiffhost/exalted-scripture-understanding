*Those who beat their fists against the Infernal break only their own hands.*

The Infernal clashes an attack against her with an undodgeable (Stamina + Resistance) disarm gambit. Against unarmed attacks and natural weapons, she clashes with a decisive attack rather than a disarm gambit. She can clash ranged attacks, but attackers aren’t disarmed and the Infernal doesn’t pay Initiative for the gambit.

If the Infernal wins the clash, her attack gains a Tie of terrified awe toward her unless he pays one Willpower.
