*The Infernal dreams of strange, ever-shifting forms and alien designs, glimpsing the impossible wonders known only else to Oramus, who sees beyond the world.*

After at least five minutes spent in fever-dream sleep or drug-induced hallucinations, the Infernal may exchange craft points of one type for another. She may exchange silver points for gold points or gold points for white points at a rate of two to one, or white points to gold points or gold points to silver points at a rate of one to two. Each activation only allows her to convert one type of craft points.

This feverish inspiration urges the Infernal to create strange new wonders. For the rest of the day, she adds (Essence) dice on rolls to make something she’s never created before or to create something unique, like most artifacts. However, she suffers a one-success penalty Craft rolls to create something she’s made before, or something made from a preexisting design.
