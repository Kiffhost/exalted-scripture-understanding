The Dragon-Blood’s outline wavers and distorts like heat haze, her movements seeming to double and treble as she trails afterimages. She gains +2 Evasion. This Charm ends if a nontrivial enemy attacks her and rolls no 1s, even if she successfully defends. In Fire Aura, withering attacks don’t end this Charm even if they have no 1s, as long as they have no 10s.
