*The Abyssal tempers raw recruits in a crucible of brutality, refining them into living — and unliving — weapons.*
The Abyssal spends a week training a battle group to grant its members the traits of battle-ready troops (Exalted, p. 496), where better than their own, and increase its Drill to average. Alternatively, she can spend a month training a battle group with average Drill to grants its members elite troop traits (Exalted, p. 497) and raise its Drill to elite.
With Essence 3, the Abyssal can spend a month training a battle group with elite Drill to grant one of the following benefits. Any experience points spent on these benefits are refunded if the enhanced battle group is slain.
### Legion of Life’s End
For three experience points, the Abyssal grants a battle group +1 Might when facing opposition from mortals or battle groups made up of the living. If it has Might 0, the bonus increases to +2.
### Soul-Numbing Prowess
For three experience points, the Abyssal grants the battle group perfect morale (Exalted, p. 210), breaking their fear by confronting them with death’s inevitability.
### Warlord of Death’s Dominion
For three experience points, the Abyssal grants a battle group +1 Might while in shadowlands and the Underworld. If it has Might 0, the bonus increases to +2.
