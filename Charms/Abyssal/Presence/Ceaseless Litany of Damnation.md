*The deathknight’s grim persistence grinds down even the strongest of wills.*
The Abyssal resets a failed instill, persuade, or threaten roll. If she succeeds on the renewed roll, she gains one Willpower. A character targeted by her renewed influence can’t bolster his Resolve with an Intimacy he used against the original roll, nor can he cite that Intimacy in a Decision Point.
## Reset
Once per scene.
