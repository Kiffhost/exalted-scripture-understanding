*The Abyssal’s audacious leadership unnerves enemy commanders, making them second guess time-tested strategies.*
When the Abyssal makes a Strategic Maneuver roll, opposing penalties suffer a −1 penalty, daunted by her terrifying tactics. This subtracts a success instead if an opposing general has a Tie of fear to the Abyssal or already suffers a penalty on his roll from unfamiliarity with her or her forces (Exalted, p.
211).
