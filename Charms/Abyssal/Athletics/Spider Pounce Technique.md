*The Abyssal moves in impossible bounds, landing in a hunched crouch only to leap away again.*
The Abyssal uses a reflexive move action to jump one range band vertically or horizontally without needing to roll.
If the deathknight uses this Charm on multiple consecutive turns, the cost of activations past the first is reduced by one mote.
