With the return of the Solar Exalted comes the return of old magic. The power of the Sun’s Essence flows in Creation once more. With this Charm, the Solar establishes a field of (Essence * 2) yards in radius, in which the Essence of the world is quickened with Solar power, where old things come alive again, and truly wondrous things may happen. Anyone standing in this field gains a nonCharm dice bonus to their Craft, Lore, Occult, and Medicine rolls equal to the Solar’s Essence. In addition, repair and Medicine rolls are made at one less difficulty. The Solar must be attempting to repair an object or treat an injury to use this Charm, and its effect lasts until her work is finished. Characters who stand within the circle of the Solar’s influence see her work with greater clarity and understanding.
