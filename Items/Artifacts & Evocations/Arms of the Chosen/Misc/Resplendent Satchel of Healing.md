While these medical artifacts were first manufactured for the Anathema, most in use today trace back to the Shogunate. Each is an orichalcum-inlaid green jade case one foot long, one foot wide, and three inches deep, engraved either with the mark of the [[Twilight]] Caste or Sextes Jylis’ sigil. All share the same contents — moonsilver and orichalcum acupuncture needles, starmetal diagnostic tools, jade surgical instruments, bandages of wood spider silk, vials of First Age panaceas, and other wondrous paraphernalia. While using the satchel’s contents, the Exalt adds a non-Charm bonus success on [[Medicine]] rolls that use these tools, reduces the mote cost of all non-Excellency [[Medicine]] [[Charms]] by one (to a minimum of one), never suffers penalties from inadequate equipment, and can staunch and sterilize wounds without a roll. Attuning the satchel costs one mote. 

At the end of each story, the Exalt must roll ([[Wits]] + [[Medicine]]) at difficulty 3 to renew any supplies the satchel is running short of and to purge it of insalubrious [[Essence]]. On a failed roll, she must restock the satchel with a successful roll using any appropriate Ability ([[Survival]] to gather rare herbs, [[Bureaucracy]] to trade for necessary supplies, [[Larceny]] to steal them from a rival physician, etc.) before she can use the satchel again.
