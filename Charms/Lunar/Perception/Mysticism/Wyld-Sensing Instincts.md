The Lunar’s senses are attuned to the Wyld’s flux and flow. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) on a roll to detect or track fae, read their intentions, uncover evidence of their doings, diagnose maladies caused by fae or the Wyld, or perceive the nature of Wyld phenomena. 
## Protean 

In animal forms with sense-enhancing Merits, the Lunar waives this Charm’s cost when using it to enhance rolls with an enhanced sense.
