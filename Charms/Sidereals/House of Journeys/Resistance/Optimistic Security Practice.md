*Reflecting on the sacrifices she may one day be called upon to make, the Sidereal imbues her enemies with her own generosity of spirit.*
After a withering attack hits her, but before damage is rolled, the Sidereal imposes a –2 penalty on the damage roll. If she has a positive Tie or compassionate Principle applicable to her attacker, the penalty increases to (Intimacy + 1).
If the Sidereal is unarmored, she can penalize decisive attacks.
