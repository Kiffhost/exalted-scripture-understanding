Bringing the cycle to its completion within her soul, the Dragon-Blood embodies its totality. To use this Evocation, the Dragon-Blood must progress through three Elemental Auras in the order of the cycle within one scene (wielders who’ve awakened Inverse Cycle Attainment may instead use it by progressing through three Auras in reverse order). Leaving Aura doesn’t interrupt her progress, but if she enters an Aura that’s not next in the cycle, she must begin anew. She gains the following benefits:
 - While she’s in an Elemental Aura, she also counts as being in the Aura of the next element in the cycle. Wielders who’ve awakened Inverted Cycle Attainment may instead extend this to the previous element in the cycle when they enter Aura (but not both).
 - Bonfire anima doesn’t prevent her from entering any element’s Aura. Each time she enters an Aura, she may automatically flare to bonfire.
 - When she expends her Aura as part of a Charm’s cost, she adds a free full Excellency.
 - She adds (Essence) dice of post-soak damage to withering attacks with Elemental Bolt Attack and elemental spells, and (Essence) dice of damage to decisive attacks with the same.
 - She can waive All-Under Heaven Unity’s Willpower surcharge once per round.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens for free when the Dragon-Blood progresses through three Auras in order (or reverse order, with Inverse Cycle Attainment) while fighting against at least one nontrivial enemy, and can be used immediately.
