Tulat once knew many secret arts of obfuscation; now, he has but one. When a character makes a Perception-based roll against Tulat’s wearer, she may reflexively move one range band toward him and, if he’s within range, clash his roll with a decisive attack, rolling Join Battle if necessary. If it’s an opposed roll, like an Awareness roll against her Stealth, she must declare this Charm when she takes the action, using the same roll for both the action and the clash. Unrolled effects opposing the wearer’s Guile can also be clashed, forcing the opposing character to roll (Perception + Ability). 

## Dissonant

This counts as the wearer’s attack for the round.
