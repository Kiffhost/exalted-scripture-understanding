*The Abyssal’s senses hone in on her foe’s [[Essence]], granting accuracy to match her malice.*
The Abyssal reflexively aims before making a decisive attack, and converts the dice added by aiming to non-Charm successes.
With an [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, this Charm can be used on withering attacks against crashed enemies. It hits and rolls damage even if the attack roll fails. She can only do so once for each crash period.
