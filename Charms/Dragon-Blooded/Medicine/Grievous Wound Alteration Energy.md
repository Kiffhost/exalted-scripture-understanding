*Even the most horrific injuries inflicted by the Anathema yield to the Dragon-Blooded physician’s life-saving prowess.*
This Charm upgrades WoundClosing Technique, allowing the Dragon-Blood to pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to treat aggravated damage with it. She rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]), each success converting a level of aggravated damage to lethal. Any successes above her patient’s total aggravated damage convert levels of lethal damage to bashing.
