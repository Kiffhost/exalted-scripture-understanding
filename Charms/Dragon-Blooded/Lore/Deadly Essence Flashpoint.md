The Dragon-Blood inverts the destructive force of her anima banner, drawing it inward and letting it build unto a terrifying strength. Whenever she would roll anima flux, she may instead commit one mote to hold her flux in abeyance. She may have up to (higher of Essence or 3) activations of this Charm stacked.
When the Dragon-Blood makes a decisive attack, she may release all motes committed to this Charm to add one die of decisive damage per mote as her unleashed flux wreathes the attack. If she enhances an Elemental Bolt Attack this way, its range is extended by one range band, maximum long.
This Charm’s Aspect is the same as the Dragon-Blood’s.
