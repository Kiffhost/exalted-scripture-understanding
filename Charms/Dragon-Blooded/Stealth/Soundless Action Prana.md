The Dragon-Blood silences herself with an inner whirlwind, drawing in the sound of every unintended gasp or misplaced footstep before it reaches the ears of her foes. Every 10 on a [[Stealth]] roll rerolls a non-1 failed die, and she can’t be detected by hearing unless the opposing character’s hearing is superhuman or magically enhanced. Such characters still take a −2 penalty on rolls to hear her.
