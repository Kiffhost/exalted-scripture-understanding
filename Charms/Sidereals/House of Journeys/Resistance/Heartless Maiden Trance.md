*The Sidereal’s chest convulses as she swallows her heart, purging her body of mortal weakness.*
The Sidereal ignores wound penalties and doesn’t need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. Any poisons or diseases she suffers from are held in abeyance; she doesn’t suffer their effects and their duration is suspended. She’s immune to crippling effects and other hostile magic that targets the heart, like [[Heart-Ripping Claw]] (Exalted, p. 456). She ceases to regain [[Essence]] naturally, although she still regains motes in combat.
