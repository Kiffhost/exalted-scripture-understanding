The Lunar’s predatory instincts fixate on someone unfortunate enough to catch her interest, watching his every movement from the shadows. Her player designates a Storyteller character (either present or nearby). She devotes herself to pursuing and observing him from a distance with as much stealth and subtlety as possible and making him fear whatever pursues him. She can’t directly interact with him, except to menacingly reveal her presence at suitably dramatic moments, but she can leave hints or signs of her hunt.
If her prey evades her, she must continue pursuit. If the Storyteller deems it infeasible for her to catch him again, or simply uninteresting, he may have her player designate a new character as her prey.
This ends if the stalked character confronts the Lunar and defeats her in combat or causes a significant setback or complication for her.
