*The Lunar’s muscles surge with ferocious [[Essence]], giving them the strength of steel hawsers.*
She adds a grapple’s attack roll extra successes as dice on the [[Initiative]] roll. Against lower-[[Initiative]] enemies (determined before paying the gambit’s cost), she also adds these dice to the control roll. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Legendary Size or grapple-related abilities, the Lunar adds ([[Essence]] + [[Strength]]) to her Initiative to determine if she receives the control roll bonus.
