*The Lunar roars to clear the skies.*
She draws in a mighty breath, immediately ending any ongoing precipitation within medium ranges by inhaling the clouds from which it falls. This can end supernatural weather such as [[Rain of Doom]] (Exalted, p. 483), although the Storyteller may deem that this exposes the Lunar to an interval of such weather’s harmful effects, or devise a unique poison or one-time environmental hazard to represent them. Weather created by ongoing magic, such as the daiklave [[Stormcaller]], won’t recur within the cleared area that scene. The Lunar may reflexively use [[Behemoth’s Terrifying Inhalation]] alongside this Charm, waiving its [[Initiative]] cost, to also inhale poisonous or similarly hazardous vapors within range. This Charm can only be used once per day.
