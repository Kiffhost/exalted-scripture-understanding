*The Lunar embodies the archetypal Other, set apart from society yet defining it through her presence.*
When she makes an influence roll against one or more members of a specific culture, she treats each as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Principle]] reflecting a specific custom of that culture. She must be aware of the custom she invokes, either appealing to it overtly or subtly phrasing her argument to prey on it. If the Lunar has a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the culture in question, she may pay an additional [[Willpower]] to instead treat the custom as a Major [[Intimacy|Principle]]. Outcasts, dissidents, and any culture members whose personal [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] conflict with the custom still only treat it as Minor.
