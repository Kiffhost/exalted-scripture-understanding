The Sidereal hauls even the weightiest of burdens with strength well-suited to backbreaking labor. The Sidereal lowers the cost to drag a grappled enemy to one round of control, and steals a point of [[Initiative]] from him. Alternatively, the Sidereal can roll a ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) feat of strength to drag, pull, or carry something, gaining [[Strength]] of the Mastâ€™s benefits for free.
