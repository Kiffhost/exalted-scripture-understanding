*The Infernal’s mind surges with inspiration greater than the mortal soul can bear, envisioning the very workings of the cosmos.*

The Infernal rolls (Intelligence + Craft) after a scene spent poring over designs, explaining her creations to a captive hero, examining models and prototypes, boasting over her latest creation, working in her laboratory, or the like. She gains silver points equal to her successes and a gold point for each 10. An audience isn’t necessary, but who doesn’t want an audience?

The Infernal doubles 9s if her labours involve exotic substances and reagents of the Demon City, demonic specimens, the forbidden lore of Hell, or the like, or a hellish stunt suitable to the Storyteller. However, if she receives any gold points, she gains a related Minor Intimacy: fascination with the transformative properties of vitriol; annoyance with one of her demonic minions; an arrogant confidence in her ability to master forbidden powers. She can’t voluntarily weaken it for the rest of the session.
## Reset
Once per story.
### Keys
#### Blasphemous Epiphany of Design
The Infernal always doubles 9s, and doubles 8s with hellish crafting. With Craft 5, Essence 3, she always doubles 8s, and doubles 7s for hellish endeavours.
#### Triumphant Genius Vindication (Essence 2, [[#Blasphemous Epiphany of Design]])
The Infernal can reset this Charm by completing a superior project.
### Ceaseless Brilliance Appreciation ([[#Triumphant Genius Vindication (Essence 2, Blasphemous Epiphany of Design |Triumphant Genius Vindication]])
The Infernal can use this Charm once per day. However, she can’t gain more than one gold point and (Essence + 2) silver points for each Craft Ability that she has rated at 5 dots. She can wait until after the roll to decide whether to invoke the once-per-story waiver of this limitation.
### Raving Enlightenment Lesson ([[#Triumphant Genius Vindication (Essence 2, Blasphemous Epiphany of Design |Triumphant Genius Vindication]])
The Infernal gains an additional (Essence + 5) gold points when she uses this Charm. This isn’t compatible with Ceaseless Brilliance Appreciation’s daily use.
#### Cosmic Forge Comprehension (Essence 3, [[#Raving Enlightenment Lesson ( Triumphant Genius Vindication (Essence 2, Blasphemous Epiphany of Design Triumphant Genius Vindication |Raving Enlightenment Lesson]])
Once per story, when the Infernal uses Raving Enlightenment Lesson, she also gains five white points.
