*Stories and songs of the Sidereal’s bloody deeds may be forgotten, but not the fear they inspire in her foes.*
When the Sidereal makes a threaten roll based on violence, her fearsome history radiates from her. When determining if her threat is sufficient to motivate her targets, they’re treated as if they knew everything about the Sidereal that’s relevant to the threat and her ability to make good on it. They don’t actually learn anything about her. Instead, they feel only a frisson of nameless dread toward her (or an inexplicable sense of safety, if the Sidereal can’t or won’t back up her threat).
If this Charm causes a character’s Resolve to be penalized by a Major or Defining Intimacy, or if he already had a Major or Defining Tie of fear to the Sidereal, he must pay an additional Willpower to resist.
### Example
Anys Syn, disguised as a village washerwoman, threatens to thrash a meddlesome river spirit with a tree branch unless he leaves the village alone. Ordinarily, a threat of violence from a mere mortal would hold little weight for him, but he’d much rather let the village be than face a Sidereal grandmaster’s wrath. Overcome with inexplicable terror, the river spirit flees the washerwoman and keeps well away from the village in the future.
