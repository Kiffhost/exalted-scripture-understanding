*The Lawgiver settles down for a minimum of one minute, writing a description of a person with certain character !!traitstheExaltrequires.Inasingleminuteshecandescribe!! a character’s specific appearance (“a man with an islander’s cast”), skill set (“good at being discrete, fully literate in Seatongue and skilled in Azurite legal writ”), social Ties (or lack thereof), and a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]].*
Then the Solar waits. If a mortal who matches the description of the character is within a day’s travel, they will arrive at the !!placewheretheSolarwrotethedescriptionwithintheday.!! If the Solar is in an unreachable or foreboding place the character will only go as far as they are comfortable before returning to their regular course. Characters drawn by this Charm are not aware of any overt magic that has drawn them to the place of writing. It is up to the Exalt to identify the character, and then to do with them as she wishes. This Charm provides no guarantee that the subject will cooperate, or that they will appreciate being set on by the Solar. It gives her no control over them whatsoever, only a chance to compel them to her purposes. It may also come to pass that no character in range perfectly matches the Solar’s bequest. In that case, the nearest match to the description will be drawn instead.
