When taking a read intentions action to discover what a target wants from her, the Solar may reflexively activate this Charm, applying a -2 penalty to the targetâ€™s Guile. In order to use this Charm, the Solar needs to have already succeeded at a read intentions action against the target in the scene, reading his intentions while he was interacting with someone other than the Solar.
