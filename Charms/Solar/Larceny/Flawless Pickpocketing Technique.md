With hands quicker than the eye, the Exalt relieves a hapless soul of his material burden. This Charm enhances a normal pickpocketing attempt (see p. 224). Unless contested by magic, this attempt cannot fail; when such a conflict arises, this Charm adds the Solar’s Essence in automatic successes. To use this Charm, the Exalt must be close enough to touch her target. In every other way, this Charm follows the rules of a normal pickpocketing attempt. The character may not steal items that are in use or artifacts that have been attuned. Characters using ordinary senses cannot detect this theft with Awareness. Characters with inhuman sensory acuity, such as a spider feeling vibrations in its web, or those using magic, like a Celestial Lion’s Intemperate Gaze, suffer a -4 dice penalty to spot the theft. Flawless Pickpocketing Technique is also completely immune to magic that detects Larceny-based actions, unless the user also knows Flawless Pickpocketing Technique.
