Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit The Lawgiver can ride her mount into the teeth of the storm. If the Solar uses Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit, she may commit two additional motes to extend the power of that Charm to her mount.

If the Solar knows ElementResisting Prana, extend the effect of that Charm to her mount as well, using the Solar’s Resistance.
