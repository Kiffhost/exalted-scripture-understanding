*Radiant with lightless flame, the Abyssal unleashes an inferno of damnation.*
When the Abyssal makes a decisive attack with [[Crypt Bolt Attack]], she may pay a three-mote surcharge to unleash a wave of necrotic energy, applying her attack against all characters — friend or foe — within close range of the primary target. She divides her ([[Initiative]] + [[Essence]]) evenly, rounded up, among each struck character to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring [[Hardness]].
Alternatively, the Abyssal can center the blast on herself. This doesn’t harm her, only those within close range.
