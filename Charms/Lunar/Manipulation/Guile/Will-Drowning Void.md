*Those who gaze too long upon the embodied enigma that is the Lunar find themselves lost in the perilous depths of the unknown.*
If a character fails a roll opposing the Lunarâ€™s [[Guile]], he loses one [[Willpower]], which she gains. This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] through deception, cunning, or trickery.
