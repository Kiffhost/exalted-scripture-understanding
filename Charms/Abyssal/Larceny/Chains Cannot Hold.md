*The Abyssal’s soul is a chained and tortured thing, breeding contempt for any lesser restraint.*
The Abyssal can use [[Insidious Shade Infiltration]] to escape restraints, like being tied up or manacled to a wall. While grappled, she can use it reflexively to roll ([[Wits]] + [[Larceny]]) at a difficulty of her enemy’s current rounds of control. Success frees her from the grapple. If she fails, she can’t use it again for the rest of that grapple.
