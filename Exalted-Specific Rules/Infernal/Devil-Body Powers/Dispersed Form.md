The Infernal’s body is distributed out over an area. She could be a numinous being of prismatic lightning, an amorphous monstrosity of acidic sludge, or a swarm of mirror-shards reflecting her true visage. She gains the following advantages:
- She gains the [[Area Attack]] power for free.
- She halves the minimum damage of withering attacks against her, rounded down, and subtracts one level of damage from decisive attacks against her. These benefits don’t apply against weapons with the Flame or Siege tags, attacks enhanced by magic capable of striking multiple enemies or an area of effect, or other effects the Storyteller deems capable of harming her body. She’s immune to grapples, unless enhanced with magic that could let them constrain her dispersed body, and she cannot be knocked prone.
- Human-sized or smaller characters suffer a −3 penalty on rolls opposing her rushes or disengages, and rolls to disengage from her.
