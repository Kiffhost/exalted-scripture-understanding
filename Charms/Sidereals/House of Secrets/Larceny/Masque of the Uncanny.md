Twisting the strands of her fate, the Sidereal inverts her semblance into that of her nemeses. The Sidereal rolls to instantly disguise herself as an enemy of fate, without needing equipment. She ignores penalties for disguising herself as characters of a different race, sex, or body type or impersonating specific characters. She can manifest supernatural sensory displays and mimic the Caste Marks and anima banners of Exalted enemies of fate. Characters without superhuman or magically enhanced senses can’t roll opposing the Sidereal’s disguise unless she acts out of character; even then, they suffer +1 target number. Success doesn’t reveal the Sidereal’s identity, only that she’s not what she seems. With a Larceny 5, Essence 3 repurchase, divination, magical scrying, magic based on someone’s identity, and similar effects can’t provide information that contradicts this disguise, giving false results where necessary. Magic that enhances mundane efforts to contest disguises is unimpeded.
