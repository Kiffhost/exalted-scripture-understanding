*Defying the Abyssal is an ordeal of the flesh as much as the will, leaving those who will not submit to her reeling and bloodied.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after beating a character’s [[Resolve]] with a bargain, threaten, or persuade roll, increasing the cost to resist by one [[Willpower]] and one level of lethal damage. This damage is always obvious to onlookers: the victim might bleed from his ears, manifest gruesome stigmata, cough up blood, or the like. If the Abyssal’s influence has multiple targets, she must use this Charm separately against each of them.
