*The deathknight’s elusive grasp claims wrests away her foe’s treasures, looting barrow-relics from their soon-tobe tomb.*
The Abyssal gains the following benefits when she uses Rapacious Wraith’s Grasp
- She can pay a three-mote surcharge to use it reflexively on her turn without it counting for the attack for the round. She can only do so once per turn.
- She doubles 9s on the Initiative roll.
- If she succeeds on a disarm gambit against an enemy within close range, she can reflexively ready the weapon if she has a free hand. If it’s an artifact, she automatically breaks its former wielder’s attunement and can choose to attune it herself.
