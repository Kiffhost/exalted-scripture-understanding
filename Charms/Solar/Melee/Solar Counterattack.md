*The Exalt draws focus from her foe’s temerity.*
To strike her is to invite death. The Exalt may use this Charm in response to any attack she attempts to parry, creating a [[Melee]] counterattack that occurs after the opponent’s attack result, but before damage has been rolled. This attack functions as a regular decisive attack. [[Solar Counterattack]] does not count as the Exalt’s combat action and cannot be used in response to another counterattack.
