*Dredging up hidden sins and buried secrets, the Abyssal blackmailer controls her victims with chains of shame and fear.*
When the Abyssal succeeds on a roll with Hidden Eye Surveillance, Midnight Vigil Inquisition, or Witness of Unspoken Shame, she can pay one Willpower to bank her extra successes. She can add up to (higher of Essence or 3) banked successes as a non-Charm bonus when she takes the following actions against the victim of her surveillance
- Influence rolls that leverage an Intimacy revealed by the roll that triggered this Charm.
- Threaten rolls to blackmail him with information gathered through surveillance.
- Read intentions, profile character, or Awareness rolls to uncover additional information related to what her surveillance has uncovered.
- Lore rolls relevant to what her surveillance has uncovered.
- Raising her Resolve or Guile against him, gaining +1 per success.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm against, any previously banked successes are lost.
