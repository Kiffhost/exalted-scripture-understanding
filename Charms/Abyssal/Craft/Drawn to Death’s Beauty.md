*Who can look away from death? The Abyssal’s works draw in those who gaze on them like moths to folly’s candle.*
The Abyssal can pay a four-mote surcharge when she uses Magnificent Cenotaph Allure to imbue her art with death’s mesmerizing allure. Characters affected by its influence are compelled to approach and claim her work, which counts as a Defining Intimacy. They suffer a −3 penalty on Perception and Awareness rolls to notice anything else. In combat, they must use their movement action each turn to approach it.
Affected characters will face risks equivalent to a serious task (Exalted, p. 216) under this compulsion but won’t take actions that would obviously physically harm them. If no safe path exists, they’ll stop and observe from where they are.
This costs three Willpower to resist, separate from Magnificent Cenotaph Allure’s influence.
This effect fades immediately when Magnificent Cenotaph Allure ends. The Abyssal can only have a single enhanced use of that Charm at a time.
