*Moving with a speed beyond that of time itself, the stylist this style’s ultimate killing art, a technique that Jehu Khoor forbade his disciples to use.*
The stylist makes a decisive attack against any number of enemies she can perceive within medium range, blurring between them all in a split-second, ending her movement anywhere within medium range of her starting point. This has a base damage of (Initiative/2) against each enemy. Trivial characters are hit automatically and slain instantly. Against enemies whose onslaught penalty equals or exceeds their [[Essence]], this attack is unblockable and undodgeable for them. If it exceeds their [[Essence]] by three or more, the attack becomes an ambush for them. 
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by gaining 20+ [[Initiative]] in a single tick.
