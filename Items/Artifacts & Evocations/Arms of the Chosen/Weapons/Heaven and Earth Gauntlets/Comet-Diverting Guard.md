The [[Heaven and Earth Gauntlets]] answer violence with violence, ringing like bells with the force of deflected blades or arrows. The wielder may reflexively clash an attack against her with a withering attack. Winning the clash stops the enemy’s attack from hitting her, but she doesn’t roll damage against him, although she still gains 1 [[Initiative]] for hitting and inflicts a point of onslaught penalty as normal. This doesn’t count as her combat action for the round. 

## Resonant

The wielder may roll withering damage against an enemy on a successful clash. However, the wielder gains no [[Initiative]] from this damage.
