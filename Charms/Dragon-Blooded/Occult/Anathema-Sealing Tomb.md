When the Dragon-Blood incapacitates a spirit with a decisive attack, she may use this Charm to seal its [[Essence]] away into the nearest dramatic manifestation of Earth [[Essence]]: the depths of a cavern, a cairn or standing stone, a statue, an Earth demesne or manse, a mountain, or something similar. The imprisoned spirit is unable to reform itself (Exalted, pp. 508-509) for at least ([[Essence]]) centuries, and spirits that cannot reform themselves (including most elementals and First Circle Demons) are sealed away permanently. The spirit can be freed by destroying its earthen prison, a dramatic endeavor as difficult as the Storyteller deems appropriate. It’s unknown what would happen if this Charm were used to seal one of the Deathlords or Yozis; the result is explicitly left up to the Storyteller’s discretion. Sorcery
