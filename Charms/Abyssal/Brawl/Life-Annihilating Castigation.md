*Soul-destroying pyreflame swirls like an inferno around the Abyssal, revealing the awful depths of her wrath.*
The Abyssal makes a withering attack, multiplying her post-soak damage by her (opponent’s base wound penalty + 1) and rerolling 1s on the damage roll.
If the deathknight crashes her opponent, pyreflame erupts from within him, inflicting (Abyssal’s Strength) dice of aggravated decisive damage, ignoring Hardness and rerolling 1s until they cease to appear. Each 10 on the withering damage roll adds another die of decisive damage — and if the Abyssal used Entropic Scourge Annihilation, so do 9s. An opponent killed with this attack is burned away to nothing, leaving no ghost or even ashes.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by incapacitating an especially powerful enemy, like an Exalt.
