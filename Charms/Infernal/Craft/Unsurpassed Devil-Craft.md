*The Infernal’s works marry mad genius with frenzied labour, unsurpassed by lesser smiths.*

The Infernal rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on a Craft roll. If she rerolls at least three 6s, she also adds a non-Charm successes. She always gains this bonus on Craft rolls that involve the exotic substances of Hell or the craftsmanship of its demonic denizens.
## [[Keys]]
#### Brazen Panoply Forging (Essence 2) (+1wp, +4gxp/wxp)
The Infernal can pay a surcharge of one Willpower and four gold to points use this Charm after a Craft roll. If it’s a roll for a legendary project, she must spend white points instead. The bonus for rolling three 6s increases to two non-Charm successes and (Essence) non-Charm dice. As usual, the Infernal always receives this bonus on rolls involving hellish crafting.
#### Demon-King Atelier (Craft 4, [[#Brazen Panoply Forging (Essence 2) (+1wp, +4gxp/wxp)|Brazen Panoply Forging]])
The Infernal adds an additional non-Charm success for each 6 that’s rerolled into a success. If it’s rerolled into a 10, she adds two non-Charm successes. If she uses this Charm together with Demon Prince Handiwork, she also adds two successes for a die rerolled into a number that she’s doubled with that Charm.
#### All-Shaping Vitriol Crucible (Craft 4, Essence 2)
The Infernal always receives the bonus for rerolling three 6s. She waives this Charm’s cost on rolls involving hellish crafting, except for superior and legendary projects.
#### Infernal Glories Wrought (Craft 5, Essence 3, [[#Demon-King Atelier (Craft 4, Brazen Panoply Forging (Essence 2) (+1wp, +4gxp/wxp) Brazen Panoply Forging )|Demon-King Atelier]])
For every three successes the Infernal rolls, she rolls an additional non-Charm die. Successes from these dice are counted in determining how many total dice she can roll with this Charm — e.g., if she rolled three successes with the extra dice, she’d then roll another die.
#### Primordial Demiurge Perfection (Craft 5, Essence 4, [[#Infernal Glories Wrought (Craft 5, Essence 3, Demon-King Atelier (Craft 4, Brazen Panoply Forging (Essence 2) (+1wp, +4gxp/wxp) Brazen Panoply Forging ) Demon-King Atelier )|Infernal Glories Wrought]])
When the Infernal rolls enough successes to trigger Infernal Glories Wrought, she rolls three additional non-Charm dice. She only receives this benefit once per roll, no matter how many successes she receives.
