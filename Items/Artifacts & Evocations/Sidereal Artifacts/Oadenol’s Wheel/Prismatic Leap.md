Oadenol’s Wheel soars through the air on a glittering trail of the lumenir’s varicolored stardust to swoop down on foes. This Evocation can only be used while the Wheel is a chariot. Its driver leaps one range band horizontally or up to two range bands vertically toward an enemy. If this reaches close range with an enemy, one of the lumenir may reflexively make a withering or decisive attack. This counts as an impale attack on a vertical leap, adding +5 dice of withering damage or +3 dice of decisive damage. Alternatively, the Wheel’s master can use Star-Spoke Transition for free to attack with it, gaining the same benefit. 

## Resonant

The attack is impaling on horizontal leaps as well. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used once per scene.
