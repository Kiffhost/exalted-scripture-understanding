To find secrets, one must keep secrets. The Dragon-Blood may use Naked Thief Style (p. 203) while Calumny is collapsed to conceal it as a small mundane object, such as an ornamental fan, necklace, or pipe. No roll is necessary to conceal it; its true nature is completely undetectable by anything short of Eye of the Unconquered Sun or comparable effects.
