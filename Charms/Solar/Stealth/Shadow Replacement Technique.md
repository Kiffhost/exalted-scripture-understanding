*Gripping her foe like a vice, the Lawgiver’s penetrating gaze opens a rift into her target’s soul, allowing her to hide there.*
This technique requires the Lawgiver be in control of a grapple, after which she must then successfully execute a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]]) roll which surpasses her target’s [[Resolve]], with a number of automatic successes equal to the Exalt’s [[Essence]] and a number of bonus dice equal to half the remaining rounds of clinch control, rounded down. If successful, the Solar appears to step into her target’s shadow and bleed away. The Solar takes possession of her target’s senses and motor functions, and can make her victim act against a negative [[Intimacy]] or act against something to which he has a positive Minor [[Intimacy]] without contest. If the Solar attempts to make her host act against a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]], use the social influence system as normal, though the subject can terminate this Charm by successfully resisting such influence. Abstract [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] such as “I refuse to be controlled” or “I cannot be forced to take action" are not valid for the purpose of this Charm— when resolving the effects of [[Shadow Replacement Technique]], treat such [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] as nonexistent. (See also the “[[Intimacy|Intimacies]] and Roleplaying” sidebar, p. 172.) Unlike other forms of control, a Solar can use [[Shadow Replacement Technique]] to force a victim to harm or even kill himself; however, the Solar is subject to damage equal to any suffered by her subject while in possession. While this Charm is active, Vanishing from Mind’s Eye Method can be targeted to the host alone, and costs only five motes to activate. [[Shadow Replacement Technique]] still works on targets that do not have a shadow. Replacing someone’s shadow counts as being concealed within full cover for the purposes of [[Shadow-Crossing Leap Technique]].
