*Outmaneuvering her foe with supreme agility and wily cunning, the Lunar forces him into disadvantageous footing.*
After successfully dodging a decisive attack, she can use this Charm, causing her attacker to lose [[Initiative]] (which she doesn’t gain) equal to the 1s on the attack roll, maximum (Lunar’s [[Essence]]). 
## Protean 

In shapes with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]], the attacker’s 2s also cause him to lose [[Initiative]].
