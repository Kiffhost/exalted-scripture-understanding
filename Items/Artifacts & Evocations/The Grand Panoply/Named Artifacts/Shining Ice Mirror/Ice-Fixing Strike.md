The Solar swings Shining Ice Mirror in an Essence-laden arc, intensifying the killing cold it has already spread onto the battlefield into a mantle of ice. The Solar makes a withering attack against an opponent suffering penalties from Winter Night Cut or Cold Moon Slash, and if it inflicts damage, theyâ€™re immediately covered in a mantle of encumbering frost which makes movement actions and flurries impossible, and which inflicts a further -1 penalty to all actions and to Defense. This icy mantle breaks apart once the target no longer suffers any penalties from Winter Night Cut or Cold Moon Slash.
