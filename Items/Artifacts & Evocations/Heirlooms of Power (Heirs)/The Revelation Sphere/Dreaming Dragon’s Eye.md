Manipulating the Revelation Sphere’s puzzle-mechanisms as she meditates, the Dragon-Blood’s consciousness sinks into deeper contemplation. She reduces the cost of Fivefold Resonance Sense (Dragon-Blooded, p. 231) by two motes, and applies its bonus on Awareness, Investigation, Occult, or Survival rolls to detect any artifact or place or power. On rolls to detect jade artifacts, elemental demesnes or manses, or places of power otherwise linked to elemental Essence, any successes she adds with A Dream of Ancient Ice are non-Charm.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens for free when a Dragon-Blooded Amilar scion attunes to the Revelation Sphere.
