The Sidereal refuses untimely conclusions to her journeys, from manacles to a demon's petrifying gaze. The Sidereal makes a feat of demolition with a free full Excellency against something that restrains her, blocks her movement, or otherwise impedes her physical freedom. She ignores any penalties from such restraints or limitation â€” even if her entire body is bound in chains, she could shatter them with breath control alone. For a one-Willpower surcharge, the Sidereal can use this feat to shatter an ongoing magical effect that impedes her physical freedom. Such feats' minimum Strength and difficulty equal the (Essence + 2) of the character responsible for the effect.
