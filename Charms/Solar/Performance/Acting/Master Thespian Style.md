*The greatest actors have the talent of making their audience forget.*
The Solar spends five minutes getting into character, psyching herself up, tuning her voice, repeating lines or otherwise practicing dance moves or musical movements. As long as she stays in character, this Charm raises the Exaltâ€™s [[Guile]] by one for the rest of the scene. Characters who fail to read her intentions while this Charm is active will pick up on false [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] or motivations that align with the role the Lawgiver is playing, and be convinced they are real. If the Exalt enters a scene with a dramatic stunt befitting the role she wishes to play, she may activate this Charm reflexively. This Charm is expressly permitted to be combined with Flawlessly Impenetrable [[Disguise]] (p. 317).
