The Exalt may touch a willing target who has an active mote pool, and may use this Charm to switch a number of his motes from peripheral to personal motes and vice versa. Roll a free full (Intelligence + Lore) Excellency with (Essence) automatic non-Charm successes to determine how many motes are converted. The Solar may not use this Charm on herself until Essence 5+, but if Lore is her Supernal Ability, waive this requirement.
