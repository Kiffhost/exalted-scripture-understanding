The Sidereal believes that some piece of significant information must be kept secret from everyone she knows and the world at large for their own good. She refuses to reveal it or anything that might help someone discover it on their own, except in hints so cryptic as to be useless. She’ll confiscate or destroy any documents or records containing such information and ensure those who already know it won’t reveal it, whether by persuasion, coercion, or mind-warping magic. If she must, she’ll kill to keep the secret,though she can spare those for whom she has positive Ties.
This ends if the Sidereal’s secrecy creates a significant obstacle to her or her Circle’s goals.
