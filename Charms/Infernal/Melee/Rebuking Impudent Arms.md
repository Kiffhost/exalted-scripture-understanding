*Those who dare take up arms against the Green Sun Prince soon learn the greatness of their folly.*

The Infernal makes a disarm gambit, adding (higher of Essence or 3) dice on the attack roll. If she succeeds, her enemy’s weapon is engulfed in emerald flame as it’s flung aside, causing their wielder to take (Infernal’s Essence) dice of damage. This ignores Hardness. Wooden weapons are destroyed. Metal weapons remain superheated for the rest of the scene. If a character picks it up, they suffer (Essence) additional dice of damage.

An enemy who defends with their Parry suffers the above consequences even if they successfully block the attack, suffering (Essence) dice of damage unless they drop the weapon. Wooden weapons are destroyed while metal weapons are superheated as above.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can used [[Kissed by Hellish Noon]] (p. XX) reflexively with this Charm to extend the gambit’s range.
