The Sidereal dredges forth memories lost to Lethe, stirring dead hearts with passions they once held. The Sidereal makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [[Medicine]]) instill roll against an undead, imposing an [[Intimacy]] that it possessed in life on it for the scene if she succeeds. Mindless undead are susceptible to this Charm and can be affected by influence rolls that align with the revived [[Intimacy]]. The Sidereal can revive a specific [[Intimacy]] if she’s aware of it and of one of the target’s experiences or memories related to it; otherwise, the Storyteller chooses the [[Intimacy]]. Undead with [[Essence]] greater than the Sidereal’s can spend one [[Willpower]] to resist, becoming immune to further uses that scene. Abyssals don’t regain Intimacies; instead, their mind and [[Essence]] reject these memories in a moment of soul-rending agony, gaining one [[Limit]]. Similarly, Liminals are disoriented and overwhelmed by the memories dredged from their flesh, gaining an [[Intimacy]] chosen by the Storyteller and suffering a −3 penalty on all actions they take that scene. This costs one [[Willpower]] to resist, rendering the victim immune for the scene.
