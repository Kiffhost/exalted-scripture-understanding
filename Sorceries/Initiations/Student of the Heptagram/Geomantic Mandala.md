The sorcerer channels Essence through elemental geomancy, gaining one additional sorcerous mote each turn she spends shaping a spell in an elementally aspected demesne or manse.
Once per story, she may tap an elementally aspected hearthstone to which sheâ€™s attuned to gain five sorcerous motes (ten from a greater hearthstone) until the end of the scene. Doing so renders that hearthstone defunct until the story ends.
