*Huskflayer’s master enfolding herself in scraps of unliving flesh, drawing sustenance from her grisly harvest.*
Huskflayer’s wielder rolls dice equal to her gore points, gaining temporary −0 health levels equal to her successes as she grafts unliving flesh onto herself. Temporary health levels are the first to be filled with damage, and vanish when filled.
Non-dissonant characters can repurchase this Evocation, letting them spend up to one gore point per success to heal that many levels of non-aggravated damage, in addition to gaining temporary levels. This can only be used once per day.
## Resonant
The wielder doubles 9s on the roll.
## Dissonant
The wielder can’t gain more than ([[Essence]]) temporary health levels.
## Special activation rules
Huskflayer’s wielder can use this Evocation reflexively when she reaps 7+ gore points or when she uses Tatterdemalion Husk Abomination (p. XX).
## Reset 
Once per scene.
