Meditating in communion with the Essence of underground waters, the Dragon-Blood can find hidden springs in the most desolate climes, beckoning them forth with a mighty stomp that sends a font of water gushing up from underground. She rolls (Wits + Survival) against a difficulty based on her environs — finding a spring in a region that receives regular rainfall or has abundant natural aquifers might be difficulty 1-2, while doing so in an arid desert is difficulty 5+. A successful roll creates a spring. Normally, this spring becomes a permanent feature of the environs, but in regions so harsh that a spring couldn’t conceivably exist, it flows for only a limited time, providing enough water to sustain the Dragon-Blood, plus one additional character for each threshold success, for a day. She can only draw water up from the ground; she couldn’t use this Charm to pierce a marble floor or the hull of a boat. In the scene that this Charm is used, the waters that flow from the spring are suffused with purifying Essence. Any character who drinks of the water and either has a positive Tie towards the Dragon-Blood or accepts one out of gratitude may add a non-Charm bonus success on all Athletics, Resistance, and Survival rolls he makes for the rest of the day. Roaring Dragon Font can only be used once per story, unless reset by succeeding on a difficulty 4+ Survival roll.
