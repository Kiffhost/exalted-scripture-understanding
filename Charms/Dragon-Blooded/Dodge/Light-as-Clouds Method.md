*The Dragon-Blood takes advantage of her enemy’s lust for battle, turning the wasted momentum of his attack into a burst of wind that carries her out of danger.*
When she uses [[Hopping Firecracker Evasion]], she may pay a four-mote surcharge to reflexively roll to disengage, adding bonus dice equal to the Overwhelming rating of her enemy’s weapon. If successful, in addition to [[Hopping Firecracker Evasion]]’s usual effects, she can reflexively move away if any enemy moves toward her before her next turn, as per a standard disengage. This doesn’t count as her move action for the round. Such uses of [[Hopping Firecracker Evasion]] are both Air- and Fire-aspected.
In Air or Fire Aura, the [[Initiative]] cost to disengage is waived.
