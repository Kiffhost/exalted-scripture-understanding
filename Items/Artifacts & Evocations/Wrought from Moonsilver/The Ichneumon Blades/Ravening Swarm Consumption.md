The moonsilver splinters seeded in a victim’s flesh move slowly and agonizingly towards his heart, bringing a gruesome death closer with each passing minute. The wielder rolls (Manipulation + Brawl) opposing the (Stamina+Resistance)rollofacharacterwithatleastone splinter within medium range. If successful, all splinters in his body begin moving toward his vitals. Model this as a supernatural disease, with morbidity (splinters + 3) and a one-day interval. In addition to the usual effects of disease (Exalted, p. 234), it has the following effects: Minor: The victim’s wound penalty increases by one point. Add +1 to the difficulty of surgery to remove splinters unless enhanced by magic. Major: As above, and whenever the disease inflicts a botch or Willpower loss, it also rolls a die of lethal damage against the victim, ignoring Hardness. The surgery’s difficulty is increased even for efforts enhanced by magic. Defining: As above, and after each scene in which the victim is physically active, he suffers a die of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. Surgery to remove the splinters is impossible without magic, and rolls two dice of lethal damage in addition to inflicting an automatic level. If a victim’s splinters have been transformed by Argent Brood Eruption, their movement through his flesh is much more dangerous — each day, he suffers (splinters) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. This disease can kill characters with Exalted Healing. The wielder is aware of deaths caused by it, and can use Wasp-of-the-Labyrinth Trick for free to reanimate the corpse. She may provide the zombie a simple directive to carry out or leave it to mindlessly attack any living being it encounters. This Evocation can only be used against a given character once per story. 

## Special activation rules

After successfully using Whispering Wound Infestation on a character, the wielder may use this Evocation against him reflexively and regardless of distance. 

## Resonant

Successfully infecting an enemy with this Evocation resets the wielder’s attack (Exalted, p. 255). 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with the Ichneumon Blades can’t awaken this Evocation.
