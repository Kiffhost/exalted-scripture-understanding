*The stylist leaps into a spinning kick with both legs, coming at an enemy from behind to strike his face.*
To use this Charm, she must have thrown or slammed a grappled enemy on her last turn (or reflexively before her current turn, with applicable magic). She makes an unarmed decisive attack against that foe, which receives the same damage bonus from forgone rounds of control as the throw or slam that set up this attack.
If the stylist stunts with a description of how she uses her surroundings to ensure her foe’s in a vulnerable position or gain leverage for her kick, her attack becomes a surprise attack (Exalted, p. 203). She strikes from her foe’s blind spot, a mysterious blur of violence. This stylist can use [[Raptor’s Fatal Descent]] reflexively to enhance this attack, ignoring its usual restrictions as she delivers a powerful kick that leaves her at ground level. 
## Terrestrial
The damage bonus added to the stylist’s attack can’t exceed (Initiative/2, rounded up).
