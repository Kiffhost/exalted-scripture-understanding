*The Lunar steals the safety of home, and with it, identity.*
She performs a [[Sacred Hunt]] to claim an animal or human shape by infiltrating a place her target considers home: a peasant’s hovel, a Dynast’s estate, a wolf’s den, etc. To do so, she must be in the home at the same time as her target, escape without being captured, and do something that reveals the extent of her intrusion — stealing a precious heirloom, carving her name into a wall, leaving a letter scented with her favorite perfume, etc. — such that her victim forms a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her, or whoever he believes she is. If the Lunar is captured or retreats to avoid capture, the [[Sacred Hunt]] fails, and she can’t take her target’s shape through this Charm for the rest of the story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means.
