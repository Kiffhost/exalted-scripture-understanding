The Lunar tastes her prey’s mind in his heart’s blood. Upon claiming a shape, she gains one of his Ties to an individual at Minor intensity. She must know of the Tie beforehand, either through reading her target’s intentions or by correctly inferring his Intimacies. While in the target’s shape, she gains all of his memories related to that Tie. The Storyteller should reveal specific memories when they become relevant, and the Lunar may introduce facts using these memories as though they were a relevant Lore background. This Charm ends if the adopted Tie is completely eroded. The Lunar may stack this Charm to retain the memories of multiple victims, and/or a victim’s memories of multiple Ties. An Intelligence 5, Essence 3 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a four-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to gain all of her target’s memories, not just those related to the adopted Tie. She can also gain an animal’s memories without needing to adopt a Tie. She can’t eidetically recall every moment of her prey’s life, remembering only to the extent that he did, though she can improve this with magic like Counting the Elephant’s Wrinkles (p. XX). Note that this only conveys memories of events, not skills, although she may consult stolen memories as a mentor for mundane traits (Exalted, p. 178).
