*Moving with the grace and speed of a zephyr, the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s steed effortlessly evades harm.* 
This Charm supplements a mounted disengage roll, rerolling 6s until they fail to appear and negating all penalties from flurrying the roll.
In Air Aura, this Charm also refunds the [[Initiative]] cost of a successful disengage.
