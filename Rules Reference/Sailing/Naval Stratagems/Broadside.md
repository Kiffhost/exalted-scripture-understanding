The character’s ship draws alongside its opponent and savages it with anti-ship weaponry, such as catapults or ballistae. This inflicts one level of [[Hull]] damage, or two levels of [[Hull]] damage if deploying antiship combat [[sorcery]] or First Age weapons such as [[Lightning Ballista|lightning ballistae]] or [[Implosion Bow|implosion bows]]. A ship must have antiship weaponry or a crewmember capable of making such magical attacks to take this stratagem. Acquiring and installing non-magical ship weaponry such as catapults is usually a [[Resources]] ••• expense.
