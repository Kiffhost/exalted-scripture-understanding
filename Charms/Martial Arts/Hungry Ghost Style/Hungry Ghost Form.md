*The martial artist howls with bestial fury, muscles twisting and eyes shining with baleful light as she embodies the hungry ghost she will one day become.*
The stylist gains the following benefits
- Her lower soul swells with monstrous power. Intimacies based on primal emotions count as one step higher. Defining Intimacies instead add +1 to their Resolve bonus and to their effective value in calculations for Hungry Ghost Charms like Shrouded Claw Attack.
- She gains the Hideous Merit. If she already has it, she adds (Essence) non-Charm dice on threaten rolls.
- She doubles up to (Essence) 10s on decisive damage rolls. If she flurried the attack with a rush, this can double 9s as well.
- She adds (higher of Essence or 3) soak.
## Special activation rules
Upon dealing enough decisive damage to a nontrivial enemy to increase his wound penalty, the stylist may reflexively enter this Form.
