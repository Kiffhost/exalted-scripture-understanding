The Sidereal shrouds misdeeds in mystery, throwing censors and investigators off the track with tantalizing red herrings. The Sidereal adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on a conceal evidence roll. Characters that fail opposing rolls believe they succeeded, uncovering a false clue shrouded under the auspices of one of the House of Secret’s constellations: The Guardians: The evidence points to a crime committed in an attempt to cover up something else. The Key: The evidence points to something seemingly paradoxical or contradictory that must have some rational explanation — the stuff of locked-room mysteries, mistaken identities, and contrived thought experiments. The Mask: The evidence points to a conspiracy, criminal syndicate, or other secretive assemblage. The Sorcerer: The evidence points to the power of supernatural beings, artifacts, places of power, or the like. The Treasure Trove: The evidence points to a premeditated crime that was planned out methodically, the work of a criminal genius. With an Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to make investigators think the false evidence is genuine even on a successful, in addition to the true evidence. The investigator is aware of the discrepancy, but not of which piece of evidence is true. This effect can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through deception or concealment. Oracles can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
