Steeped in fell power from before the world, Soulfarer is willing to share its knowledge with a sorcerer who sates its hunger. While Soul-Drinking Hunger is active, the wielder banks one sorcerous mote that can be spent on any spells she casts for every two levels of decisive damage her attacks inflict. Sorcerous motes banked with this Evocation are lost at the end of the scene if not spent. In addition, taking a Shape Sorcery action counts as a successful decisive attack for maintaining Soul-Drinking Hunger’s duration. 

## Resonant

Awakening this Evocation allows the Exalt to draw one spell of the Terrestrial Circle from within Soulfarer at no experience point cost, allowing her to cast that spell as long as she wields the weapon. If she pays that spell’s experience point cost, she may choose a new Terrestrial Circle spell to unlock with this Evocation.
