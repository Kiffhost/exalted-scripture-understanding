*The Abyssal’s spellbinding words cage the hearts of those who read them, curdling even the bitterest of hatred into envy.*
The Abyssal makes a written inspire, instill, or persuade roll that also counts as a roll to instill a Tie of admiration, respect, or fascination toward the Abyssal. Alternatively, for writing that doesn’t convey other social influence, she makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Linguistics) instill roll. Characters with negative Ties toward her are instilled with a Tie of envy instead. If a target already has such a Tie, the level of Intimacy needed to support his influence is reduced by one (Exalted, p. 215). This Intimacy can’t be voluntarily eroded unless a target resists this influence by spending (Intimacy + 1) Willpower.
Affected characters are enthralled by the Abyssal’s peerless writing style. They increase the Tie’s Resolve penalty by −1 against the Abyssal’s influence with any Ability but can use it to bolster their Resolve against any other influence. As long as they have the Intimacy, they cannot regain Willpower from sleeping unless they spend at least an hour each day reading and re-reading the Abyssal’s writing.
