Dropped into the crouched, predatory pose of a tiger preparing to pounce, the martial artistâ€™s Essence comes to embody the pinnacle of predatory grace. Her fingers seem like claws as they move through their strikes, and her eyes narrow to cat-like slits. While Tiger Form is active, the martial artist may double up to (Strength) extra successes when calculating the raw damage of withering attacks, and takes no penalties for fighting while prone. She also adds (Essence) dice to rush actions and all rolls to contest a disengage. She gains any Initiative spent by an enemy attempting to disengage from within range of him. 

## Special activation rules

Whenever the martial artist lands a decisive attack that deals 3+ levels of damage, she may reflexively activate Tiger Form. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood may double up to the lowest of Strength, Dexterity, and Wits extra successes when calculating the raw damage of withering attacks.
