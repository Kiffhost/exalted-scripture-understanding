A delver into forbidden secrets and explorer of otherworldly vistas, the Lunarâ€™s will is greater than any force that assails it. She adds (Essence) non-Charm Resolve against influence that would cause her to gain a Derangement, or against any Psyche effect. Alternatively, she adds (Essence) non-Charm successes on a roll with any Attribute to avoid gaining a Derangement. If successful, she gains one Willpower.
