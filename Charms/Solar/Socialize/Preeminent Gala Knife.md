The Lawgiver is a master of social theatre, drawing strength from her success like prayer from the cup of the gods. Each time she succeeds at a read intentions action, defends her Guile, or succeeds at a Socialize action with a difficulty of 0 or higher, she gains two motes of Essence. The Solar may not gain more motes of Essence than she has used activating Socialize Charms in the scene.
