*Seizing upon the slightest moment of hesitation, the Abyssal strikes down unwary foes.*
If the Abyssal wins [[Join Battle]] and makes a decisive attack on her first turn, she adds dice equal to the difference between her [[Initiative]] and her target’s [[Initiative]] on the attack roll.
With [[Thrown]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the enhanced attack doesn’t reset the deathknight’s [[Initiative]].
