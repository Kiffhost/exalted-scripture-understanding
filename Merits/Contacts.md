This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
Each purchase grants the character a network of contacts willing to feed him information. The player must specify what sort of contacts he’s purchasing at the time the Merit is gained. Examples might include contacts within the Immaculate [[Order]], the Delzahn nomads, the court of the Tri-Khan of Chiaroscuro, the [[Guild]], the craftsmen of Nexus, House Mnemon, Western ship captains, the Lintha family, a specific noble family of Port Calin, all noble families of Port Calin, or the smugglers of the Haslanti League.
One-dot contacts are generally confined to a single citystate or similar region. Three-dot contacts may span a broad area or indicate an organization with vast but specific reach and influence, while five-dot [[Contacts]] mean that almost anywhere the character goes within a Direction, he’ll be able to find applicable contacts within the purchased field.

#### Sidereal
Three-dot [[Contacts]] covers a single bureau, while five-dot [[Contacts]] span the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]].
