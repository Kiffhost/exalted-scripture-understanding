Time slows to a standstill as the wielder drives Gnomon down into the ground. She has a heartbeat’s worth of frozen time in which to move between moments. To use this Evocation, the wielder must win Join Battle at the beginning of combat and use it on her first turn. Time halts around her, allowing her to take a single action with any Ability during the frozen time — either a combat action, a miscellaneous action, or any other action she could normally take on her turn. She cannot use it to activate Simple-type Charms. Once time resumes, she takes her actions for the turn normally. Step Between Seconds doesn’t count as her combat action or movement action for the round if she attacks or moves while time is stopped. Outside of combat, the wielder may use this Evocation once per scene to take a single action in frozen time. If the wielder attacks an enemy in frozen time, the normal flow resumes a split-second before she completes the attack. Her foe, perceiving the attack as an almost imperceptible blur, suffers the −2 Defense penalty for a surprise attack. Likewise, if she makes an opposed roll — such as pickpocketing a character or entering concealment — characters opposing it suffer a −3 penalty. Some actions, like social influence, cannot be used to affect other characters while time is stopped, at the Storyteller’s discretion. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used outside of combat once per day. 

## Resonant

An Essence 4 repurchase of this Evocation allows the wielder to make a decisive attack during frozen time without resetting to base Initiative on a hit.
