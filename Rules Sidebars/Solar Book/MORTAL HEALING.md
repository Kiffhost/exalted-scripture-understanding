The bodies of the Exalted are far more resilient than mortal flesh. Mortals cannot heal lethal damage to their -2 and -4 health levels at all unless resting, and will bleed to death at a rate of one point of lethal damage per minute if they suffer any single injury which inflicts lethal damage equal to or greater than their [[Stamina]] rating (stanching such bleeding is an [[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]] roll with a difficulty equal to the mortalâ€™s wound penalty, minimum 1 and maximum 5; the difficulty increases by 1 if the mortal is treating himself). Additionally, mortals heal at a slower rate than the Chosen, as detailed below: 
- Recovering a -0 health level takes 12 hours if bashing, or two days if lethal. 
- Recovering a -1 health level takes one day if bashing, or four days if lethal. 
- Recovering a -2 health level takes four days if bashing, or one week if lethal. 
- Recovering a -4 health level takes one week if bashing, or one month if lethal. 
- Recovery from Incapacitation is up to the Storyteller, as with the Exalted. Recovering from lethal Incapacitation almost always leaves some sort of permanent debility, though skilled medical treatment may minimize this.
