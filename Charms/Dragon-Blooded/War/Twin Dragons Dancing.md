Drawing power from the bonds of Sworn Kinship, the Dragon-Blood and her oath-sibling attain an incomparable battle-unity. When she uses Tiger-and-Dragon Combination to unleash a signature move with a Hearthmate, each of them may expend their Elemental Auras to transcend their limits, adding a free full Excellency on both attack rolls. If the two Auras were of different elements, both Dragon-Blooded count as being in those elements’ Auras for purposes of determining what Charms they can activate to enhance the attacks (although they can’t use other Charms that require them to expend Auras), and they can use Charms of both elements together on the attack as though they were Balanced. If the two Auras are the same, then both Dragon-Blooded receive 5 motes each that can be spent on Charms of that element to enhance the attack.
A Dragon-Blood can only participate in a combination attack enhanced by this Charm once per story, regardless of whether he activated it or not, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal as a result of protecting a Hearthmate from physical danger, or by working together with a Hearthmate to defeat a foe more powerful than either of them alone.
