Gunzosha armor propels its wearer’s every movement, allowing her to keep pace with the fastest of rival despite her armor’s weight. She adds an automatic success and ignores the armor’s mobility penalty on a rush, disengage, contested roll in a race, or a roll to accomplish a challenging climb, jump, or the like.
