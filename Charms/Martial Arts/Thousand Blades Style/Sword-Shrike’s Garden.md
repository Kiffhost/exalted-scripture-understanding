The stylist’s panoply whirls rapidly around her in a deadly ring of god-metal, cutting down foes who dare approach her.
The stylist’s whirling weapons extend out to close range. They’re an environmental hazard with difficulty (Arsenal), Damage (Arsenal)/round. (The hazard deals the same type of damage as the weapon.) With Arsenal 3+, they also count as difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199).
They don’t affect the stylist or her allies — her blades gracefully swerve to avoid them.
While using this Charm, the stylist waives Wings-ofSteel Bulwark’s Initiative cost.
This Charm ends if the stylist is crashed.

## Mastery
With Arsenal 5+, the stylist’s whirling blades extend out to short range.
