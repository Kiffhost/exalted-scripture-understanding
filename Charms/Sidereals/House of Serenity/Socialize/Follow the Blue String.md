The Sidereal sees the strands of fate that connect two people, sensing the emotional tenor of their relationship. When the Sidereal succeeds on a read intentions roll that reveals a Tie to another individual, if her successes beat the Guile of that Tieâ€™s object, she learns what Intimacy, if any, he has for the character she read. He need not be present for her to do so.
