*Everything unfolds as the Lunar has foreseen.*
To use this Charm, she must be fighting under a stratagem she’s successfully enacted. Allied battle groups add a success on attack rolls, and she rerolls 1s on [[Intelligence]]-based command actions. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm.
