WINDBLADES All windblades allow the attuned wielder to fly while standing atop them for five motes per hour of flight.
They travel at a speed of thirty-five miles per hour, but can’t ascend more than medium range above the ground. Aerial movement on a windblade uses the same dice pools as ordinary movement, but the windblade adds its Speed Bonus to the roll as nonCharm dice. The Speed Bonus is halved, rounded down, if the windblade is weighed down by anything more than the wielder and her personal possessions, such as a second person being carried by her or unusually heavy cargo.
A windblade’s wielder can take a miscellaneous action to collapse it, rendering it nonfunctional but reducing it to the size of a heavy belt buckle. She can return it to full size with another miscellaneous action. A windblade’s Evocations can’t be used while collapsed unless they specify otherwise.
Blazerider’s attunement cost and Speed Bonus are typical of most windblades. All windblades are First Age artifice and have a minimum Artifact rating of four dots.
The same speed that bears Blazerider’s master through the sky also makes the windblade a deadly weapon against her foes. The wielder can use it as a heavy artifact Thrown weapon (Damage +14, Overwhelming 5) with the Cutting, Lethal, Special, and Thrown (Medium) tags. It returns to the wielder upon being thrown.
If the wielder attacks with Blazerider while flying on it, she falls one range band downwards before it returns to her, positioning itself perfectly to catch her.
