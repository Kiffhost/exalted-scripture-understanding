The Solar is the guardian of her thoughts. If she’s in a situation where [[Mastery of Small Manners]] would apply, she may use this Charm to supplement a persuade or instill action that speaks to group policy, changing cultural attitudes or steering future courses. This Charm ensures that her arguments are logical and extremely well thought out: reroll all 1s until 1s fail to appear, and deny the benefits of the Solar’s 1s to the magic of her enemies.
