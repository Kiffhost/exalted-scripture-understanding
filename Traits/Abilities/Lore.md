**This Ability is necessary to create artifacts.** 

Lore represents a character’s understanding of the world, covering academic disciplines of history, mathematics, geography, literature, science, philosophy, and similar scholarly pursuits. It can be used both to recall useful pieces of academic knowledge, as well as to perform scholarly research in a library or archive. It is also important in the forging of artifacts and the raising of manses. Players must note the subject of their character’s education when selecting Lore, as this impacts the scope of what the Ability may cover for them (see p. 237 for more details on using Lore)— Lore 5 alone makes the character a world-class savant, but doesn’t mean she knows everything. Lore areas of expertise can be expanded with specialties and roleplaying.
