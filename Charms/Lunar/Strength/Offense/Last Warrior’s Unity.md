*The Lunar’s hands flow over and around her weapon, melting and merging until warrior and weapon are one.*
She fuses a weapon to her body, making it impossible to disarm, but rendering the hand or hands holding it unable to take other actions. This Charm can be stacked to merge with multiple weapons, waiving the [[Willpower]] cost of subsequent activations. If the Lunar shifts into an animal shape unable to normally wield the weapon, it’s banished Elsewhere as usual (p. XX) unless it’s moonsilver. Moonsilver weapons assume compatible forms, and can merge with extremities normally unable to wield weapons — a [[grand daiklave]] might become a massive stinger extending from a scorpion’s tail; a [[dragon sigh wand]] might fuse with an eagle’s beak. These don’t count as natural weapons; she uses her own dice pools instead of the animal’s to attack with them. In shapes with the Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] [[Merits]], such weapons’ base withering damage is capped at ([[Strength]]) against larger foes.
