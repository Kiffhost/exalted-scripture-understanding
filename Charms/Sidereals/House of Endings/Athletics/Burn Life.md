The Sidereal shortens her allotted lifespan by a few days to suffuse her body with strength stolen her future. The Sidereal gains up to (Essence) bonus dots of Strength, paying three motes per dot. This can raise her above Strength 5. If she’s unarmored, she adds +(Strength) soak, which includes these bonus dots. Using this Charm slightly but permanently reduces the Sidereal’s lifespan; this doesn’t need to be tracked but can provide roleplaying opportunities. If the Sidereal has five dots in a Martial Art, she can use its Form Charm reflexively when she uses Burn Life.
