*All courage dies in the presence of Death’s Chosen.*
The Abyssal can only use this Charm while HeartStopping Mien is active, and doing so ends that Charm.
She adds (Essence) dice on threaten rolls with a single target and can use fear-based influence against characters who are normally immune to it. In combat, enemies lose one Initiative at the end of each round in which they didn’t attack her.
This Charm’s mote cost can’t be muted.
With Essence 5, if the Abyssal reaches bonfire anima while this Charm is active, she may use Heart-Stopping Mien for free. Enemies who’ve previously resisted it lose their immunity, though they regain it if they resist a second time.
