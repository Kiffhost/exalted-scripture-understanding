*Running her fingers through the weave of fate and crossing her wrists, the Sidereal switches strands of fate between herself and an enemy.*
The Sidereal rolls a ([[Wits]] + [[Larceny]]) gambit against the [[Resolve]] of an enemy within short range. The [[Initiative]] roll’s difficulty is 3. Success lets the Sidereal either impose a −3 penalty on all of her victim’s mental, physical, or social actions or lower his soak by three. The Sidereal profits from her theft, adding three dice on all rolls of the penalized category or gaining three soak. This lasts until the scene ends. A single character can only suffer a single use of this Charm at a time, but the Sidereal can stack the benefits from multiple uses, but can’t stack the same bonus (e.g. dice on physical actions) multiple times.
