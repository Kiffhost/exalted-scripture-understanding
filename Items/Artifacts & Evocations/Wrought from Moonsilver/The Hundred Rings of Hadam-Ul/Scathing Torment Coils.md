*The Hundred Rings wind around their captured prey, extending razor-thin spines that press menacingly against him.*
When a grappled foe makes an attack against any character, the wielder may unleash a decisive counterattack against him. She adds her current rounds of control, maximum ([[Strength]]), as dice of damage. 

## Resonant

With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the wielder may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to clash the attack instead.
