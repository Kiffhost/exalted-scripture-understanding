*Lurking in night’s darkness, the Lunar stalks her prey.*
After profiling a character or reading his intentions without him being aware of her, if she Joins Battle against him within ([[Essence]] + [[Perception]]) days, she adds non-Charm dice equal to the 1s and 2s on that character’s [[Join Battle]] roll. If she acts before the stalked character in the first round and attacks him, she adds that many dice on the damage roll.
