Making the Greater Sign of the [[Shield]] against her foes in blood red stardust, the Sidereal, shatters their courage. The Sidereal wordlessly makes a ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) threaten roll against all enemies who can see her, ignoring multiple target penalties. Affected characters suffer the following: 
-  They must flee, either putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the Sidereal or finding a safe place to hide. 
-  They add +1 die on rolls to flee or hide from her, but suffer a −3 penalty on all other rolls. 
-  They must disengage to move away from her as long as they’re within medium range of her. Battle groups are especially vulnerable to this, suffering −2 [[Resolve]] against it, or −3 if they have poor [[Drill]]. If affected, they suffer +1 target number on rout checks. 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal can use this Charm reflexively when she incapacitates a powerful foe or routs a battle group.
