After successfully dodging an attack, the Exalt may activate this Charm to remember a single Charm used in the attack. She feels its spiritual form and pressure as a physical thing and understands how to dodge it. For the remainder of the scene, she perfectly evades the effects of that Charm. [[Hundred Shadow Ways]] cannot be used against the Excellency Charm of any Ability, nor can it be used against [[sorcery]] or [[Evocations]]. Furthermore, if the Exalt falls into [[Initiative]] Crash, this Charm ends.
