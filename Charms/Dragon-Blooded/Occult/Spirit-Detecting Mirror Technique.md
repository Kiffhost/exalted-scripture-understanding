Drawing back the veil between worlds, the Dragon-Blood makes invisible spirits and phantasms visible within the glass. To use this Charm, she must be touching a mirror or a similar reflective surface, such as the blade of a well-polished daiklave. The Exalt can see the reflections of dematerialized characters in that mirror, and can even hear what they say in the form of whispers that rise up from the mirror’s surface. Only the Exalt is capable of seeing the reflection — to others, even the spirit itself, it doesn’t appear in the mirror. This doesn’t allow the Dragon-Blood to physically interact with spirits, but it can be used in conjunction with magic that does. Using reflections to pinpoint a foe is somewhat awkward — instead of fully negating the −3 penalty for attacking a dematerialized spirit one can’t see, it reduces the penalty to −1. An [[Occult]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase of this Charm lets the Dragon-Blood pay one [[Willpower]] to make the spirit reflections visible and audible to her allies as well. Their attacks against it still take a −1 penalty.
