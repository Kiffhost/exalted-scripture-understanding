The Dragon-Blood descends into the earth beneath her, either to coil and slumber or simply to wait. As long as she’s touching reasonably pliant ground, she may sink into it, entombing herself just below the surface. She cannot be seen or heard without using applicable magic, such as hearing her heartbeat with Knowing Beyond Silence or sensing her presence with Feeling the Dragon’s Bones (p. 173). She can still be tracked by scent, but her trail ends abruptly at the point where she vanished into the earth. While entombed, the Dragon-Blood cannot use her senses or move without the use of appropriate Charms. She could eavesdrop through a layer of topsoil with Deep-Listening Palm (p. 172), detect the presence of anyone within range with All-Encompassing Earth Sense (p. 172), or move underground with One-WithEarth Embodiment (p. 174). She buries herself along with enough air to breathe for five minutes, after which she must hold her breath or make use of Charms such as Unbreathing Earth Meditation (p. 248). When this Charm ends, the Dragon-Blood emerges from the earth in a great plume of dust that she can hide within. She may expend her Earth Aura through the dust plume to blind all enemies in short range for one scene unless they succeed on a (Stamina + Awareness) roll at difficulty 3. Blinded characters must spend three Initiative and a turn washing out their eyes to regain sight. An Essence 5 repurchase of this Charm lets the Dragon-Blood descend into solid rock as long as it’s natural, unworked stone. She could embed herself in the wall of a cavern or a mountain overhang, but not the stone floor of a dungeon. She may expend her Earth Aura when she emerges from solid rock to unleash a spray of stone shrapnel that both blinds enemies as above and acts as a one-time environmental hazard out to short range from the Dragon-Blood with Damage 3L and a difficulty equal to (the lowest of her Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina).
