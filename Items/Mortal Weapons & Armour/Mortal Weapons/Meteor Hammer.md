Cost: 
Special: After attacking with a meteor hammer or rope dart, a character may pull it back to their hand with a miscellaneous action. With 3+ extra successes on the attack roll, this can be done reflexively. This isn’t compatible with magic that extends the attack’s range unless the nature of the effect would still let the wielder pull back the rope or chain.
