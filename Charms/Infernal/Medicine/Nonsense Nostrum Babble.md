*In a world of toxins, blight, and charlatans, few are lucky enough to have a physician as trustworthy as the Infernal.*

When the Infernal offers or provides medical treatment or advice to others, her self-evident expertise causes others to count as having Minor Tie of trust to her. Any penalties she suffers on influence rolls for making implausible claims about medicine, ailments, or the like are reduced by (Essence).

If the Infernal succeeds on a difficulty 3+ Medicine roll to treat a patient, he gains a Minor Principle based on a distrust of medicine in general or of physicians, healers, and their ilk — except the Infernal, of course.
