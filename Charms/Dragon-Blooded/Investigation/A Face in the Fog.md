*The Dragon-Blood draws information from the flow of [[Essence]] through a crime scene, calling up a vision of her suspect from the murky depths of the past.*
When she succeeds on a [[case scene]] roll opposed by another character’s attempt at concealing evidence, she may activate this Charm. For a moment, her perception of the space around her is filled with a thick, heavy mist. She catches a glimpse of the perpetrator in the mist — not enough to recognize him, but sufficient to convey some combination of height and build, gender, age, or other distinctive features. If the Dragon-Blood encounters the perpetrator, a successful [[profile character]] roll allows her to confirm that he’s the one she saw. Upon doing so, she gains a point of [[Willpower]].
