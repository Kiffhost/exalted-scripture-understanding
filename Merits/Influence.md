This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
This Merit reflects a character’s standing and pull in society. It might derive from political office, notoriety, leadership of an organization, military conquest, or from awe or fear of the character’s displayed power. Whatever the reason, people take heed of the character’s wants and will. Most Exalted eventually gain some degree of [[Influence]], if they don’t start with it.
One dot describes a figure of local note—a tribal family head, a respected physician, a known sorcerer, or the owner of a very popular teahouse.
Two dots describes a figure of some pull in the city-state or satrapy where he resides—a politically connected magistrate, a shipping magnate, a mercenary company leader with an important contract.
Three dots describes an influential character, very important to the region in which he resides: a royal advisor, a general, a tribal chief, a merchant prince with investments everywhere in the region.
Four dots describes a major regional power, whose words carry great weight, and who may possibly rule a small city directly. This also represents leaders of tribal alliances, the right hands of princes, and [[Lunar Exalted]] who openly live as gods.
Five dots describes a character of vast influence, likely the ruler of a city-state with influence on neighboring principalities. Alternately, the character might be a widely-feared warlord, or the Lunar god-king of an all-consuming horde.
It is possible, though difficult, to cultivate [[Influence]] of different sorts in multiple regions simultaneously.

#### Dragon-Blooded
Dragon-Blooded most often hold [[Influence]] within their family, be it a Great House, a Lookshyan gens (p. 112), or a Prasadi clan (p. 26). It’s also common to have [[Influence]] in the locale where they reside or somewhere they’ve performed great deeds in the past, or via their Immaculate denomination.
