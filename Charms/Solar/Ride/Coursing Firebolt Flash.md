*The Lawgiver whips her reins and strikes against the world with her [[Essence]], pushing aside all external forces to drive her mount forward with blistering speed.*
This Charm supplements a rush, disengage, or withdraw action (p. 197), or a single interval of a race (p. 197), adding one automatic success and rerolling all 1s until 1s fail to appear. For four motes, the Solar may unfurl a single level of her anima, leaving a trail of fire in her wake. This flame will not consume the scenery, but will burn steadily, for an hour, even in a driving rain, and does damage identical to a bonfire (p. 230). These flame trails are visible from a mile away, and can be seen by completely sightless characters. When using [[Coursing Firebolt Flash]], and provided she knows [[Onrush Burst Method]] (p. 264), the Solar benefits from the latter Charm exactly as if she were using [[Athletics]], save that she must use the gathered motes to power [[Ride]] [[Charms]].
