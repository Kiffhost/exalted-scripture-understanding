*The Sidereal brandishes a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden in Terror, which glows a sickly green as it twists and sinks into her palm, leaving a faint tracery of emerald symbols that spell out someone’s doom.*
The Sidereal rolls (Intelligence + Lore) against the Resolve of a character within short range, revealing a misfortune the future holds in store for him. The Sidereal’s player proposes a general description of the fate that will befall him if she succeeds, though that doom’s severity won’t be determined until after she rolls. Her target adds his Essence to his Resolve as a non-Charm bonus, and his Intimacies modify his Resolve against the Sidereal’s roll if they support or oppose the doom.
Success assures that the victim’s doom will come to pass.
The Sidereal’s player should work with the Storyteller to define its details. Catastrophic, life-changing disasters are valid options: spending 10 years lost at sea, being murdered by his own daughter, killing his closest friend. However, her prediction can’t directly imperil anyone other than her target unless they’re mortal or trivial characters, and even then, only in small numbers.
The Sidereal also can’t foretell any positive consequences for her victim.
The Sidereal’s victim has at least (his base Resolve + 5) days before any events will be set in motion, though some dooms may take much longer to come to pass.
During this time, he can seek to break the prophecy with applicable magic or prepare for his doom. The Sidereal must commit this Charm’s cost for this interval; if she ends it prematurely or is killed, the doom subsides from an inevitability to a mere possibility.
The doom is sure to happen, though the specifics may vary from the player’s description based on how events unfold in play, but fate will adapt to whatever happens to ensure her victim faces that doom in some meaningful form. However, the victim can mitigate the overall harm and impact of this doom with successful rolls, creative thinking, assistance from his allies, and other assets. This prophecy can influence the lives and decisions of mortal characters in addition to its target as necessary to bring that doom to pass, but it can’t force the Exalted and other supernatural beings to do anything unless their player agrees. The Sidereal has no conscious choice in the matter; she simply reveals what is inevitable.
## Reset
Once per story, unless by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) or by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
