*Through trial and tribulation, the Solar learns to endure the greatest tests of her resolve.*
With this Charm, the Solar may convert four motes to one point of [[Willpower]], even if this puts her above her permanent [[Willpower]] rating. She may do this at any time she perceives it necessary, but may only use this Charm outside combat, and only once per scene. This power can be reset by successfully resisting any form of social influence or psychic torment while at a penalty or other disadvantage. Being tortured by captors, interrogated by authorities, or tormented by powerful or strange beings all count as disadvantages.
