*The Sidereal makes a habit of contemplating potential relationships, concealing her true feelings behind imagined passions.*
After successfully asserting [[Guile]] against a read intentions roll, the Sidereal can use this Charm, causing the opposing character to believe he succeeded. However, instead of the truth, he perceives a result that conveys or implies that someone else in the scene, chosen by the Sidereal, has power over her. She chooses what this relationship appears to be: romantic entanglement, a student-teacher relationship, debt, etc.
