Offering up an efficacious prayer, the Dragon-Blood casts an offering into the fire, beseeching a spirit’s favor in exchange for the pleasing scent of smoke. She makes a persuade roll with any social Ability, doubling 7s, to influence a spirit in person, or to offer up a prayer through any fire. A prayer made from afar will always be heard if the sacrifice is made in the spirit’s temple or overseen by one of its priests; otherwise, the Storyteller determines whether the spirit hears the offer. The intensity of any of the spirit’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that support the influence is treated as one step higher when determining the level of task it’s willing to accept (Exalted, p. 216). Even if it has no applicable [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], she treats it as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards her that supports the influence. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) by interacting with spirits. If the Dragon-Blood’s prayer isn’t heard, no reset is necessary.
