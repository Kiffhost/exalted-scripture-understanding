The Sidereal destroys not matter but the force that moves it, negating speed and momentum. The Sidereal makes an unarmed ([[Strength]] + [Athletics, [[Brawl]], or Martial Arts]) gambit, with difficulty 6. If she succeeds, all her victimâ€™s movement counts as being in difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) for that scene. This Charm can also be used against inanimate objects in motion, like a barrel rolling downhill or a ship on the sea. The attack roll is made at difficulty 1-5, based on how easy it is to touch the object; the [[Initiative]] roll and cost are waived. Success halves the speed at which it moves for the scene.
