# Fire Dragon Style
Fire Dragon style demands both the capacity for unpredictable violence and immense self-discipline. Its students train in the rhythm of combat, sparring and performing weapon drills in time to music. Walkers on the path of Hesiesh fight with incredible speed and a dancerâ€™s grace, knowing when to withhold their force and when to unleash it without restraint.
## Weapons
Fire Dragon unarmed attacks are rapid barrages of punches and chops, as well as powerful kicks. The style also uses short swords, traditionally wielded paired. Unarmed attacks enhanced by Fire Dragon Charms can be stunted to deal lethal damage.
## Armour
This style is compatible with light and medium armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
Occult is vital to subduing unruly gods.
