*Death’s Lawgiver enacts an unquestionable decree, suffusing her dread authority with the weight of the Old Laws.*
The Abyssal enacts a law, rule, or regulation, conferring Accursed Overlord Authority’s effect on it and imbuing it with one of her Defining Principles. The Abyssal doesn’t have to proclaim it by her own authority — she only needs to be involved in its enactment. The law affects all who read or hear it within a region who are subject to its authority. It also affects mindless undead.
Written codifications of the law bleed through any covering placed over them. The words outlast even physical destruction — if a carved stone stele is shattered, the Abyssal’s edict lingers in the very air.
