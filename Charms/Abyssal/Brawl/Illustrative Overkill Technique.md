*The deathknight cows her foes with grotesque feats of ecstatic violence.*
When the Abyssal’s decisive attack incapacitates a nontrivial opponent, she can use this Charm to make a ([[Strength]] + [[Brawl]]) threaten roll, adding any excess levels of damage beyond her enemy’s remaining health levels as non-Charm successes. Resisting this influence costs one [[Willpower]] and [[Initiative]] equal to the Abyssal’s extra successes over the target’s [[Resolve]]. If the slain enemy was especially powerful, like an Exalt, this influence costs an additional [[Willpower]] to resist. The same is true if the Abyssal’s attack caused narratively significant destruction, like destroying a landmark with [[Screaming Victim Demolition]].
Alternatively, the Abyssal can use this Charm on her turn to reflexively kill a trivial opponent within her weapon’s range. She makes a threaten roll, but doesn’t receive any of the benefits above. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round, but she can only do so once per turn.
