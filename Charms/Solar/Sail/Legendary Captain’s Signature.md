The Exalt fashions her skill into a perfect [[Essence]]-fueled maneuver. The Solar’s naval skill is such that she can overcome a ship’s design flaws. Even a trash barge moves like a sleek pirate cutter in her capable hands. This Charm supplements a naval maneuver, doubling the ship’s maneuverability rating and increasing its speed by one. If the ship’s rating is zero or less, its rating increases to one.
