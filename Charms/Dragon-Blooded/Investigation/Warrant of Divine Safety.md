*Dragon-Blooded magistrates may bind the wicked to their words, capturing a carelessly offered oath or negotiated concession from the air into which it’s spoken and sealing it with [[Essence]].*
She can use this Charm to sanctify any spoken offer made to her of hospitality or of invitation into a building. The invitation must be made by a character with customary authority to do so, even if informal — a guest at a noble’s court could extend hospitality to a stranger, and even a palace servant might welcome her in discreetly, but a thief or trespasser cannot give a valid invitation. 
As long as the Dragon-Blood and her companions take no hostile actions, other characters cannot violate the guarantee of hospitality without incurring Heaven’s wrath. An attacker’s knife might be blown from his hand by a sudden gust of wind, elemental spirits might appear to restrain an oath-breaker from violence, or a bolt of lightning might strike a would-be poisoner on his way to the kitchen. Whatever consequences the Storyteller introduces should be commensurate to the violation and sufficiently dire to negate most oathbreakers’ attempts at harming those under this Charm’s protection. 
Characters with an [[Essence]] higher than the Dragon-Blood’s can attempt to fight despite these consequences, but still face significant obstacles — large penalties, [[environmental hazards]], or similar. 
This protection is limited to the premises on which she was offered hospitality. It doesn’t extend beyond the bounds of that location — offering no protection for those outside — and ends if the Dragon-Blood leaves the premises.
