The Sidereal shamelessly trades on someone else’s good name. The Sidereal gains the following benefits when disguising herself as someone who’s name she’s stolen. 
-  She ignores the penalty for impersonating unfamiliar people. 
-  Rolls against her disguise suffer +1 target number. 
-  She can flawlessly mimic her target’s voice and handwriting. 
-  She can use Masque of the Uncanny to enhance the disguise.
