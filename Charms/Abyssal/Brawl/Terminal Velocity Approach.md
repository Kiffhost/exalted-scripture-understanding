*The deathknight grants her enemy the mercy of a swift release from her grasp, sending him to meet his end.*
When the Abyssal throws a grappled enemy, she can hurl him out to short range and increases how many rounds of control she can benefit from to (Essence + Strength + 4). The enemy adds his base wound penalty to the difficulty to rise from prone and must always roll to do so. If the Abyssal uses this Charm after grappling an enemy with Titan-Murdering Grasp (p. XX), she can throw even Legendary Size enemies.
With Essence 3, the Abyssal can expend two rounds of control to extend the throw’s range to medium, inflicting damage as a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232) instead of adding damage with them. This doesn’t stack with falling damage from other effects, like Lashing Tempest Palm. If she expends four rounds, she can throw her enemy to long range and inflict damage as a medium-range fall.
