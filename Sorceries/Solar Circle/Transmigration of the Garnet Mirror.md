*The sorcerer creates a domain within which things cease to be real, existing only as unrealized potential for five days before this doomed half-reality collapses back into its original state.*

She must stand at the highest point within the area to be affected, which can encompass up to (Essence x 20) square miles, turning a red-stained mirror to face the four cardinal directions for one hour each before raising it toward the skies and offering the Prayers of the Resentful Heart. At that moment, the region and everything within it is drawn into a strange parascape. This has the following effects:
- The area is completely cut off from outside. No one can leave, and those who try find themselves inexplicably looping back. Nothing from the outside can enter, likewise finding their path distorted. This applies to magic as well, such as teleportation and summoning. Inanimate natural phenomena such as clouds and rivers are not interrupted, flowing seemingly from nowhere.
- The world outside is completely imperceptible. Looking outward reveals only vague contours of what should be there. Scrying and similar magic to observe the outside world completely fails.
- The sky is pitch black, with no stars or sun. A swirling garnet moon hangs in the sky, neither rising nor setting — instead, it fully waxes and wanes each day. During the day, the full moon’s light is as bright as daylight; at night, the new moon casts the region into darkness.
- All writing is transformed and translated into a mirrored form of Old Realm script. Characters can read this text normally as if fluent in Old Realm.
- Sidereal Divination Charms and similar prophetic magic returns garbled nonsense, referencing the future as the past and forecasting mutual impossibilities. Beyond five days, it offers nothing at all.
- Characters other than the sorcerer won’t recognize or acknowledge these oddities as anything unusual. If confronted, they’ll explain them away as a result of unseasonal weather, road collapses, mass hysteria, and so on. This stubborn denial counts as a Defining Principle.

When this spell ends, the area and everything within it return to reality. They revert to the exact same state as when the sorcerer cast the spell, as though the previous five days never happened: destroyed buildings return to their original condition; a disease’s progression is undone; wine that was drunk is back in its bottle; those who died are alive.

Only the sorcerer remembers what happened during the spell’s duration. She can restore other characters’ memories by touching them and spending one mote. The reversion applies to Intimacies that were created, weakened, or strengthened during the five days. Characters presented with evidence of what happened can spend one Willpower to regain their memories of the parascape for a scene; when they have spent three Willpower in total, they retain their memories forever.

A given area may only be affected by this spell once per year.
# Control
The sorcerer’s eyes are blank red orbs, and she weeps bloody tears while sleeping. She can exclude specific characters from this spell’s area by speaking their names while casting it. They do not appear within the parascape, displaced outside the borders by distorted pathways or bizarre coincidence. Their absence is overlooked like the spell’s other oddities. She can shorten the spell’s duration to as little as five hours and may specify a condition that will cause it to end early, such as the finale of a local festival or the death of a particular character.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 25)
The sorcerer forgets events within the parascape like everyone else once this spell concludes and can’t restore other character’s memories.
