*The Sidereal tosses a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Eternal Maiden to dance in the wind about her, casting off shapeless golden phantasms as her consciousness spreads throughout the land.*
As long as the Sidereal can see her prayer strip, her senses are magnified, granting the following benefits: 
- She can make [[Perception]]-based rolls out to ([[Perception]]) miles from the prayer strip. 
- She’s aware of all [[Survival]] rolls within her sense’s range and can grant −1 or +1 target number. 
- She can communicate mentally with any animal or spirit within her sense’s range without needing a shared language. 
- She can convince animals and spirits to act against someone she can perceive with a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Survival]]) roll. This both instills them with a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of hatred toward that character and persuades them to act against him in some way, supported by the instilled [[Intimacy]] and requiring a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] to resist as usual. Animals can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist unless they’re someone’s familiar or are otherwise magically empowered. 
- She can pay three motes to use [[Tomb-Parole Sanction]] reflexively while awake, experiencing both her senses and her host’s rather than turning to stone. She can use it on multiple hosts. If she perceives the same thing through multiple hosts, she makes one roll but adds dice equal to the effective [[Size]] of that group (Exalted, p. 206) and ignores penalties that don’t affect all hosts. 
- If she knows [[Wilderness-Commanding Practice]], she can use it on any natural feature she perceives regardless of distance. It costs only five motes when used for changes that can be completed instantly. The prayer strip is clearly visible for a mile; noticing it from further away requires a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll. Weather and other environmental conditions can’t obscure it.
