*The Shatterbond Knives cannot stand to be parted long.*
The wielder pulls an enemy affected by [[Gift of Pain]] toward her with an unblockable gambit. Its difficulty depends on the enemy’s range: 1 for short range, 2 for medium, and 3 for long (enemies beyond long range can’t be affected). Against her rival, she adds attack roll extra successes on the [[Initiative]] roll Success drags the target up to two range bands towards the wielder. If this leaves him within close range of the wielder, she may reflexively make a withering or decisive attack against him.
## Dissonant
This Evocation can’t affect enemies beyond short range, or medium range for the wielder’s rival.
