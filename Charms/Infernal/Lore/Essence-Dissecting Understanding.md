*The secrets of the cosmos and its grand design are laid bare by the Infernal’s piercing insight.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on Lore and Occult rolls that involve understanding the nature and behavior of Essence, including sorcery, geomancy, artifice and the like. This only enhances her understanding — it doesn’t aid in casting spells, performing sorcerous workings, or similar fests.
- She regains (lower of Essence or Lore) additional motes each hour.
- She gains greater control of her anima banner, letting her halve the time it takes for it to fade. (Exalted, p. 175).
- She can always tell what realm of existence she’s in.
