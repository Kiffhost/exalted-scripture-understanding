This unusual stone appears chalky-white while held, but assumes the same hue as the dominant magical material of an artifact it’s socketed into. While socketed into an attuned artifact, it awakens the next Evocation for which the artifact’s bearer qualifies. Note she cannot naturally proceed to learn the next Evocation in the tree using this hearthstone’s Evocation as a prerequisite. She must first complete any requisite training required and learn the
Evocation with her own experience points in order to advance to the next Evocation.
