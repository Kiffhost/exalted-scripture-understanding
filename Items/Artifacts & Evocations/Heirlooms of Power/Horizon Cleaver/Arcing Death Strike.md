*The wielder may pay two motes to attack an enemy at [[Range|short range]] when she uses [[Brilliant Reproach]].*
This also increases the range at which it can strike random targets if she fails to control the attack. 

## Resonant

At [[Essence]] 3, a wielder who resonates with jade may extend its range to medium for a four-mote surcharge. At [[Essence]] 4, she may pay a four-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to extend its range to long.
