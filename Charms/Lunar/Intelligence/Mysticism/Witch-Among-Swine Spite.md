Those who anger the Lunar meet humbling transformations, trapping them in shapes better suited to their crude demeanors. When she’s wronged by a character she has a negative Major or Defining Tie toward — e.g., he attacks her or an ally, breaks a promise, trespasses on her land, insults her, etc. — she can use Insidious Lunar Transformation on him while he’s within medium range without feeding him her blood, and waiving its health level cost. She must use it in the same scene the slight occurs.
