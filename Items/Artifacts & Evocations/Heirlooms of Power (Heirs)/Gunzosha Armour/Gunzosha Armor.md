*Ancient wonders of the First Age, gunzosha armor are more akin to [[Essence]]-powered armored exoskeletons than the artifact armors donned by the Second Age’s Exalted.*
They’re puissant relics in the hands of the Chosen, but can also be attuned by mortals, allowing the First Age’s warlords to field entire armies of gunzosha. But this power carries a high price. Before a mortal can attune to gunzosha armor, she must have jade amulets surgically implanted across her body, allowing her to control the armor and draining her [[Essence]] to power it. As long as the amulets remain implanted, the rate at which she ages is doubled.
Lookshy’s arsenal boasts dozens of suits of gunzosha armor, more than any other single power in Creation. Seventh Legion military doctrine deploys gunzosha as elite troops reinforcing the field forces, attaching a fang of five gunzosha to a dragon, while also occasionally fielding smaller gunzosha detachments to support Dragon-Blooded officers.
However, Lookshy’s store of gunzosha armor is too small to allow every field force to have a full gunzosha complement; the Stores Directorate and the Directorate of the Adjutant-General coordinate unit allocation. The Stores Directorate is keenly aware of gunzosha armor’s irreplaceability and is loath to deploy gunzosha in circumstances where a fallen warrior’s armor might not be retrievable.
Lookshyan gunzosha candidates are selected from the field forces by the Directorate of the Adjutant-General, though service has not been compulsory outside of some of the darkest times in Lookshyan history. Given the severe toll the armor takes from its wearers, the General Staff’s current policy sets a ten-year maximum term of service, after which the gunzosha’s amulets are surgically removed. Gunzosha and former gunzosha hold considerable prestige in Lookshyan culture; their sacrifice exemplifies the Immaculate Faith’s Pillar of Conviction. The Seventh Legion’s Dragon-Blooded may not consider the gunzosha their equals, but few are without a healthy respect for them.
Gunzosha armor is heavy and ornate, made up of bulky, overlapping plates that cover the wearer’s entire body. These plates are inlaid with flowing script spelling out prayers for victory in battle and protection. The underside of each plate is covered with fine capillaries that act as an extension of the wearer’s musculature and route [[Essence]] from her implanted amulets to the armor — wonders beyond the Second Age’s artificers. Most of the gunzosha armors in Lookshy’s arsenal are primarily constructed from jade, but suits forged from other magical materials still exist today.
Gunzosha armor is heavy artifact armor (Exalted, p. 599). Mortals must pay five [[Willpower]] to attune to it, in place of committing motes. All of them share the universal gunzosha [[Evocations]] below, depicting the wearer’s proficiency with the armor’s integrated mechanisms, but each is still a unique and storied treasure, with unique [[Evocations]] reflecting its specific legend.
Like any other artifact armor, its rating can range from three dots to the fabled [[Artifact]] N/As, determining the power and number of that armor’s unique [[Evocations]].
## Gunzosha [[Evocations]] 
The following [[Evocations]] are possessed by all gunzosha armor.
# BECOMING A GUNZOSHA
Creating the jade amulets necessary for a mortal to attune to gunzosha armor is a major project (Exalted, p. 240) that requires [[Craft]] ([[Artifact]]). Surgically implanting them is a difficulty 3 ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) roll that inflicts a level of unpreventable lethal damage.
# GUNZOSHA AND RESONANCE 
For artifacts such as gunzosha armor that allow mortals to attune them, mortal wielders are considered dissonant regardless of the materials the artifact is made from.
