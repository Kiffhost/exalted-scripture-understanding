The inexorable [[Essence]] of fire blazes in the Dragon-Blood’s steed as it gallops at full speed towards its goal, leaving a trail of burning hoofprints behind it. After a successful mounted rush, if the rushed foe provokes the Dragon-Blood’s reflexive movement, she ignites a fiery environmental hazard along her path, with difficulty 4 and Damage ([[Essence]])L/round. It continues to burn until her next turn, although the Storyteller may deem that terrain such as dry grass continues to burn for a full scene.
