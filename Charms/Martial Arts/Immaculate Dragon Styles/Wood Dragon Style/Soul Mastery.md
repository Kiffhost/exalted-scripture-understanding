*Standing at the center of life and death, the Immaculate unleashes the legendary secret technique of Wood Dragon style. A swirling black-green aura wreathes her weapon as she strikes at her opponent’s very soul.* 
This Charm can only be used against an enemy suffering from the Immaculate’s [[Soul-Marking Style]]. She rolls a gambit against him, with a difficulty of (his [[Essence]] + [[Willpower]] − wound penalty), minimum 6. Success destroys him utterly. 
Spirits are permanently destroyed, the undead crumble into dust, and the living die as their souls are struck into Lethe, ensuring that they’ll reincarnate rather than lingering as ghosts. Constructs and similar beings neither living or dead are unaffected. 
## Reset
[[Soul Mastery]] can only be used once per scene.
