*The Infernal is versed in Hell’s forbidden lore, heedless of law and morality in her pursuit of knowledge.*

The Infernal adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice and doubles 9s on a Lore roll. If she rolls to introduce a fact with the intention of using that knowledge to cause someone physical or emotional harm in the current scene, she doubles 8s instead.

If the Infernal succeeds on a difficulty 3+ roll, she gains a Lore background in a relevant topic (Exalted, p. 153). Normally, this doesn’t grant her a Lore specialty. However, once per story, she may gain a specialty matching the chosen Lore background at no experience point cost.
## [[Keys]]
#### Blasphemous Wisdom Grimoire (Lore 3)
The Infernal doubles 8s on rolls to introduce facts that will help her support one of her negative Major or Defining Principles. Once per session, she can use a negative Defining Principle as if it were a Lore background on a related topic.
#### Hell-Lore Esoterica (Lore 4, Essence 2)
If the roll relates to one of the Infernal’s Lore backgrounds, the added dice are non-Charm.
#### Insuperable Wickedness Genius (Lore 5, [[#Hell-Lore Esoterica (Lore 4, Essence 2)|Hell-Lore Esoterica]])
When the Infernal rolls to introduce or challenge a fact, she rolls an additional non-Charm die for each doubled success, to a maximum of (Essence) additional dice.
#### Twisted Genius Epiphany (Lore 5, Essence 3, [[#Blasphemous Wisdom Grimoire (Lore 3)|Blasphemous Wisdom Grimoire]])
Rolls that receive double 8s from this Charm don’t count against the once-per-scene limit on introducing facts.
