*The Solar’s passionate appeals can soften even the stoniest of hearts.*
This Charm supplements an instill or persuade action, granting the Solar one automatic success and additionally granting one non-Charm bonus die for every two points the target’s [[Resolve]] is boosted by any means. The Solar cannot gain more than three bonus dice in this fashion.
