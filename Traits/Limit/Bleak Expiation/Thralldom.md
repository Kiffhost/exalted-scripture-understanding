Thralldom usurps the Abyssal’s will, holding her to the vows she’s sworn. It compels the Abyssal to do something that either upholds death’s chivalry, exemplifies her Caste’s role, or otherwise serves the Neverborn’s will. The Thralldom’s level determines what level of task it can compel (Exalted, p. 216): inconvenient tasks at Minor, serious tasks at Major, and life-changing tasks at Defining.
Thralldom can only compel acts that the Abyssal could complete in the current or next scene. It can’t force her to act against an Intimacy whose intensity equals or exceeds the Expiation’s, nor can it compel anything would be [[unacceptable influence]] (Exalted, p. 220).
