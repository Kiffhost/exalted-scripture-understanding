*The earth quakes at the Lunarâ€™s advance.*
She adds an automatic success on a rush. If her target provokes her reflexive movement and she pursues with a leap, the shockwave force of her landing knocks him prone. All other enemies within close range of her when she lands must roll ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]]) opposing her rush roll or fall prone. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Leaping Pounce, the added success is non-Charm.
