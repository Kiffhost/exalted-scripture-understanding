*Whirling silver sands flay away the Infernal’s material form: peeling away layers of ephemeral flesh, stripping pulsating meat and slimy viscera from bone, and finally reducing bone to dust.*

The Infernal dematerializes in a disquieting display. She can choose to remain visible as an apparition of swirling sand or sizzling rain, or render herself imperceptible, as most dematerialized beings are. She can pay one mote to reflexively change between these options. At bonfire anima, she becomes visible and must remain so until her anima recedes. She can dematerialize even in spiritual realms like Malfeas.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has [[Dematerialized Form]] (p. XX), she gains +2 Evasion while in it and can perfectly dodge any attack that isn’t enhanced by magic even while partially material.
## [[Keys]]
#### Stone-Flayer Touch (Essence 4) (1m or 1m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay one mote to affect materialized characters or objects with a single action. This costs one mote and one Willpower for attacks against nontrivial enemies.
#### Soul-Sand Devil Incarnation (Essence 5, [[#Stone-Flayer Touch (Essence 4) (1m or 1m, 1wp)|Stone-Flayer Touch]])
The Infernal gains this Charm’s benefits permanently. She can activate it to materialize, reversing its grotesque transformation. This extends its duration to Indefinite.
