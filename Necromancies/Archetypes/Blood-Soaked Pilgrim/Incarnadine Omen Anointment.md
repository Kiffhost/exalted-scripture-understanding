*While the necromancer proudly presents herself in bloodied clothes and smeared markings, she gains one necromantic mote at the start of each scene.*
She gains another for a successful [[instill]] or [[inspire]] roll against a crowd or significant character which convinces them to explore her spiritual and philosophical beliefs. She may bank up to ([[Charisma]] + [[Occult]]) such motes at a time.
