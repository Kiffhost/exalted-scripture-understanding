Listening to the song of someone’s heart, the Sidereal hears the notes missing from its harmony. The Sidereal makes a (Perception + Performance) reads intentions roll. If she and her target are dancing or sharing physical intimacy, her Appearance adds bonus dice, as with influence rolls. If she succeeds, the target’s player tells her player what he needs to hear and who he needs to hear it from before he can find happiness, contentment, or hope in the face of the most urgent distress he faces. She doesn’t learn what this distress is. Making this happen counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX).
