*The Abyssal ends her enemies’ dreams of defeating her, shrugging off their every attack.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after being hit by a withering attack, before its damage roll. All withering damage she suffers for this Charm’s duration is halved, rounded up.
With [[Essence]] 3, enemies who hit the Abyssal with a withering attack lose [[Initiative]] equal to the 1s on their attack rolls, maximum (Abyssal’s Stamina/2, rounded up). With [[Essence]] 4, the Abyssal gains this [[Initiative]].
