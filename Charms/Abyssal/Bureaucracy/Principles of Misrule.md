*The Abyssal is well-versed in the failings of the living and dead alike, citing their vices with ministerial scorn.*
The Abyssal can use Bureaucracy specialties as Lore backgrounds to challenge or introduce facts, substituting Bureaucracy for Lore when she does. She doesn’t need a specialty for facts closely related to her backstory or experiences, like the markets of a merchant prince’s homeland.
The Abyssal doubles 9s if the fact involves corruption, deceptive business practices, or other bureaucratic wrongdoing or if it involves the Underworld or the undead. She doubles 8s if it involves both.
