Some Infernal Charms have keys that unlock greater power. Keys are Charms that permanently upgrade the Charm they’re listed beneath. They’re still Charms for all purposes — they’re listed as keys purely for clarity and ease of reference. Some keys have no cost; those that do list their cost or surcharge.
