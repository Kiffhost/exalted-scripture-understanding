*The [[Underworld]]’s truths can sometimes be glimpsed in the arrangement of ossuary bones, the veneration of ancestors, and the placement of tombs.*
Death’s geomancy intrudes upon [[Creation]], most famously in its [[shadowlands]], but also in those stark and hallowed places where the Old Laws seep up like metaphysical groundwater. Necromancers who learn to harness this power can call upon the power of graveyards and reverence for the dead to fuel spells and workings of necromantic might.
