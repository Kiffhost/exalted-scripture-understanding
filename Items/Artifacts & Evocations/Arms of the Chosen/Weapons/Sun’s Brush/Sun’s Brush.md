Once, the old legends say, the sun shone with a stark white radiance, devoid of wholesome yellow warmth or the many-colored splendor of sunset. They say that Arajati, the many-armed god of art, had fallen in love with the Unconquered Sun, and painted the sun’s rays with the many colors of his brush to woo him. The Sun’s paramour — a figure whose identity changes from telling to telling — killed Arajati for his transgression and sent his brush falling to Creation. The fallen brush was found by a Twilight Caste savant and philosopher. Seeking to preserve Arajati’s passion and story, he forged it into a weapon, an orichalcum naginata built around the brush at its core. Sun’s Brush becomes a teacher to its wielder, guiding her towards wisdom and self-revelation. Its greatest powers are attainable only by thosewhoseetheworldwithalegendaryscholar’sinsight. Sun’s Brush is currently guarded by a monastic order of scholars, who tend to one of Creation’s greatest libraries in thefrozendepthsofaruinedtowerbuiltatthedawnoftime. It’s said they await the coming of a candidate able to pass theirtrialsofknowledgeandcunningtoclaimtheweapon. 
 
## Evocations of Sun’s Brush

Sun’s Brush serves as a writing implement as well as a weapon. It has an illimitable supply of gold ink, and its blade-tip is capable of writing on any surface not warded by nigh-impervious magic. Using Sun’s Brush to write on an enemy is a difficulty 2 foe-scribing gambit. If the wielder includes social influence in this message, she adds one non-Charm die on her Linguistics roll for every threshold success on the gambit’s Initiative roll. These markings can eventually be washed away, but always last at least (Essence) days.
