The finest armorers create weapons and suits of armor superior to anything lesser craftsmen can make. Exceptional armor and weapons provide no bonuses, but are exquisitely made, often elaborately decorated or sufficiently durable they require only minimal care. 

Other forms of exceptional equipment also exist. A burglar might have exceptional lockpicks created by the finest master thief in Nexus, and a musician might have a flute or lyre made by a brilliant crafter who also makes musical instruments for the best performers in the Realm. All exceptional equipment other than weapons and armor provides a +1 bonus to all rolls to use it. All exceptional equipment costs one dot more than ordinary equipment. All artifacts are by definition exceptional, so artifact traits already take any bonuses from exceptional construction into account.
