*Once per day, when the wielder sleeps, she rolls ([[Perception]] + {Investigation or Socialize}) against the [[Guile]] of a character she’s successfully examined with [[Soul-Piercing Lens]] that day.*
Success reveals a piece of valuable information about him — a forthcoming plan, flash of his history, etc. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience. It awakens for free when the wielder discovers evidence of a previously unknown plot against her or someone to whom she has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]].
