A character who wishes to hide an item or cover her tracks after a crime can do so with a conceal evidence action, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[Larceny]]) as a dramatic action that takes fifteen minutes. The Storyteller should note how many successes she rolls, and apply it as the difficulty of any case scene actions used to search that area. To save time, the Storyteller does not need to roll for evidence concealed by NPCs, but can simply assume the difficulty is equal to that characterâ€™s [[Larceny]] rating.
