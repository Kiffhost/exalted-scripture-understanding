*The Immaculate’s strike is Mela’s exhalation, driving her foes back with the force of fivefold winds.*
She doubles 10s on a decisive damage roll. If she deals damage, she may knock her enemy prone and hurl him one range band away from her. With 3+ levels of damage, she may hurl him two range bands instead. He cannot be flung further than long range from the Immaculate. 
In Air Aura, any damage is enough to knock an enemy back two range bands. With 5+ levels, the Immaculate may knock an enemy back three range bands.
