The Lunar invites others to embrace their rage, teaching them to draw strength from it and bend it to their ends.
The Lunar interacts with someone in a way that involves anger: provoking him into a fight, talking about the roots of her own rage, telling a story of a legendary berserker-hero, etc.
She imbues that character’s anger with formidable power.
That character gains the following benefits while acting in accordance with a Major or Defining Intimacy based on anger or hatred, or while inspired with such emotions by social influence:  - A bonus dot of Strength, which can raise his Strength above 5.
 - He ignores one point of wound penalty.
 - +2 Resolve against influence to weaken ragebased Intimacies or to convince him to withdraw from combat.
 - If the Lunar uses Rampage-Unleashing Provocation on him, he adds one bonus die on all physical actions and threaten rolls.
Descended from Luna’s Chosen, the Moon-Touched (Lunars, p. 18) are heirs to their rage. No extended interaction is required to use this Charm on MoonTouched, and it costs only one mote, one Willpower to use on un-Exalted Moon-Touched.
