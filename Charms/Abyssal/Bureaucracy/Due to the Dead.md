*Debts to Death’s Lawgiver weigh heavy on the soul.*
When the Abyssal makes an instill, persuade, or threaten roll with Presence or Socialize, she can leverage debts that a target owes to her or an organization she represents as if they were Intimacies. A debt’s effective intensity depends on what it would take to pay off, either with a Resources expenditure (Exalted, p. 578) or by performing a task (Exalted, p. 216).
### Minor
An expenditure lower than the target’s Resources rating or an inconvenient task.
### Major
An expenditure up to one dot higher than the target’s Resources rating or a serious task.
### Defining
An expenditure at least two dots higher than the target’s Resources rating or a life-changing task.
The debt need not be real or legitimate, but the character must believe he owes it.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used against a character once per scene.
