Holding the Revelation Sphere to her chest as she sleeps, the wielder dreams of an otherworldly maze of ice, chasing her unknown goal through its gelid passageways. She rolls (Perception + [Integrity, Lore, or Occult]) and banks her successes. She can add up to (Essence) of these successes on any of the following rolls:
 - Any roll enhanced by the Revelation Sphere’s equipment bonus.
 - Introduce fact rolls.
 - Shape Sorcery rolls.
 - Any spell effect roll made as part of casting a spell that enhances the sorcerer’s senses, scries on distant things, or divines the past or future.
 - Any roll (or her Resolve) to see through illusions.
 - Any roll to endure cold temperatures or coldbased magic.
This Evocation can only be used once per day.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens for free when a Dragon-Blooded Amilar scion attunes to the Revelation Sphere.
## Resonant
The wielder may spend banked successes in place of motes when paying the costs of Instantduration Charms enhancing the above rolls. Successes spent this way don’t count toward the limit that can be added on the roll.
