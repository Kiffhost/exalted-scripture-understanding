# [[#Devil-Prince Sword Style]]
Devil-Prince Sword style maims and terrifies before it kills, a wicked art created by ancient Lintha corsairs and refined across bloodstained centuries by their piratical kin. Wielding a serrated auzhian blade, a skilled practitioner is capable of a dozen different expressions of violence with each movement. The Lintha Sword Princes claim to be its true masters, challenging terrible foes and mastering equally perilous techniques to elevate their position within the Lintha family. Many fall in glorious death; this rarely deters other practitioners — though it may be encouragement to stack the odds in their favor before facing such potent enemies or risky maneuvers.

While the Sword Princes and their blood-soaked auzhians are the style’s true heirs, many reavers across the Western ocean and along the Southern coasts practice archaic or bastardized techniques, using hatchets and cruder blades as part of their traditions. Other branches of the style are taught along the Dreaming Sea, practiced by the Fifty Virtuous Killers, the Flayed Wisdom Society, and other blademasters.

In Malfeas, Devil-Prince Sword is one of the many killing arts studied within the demon-temple Suntarankal. Supplicants outside its walls can often hear cries of pain and terror from its less successful students, lessons from which some can glean the rudiments of this style. Those seeking greater mastery must pass into Suntarankal and survive its fearful lessons, much to the demon-temple’s delight.
