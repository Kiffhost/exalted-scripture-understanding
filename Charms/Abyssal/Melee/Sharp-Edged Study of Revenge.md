*Those who turn their blades upon the deathknight find her vengeance swift, cruel, and inventive.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal chooses two of the techniques below, which enhance any counterattacks she makes with [[Vengeful Riposte]] or [[Hundred Razor Circle]]. Additional techniques can be purchased for three experience points or one bonus point.
Bitter Violence Caprice: The Abyssal can make the counterattack against an enemy other than her attacker. If she chooses an enemy that her attacker is protecting with a defend other action, he can’t use his [[Defense|Parry]] to protect that character unless he chooses to have his attack miss.
Broken Toys Riposte: The Abyssal can counterattack with a disarm gambit. Mundane weapons are destroyed on a success.
Cruel Severing Steel: Against attacks that beat her [[Defense|Parry]], the Abyssal makes her counterattack before the damage roll. Every two levels of damage she deals forces her attacker to reroll one successful die on the attack roll, starting with 7s and moving up. If this reduces his successes below her [[Defense|Parry]], she counts as having blocked the attack.
[[Mortal]] Folly Deception: The Abyssal can make a distract gambit with her counterattack. The [[Initiative]] cost is halved, rounded down.
Vindictive Blade’s Thirst: Crimson Banquet Hunger’s cost is waived when enhancing the counterattack.
The Abyssal’s player may work with the [[Storyteller]] to create new techniques.
