The Dragon-Blood’s anima spreads to enfold the timbers of her ship, hardening its hull to rebuff the harshest perils of the sea or the weapons of oceangoing pirates. Whenever her ship suffers [[Hull]] damage from a failed roll to navigate an aquatic hazard or from a damage-dealing stratagem such as a broadside in naval combat (Exalted, p. 245), she may roll ([[Essence]] + 2) non-Charm dice. If these successes raise the Dragon-Blood’s total roll high enough to have beaten the hazard’s difficulty or the opposing captain’s roll, the total damage her ship suffers is reduced by one point, although this doesn’t change her failure on the roll. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by succeeding on a [[Sail]] roll with difficulty 4+.
