*The Dragon-Blood and her allies charge across the battlefield like a rapidly spreading flame.*
She makes a mounted rush roll against a significant enemy or battle group out to four range bands away, but no closer than medium range. If not already rolled into battle, all characters [[Join Battle]] immediately. On a success, the Dragon-Blood and all other mounted characters within close range of her (short range for mounted battle groups) move one range band towards the target on each of their next four turns in addition to their normal movement, or until they reach close range. All characters in the charge gain 1 [[Initiative]] for each range band they move while charging the rushed character.
