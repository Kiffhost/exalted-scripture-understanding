Moving too fast for her prey to react, the shadow-stalker claims her due. If the Lunar is concealed from all enemies at the start of a round, she gains (Essence/2, rounded up) [[Initiative]], and takes her turn before any other character. If this Charm’s priority is contested by similar magic, the highest stunt wins. If the Lunar’s [[Initiative]] was already high enough to act before all enemies (after adding this Charm’s bonus) and she makes an unexpected attack on her turn, she adds a free full Excellency. This Charm can only be used once per scene. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with [[Ambush]] Hunter, the Lunar gains ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] instead.
