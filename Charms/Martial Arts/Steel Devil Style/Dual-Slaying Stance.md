Considered the lesser of two forms, Dual Slaying Stance provides an offense that is passive but no less terrifying. While in this stance, the Exalt’s Parry is increased by two, and it cannot fall below two, no matter how many times she’s attacked. In addition, on any turn on which she foregoes an attack, she may react to any attack she attempts to parry with a decisive counterattack that has a base damage equal to her current Charge. This counterattack may be augmented with the Exalt’s Initiative—the Exalt may reflexively devote up to (Essencex2) from her Initiative pool to the damage of each successful counterattack. If she successfully damages a foe with such a strike, she does not return to base Initiative, nor is her Charge affected—only any spent Initiative is lost. Lastly, this form allows the Steel Devil to ignore penalties for attacking with the off-hand. 

## Terrestrial

A Terrestrial may augment counterattacks with up to (Essence) Initiative.
