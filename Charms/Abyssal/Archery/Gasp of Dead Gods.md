*As the deathknight draws back her bowstring, she calls up a swirling maelstrom of wailing phantasms that collapses into a light-eating bolt of entropic [[Essence]].*
The Abyssal makes a decisive attack against an enemy with lower [[Initiative]]. She ignores the limitations of her weapon’s range, and can attack out to long range without needing to aim, or at extreme range with an aim action. The attack has a base damage of (current temporary [[Willpower]]), which doesn’t include the deathknight’s [[Initiative]] or reset it. This is doubled as long as the Abyssal meets one of the following conditions, tripled for two conditions, or quadrupled for three or more:
 - The attack benefits from aiming.
 - The target is crashed.
 - The target has a wound penalty of −2 or higher.
 - The Abyssal is within close range of her target.
 - The target has a Tie of fear that applies to the deathknight.
With a repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a three-mote, three-anima surcharge to add her [[Initiative]] to this Charm’s damage. (It isn’t multiplied). She resets [[Initiative]] on a hit. If she kills her victim, she gains (his [[Essence]] + 3) motes as she drinks in the last of his life’s [[Essence]].
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy whose [[Initiative]] was at least ten points higher than the Abyssal’s.
