*As Brazan Harvest clashes with enemy weapons, it stirs sudden growths of unwanted foliage.*

This Evocation can be used when the wielder successfully parries an attack or when one of her attacks is parried, before the damage roll. It can also be used after a clash attack at close range, regardless of success or failure. The enemy’s weapon becomes overgrown, inflicting a −1 penalty on attack rolls with it and −1 Parry when blocking with it. Any Initiative costs for using weapon tags also increase by one. The penalty on attack rolls and Initiative costs stack, up to a maximum of 3.

Once a weapon’s penalty increases to −3, a subsequent use of this Evocation automatically disarms it. For the rest of the scene, characters with Intimacies of greed perceive it as being incredibly valuable, regardless of its true worth, The weapon’s wielder can clear overgrowth with a miscellaneous action, negating a single use of this Evocation. It can’t affect unarmed attacks and natural weapons.
