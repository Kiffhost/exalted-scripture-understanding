*The Sidereal uses her understanding of the Wyld’s chaotic energies and the Underworld’s deathly stillness to corrupt the pattern of an enemy’s fate.*
The Sidereal rolls a withering or decisive ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) attack against an enemy within medium range with this baleful energy. A withering attack uses the [[Accuracy]] of an artifact [[Archery]] weapon (Close −1; Short +5; Medium +3; Long +1; Extreme −1). It ignores armored soak, with ([[Intelligence]] + 3 + extra successes) raw damage and Overwhelming ([[Essence]] + 1). Decisive attacks ignore [[Hardness]] from armor. She can enhance this attack with [[Archery]] [[Charms]], [[Thrown]] [[Charms]], or [[Martial Arts]] [[Charms]] that are compatible with any ranged weapons, but can’t combine [[Charms]] from multiple such Abilities unless they’re explicitly compatible with other Abilities. Enemies who’re immune to exposure to the Wyld, like a Solar using [[Integrity]]-Protecting Prana (Exalted, p. 303), are also protected from this attack, receiving +5 soak and [[Hardness]] 5 against it. The undead likewise receive this benefit.
