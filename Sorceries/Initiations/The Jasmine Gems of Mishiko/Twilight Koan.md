Mishiko appears every dawn and dusk to pose a seemingly nonsensical question to the sorcerer. The sorcerer’s player can stunt an action with a description of her realizing an answer to this koan, gaining (higher of Intelligence or Lore) sorcerous motes which last until the scene ends. Once she’s done so, she must wait until the next sunrise or sunset for Mishiko to pose a new koan before doing so again.
