The Evocation for which this armor got its name, [[Dauntless]] floods the Solar with purpose and removes any obstacles to delivering the finishing blow. This Evocation allows the wearer to ignore all wound and illness penalties on one attack against a crashed opponent. If she brings that opponent down to his Incapacitated health level or lower withthisattack,shegainsonetemporarypointofWillpower. This Evocation may be used once per day, but may be reset by surviving a 15+ dice decisive damage roll.
