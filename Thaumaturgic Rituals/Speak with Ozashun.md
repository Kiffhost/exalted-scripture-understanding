There is a stream running through the mountains ten miles west of Medo’s capital. The Frozen Spring pass overlooks a section of this stream, where it runs into an open-mouth cave in the side of the mountain. This is the place where Ozashun may be called, during the night of the new moon, by thrusting a burning branch into the muddy shore opposite the cave and speaking the name of a child who trusts you. The darkness intensifies and drinks what little starlight makes it down through the towering pines, giving the impression of a wrinkled, ancient face, gape-mouthed, toothless. From its mouth comes a shadow on the water, four-legged, a predator like a fox or a wolf. Ozashun knows all the secrets of the mountain and the stream running through it, but only back through the last new moon. For every question it answers, it gains the power to enter a child’s dream, to speak with and influence them. Perhaps it is a coincidence that the mountains and especially the area around the Frozen Pass are thick with child ghosts. 

[[Speak with Ozashun]] is extremely rare, though it has been recorded more than once as a gift among the hill tribes of Medo.
