*The Abyssal always recognizes the scent of her prey.*
When the Abyssal makes an Awareness roll against a living character, she adds successes equal to his wound penalty. If she succeeds on a roll opposing a living enemy’s Stealth in combat, she gains one Initiative as her hunger mounts.
## Special activation rules
This Charm’s duration can be extended as per the Awareness Excellency.
