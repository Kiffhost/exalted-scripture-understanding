*None dare disobey the Infernal warlord’s commands.*

The Infernal adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on a command action and rerolls 6s until they cease to appear. If she rerolls at least three 6s, she gains two Initiative.
## [[Keys]]
#### Green Sun General (War 3) (+2m)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote surcharge to reroll 5s. They don’t count toward triggering the Initiative bonus.
#### Universe-Conquering Tyrant Command (War 5, Essence 3, [[#Green Sun General (War 3) (+2m)|Green Sun General]]) (+1m, 3i)
The Infernal can pay a one-mote, three-Initiative surcharge to add an additional non-Charm success for each die that’s rerolled into a success. If she rerolls at least three 6s, she adds an additional non-Charm success.
