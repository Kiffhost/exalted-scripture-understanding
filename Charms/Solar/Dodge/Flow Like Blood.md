The Exalt permeates her being with [[Essence]], becoming partly atomized. For the rest of the scene, when dodging attacks by opponents with lower [[Initiative]] than her own, the Lawgiver ignores all penalties to her Evasion. Attacks which miss her often seem to pass harmlessly through her dreamlike form. While this Charm is active, [[Reed in the Wind]] costs only one [[Initiative]] per Evasion, and each round that the Solar remains within close range of an enemy without being struck by an attack—either due to her Evasion, or due to not being attacked—she gains a point of [[Initiative]].
