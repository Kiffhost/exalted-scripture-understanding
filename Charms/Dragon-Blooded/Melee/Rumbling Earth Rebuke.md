*The stalwart force of the Dragon-Blood’s defense is like a seismic shockwave as her attacker’s blades rebound off her weapon.*
After successfully blocking or clashing an attack made from close range, she may activate this Charm to reflexively attempt a disarm gambit against her attacker.
In Earth Aura, a successful gambit inflicts an additional point of onslaught penalty, and destroys mundane weapons rather than disarming them.
