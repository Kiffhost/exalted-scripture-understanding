The Solar leaps in and out of battle with nigh untraceable speed. The Exalt may use her (Dexterity + Stealth) to Join Battle. Her Join Battle result also acts as an attempt to enter Stealth. If she beats her opponentâ€™s Awareness-based Join Battle roll, she is automatically concealed, so long as there is a viable place to hide. If her foe uses a Join Battle roll modified to use any other Ability than Awareness, then he must make an Awareness roll to spot her, suffering a penalty equal to the difference in their Initiative, even if he rolled higher. If he fails the Awareness check, the Solar still vanishes from view.
