*A thousand dead languages echo through the Underworld, a wellspring of understanding beyond knowledge.*
The Abyssal can understand speech in a foreign language, hearing the words’ meaning in an inhuman, rasping voice rather than the speaker’s own. Each use of this Charm lets her understand a few simple sentences or one complex one.
With a [[Linguistics]] 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm to speak an unknown language with an eerie voice that isn’t her own. Each use lets her communicate a few short, simple sentences. However, she can’t communicate abstract or highly complex statements, and any influence rolls she makes with this still face the usual impediments for lacking a shared language.
