*As the Sidereal presses a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of Absence against her chest, it sinks into her flesh in a flash of green light to encircle her heart, wresting her from her life to take refuge in a new one.*
The Sidereal vanishes, reappearing in a location chosen by the Storyteller where she can start a new life in a way that will advance the chronicle’s story. Her player creates a new identity appropriate to this locale; this can be a mortal, an Exalt, a spirit, or another supernatural creature, though she can’t imitate specific characters.
The Sidereal rolls (Manipulation + Stealth) to determine her cover identity’s social context, choosing Story Merits whose total rating equals her successes. The Sidereal’s player and Storyteller should work together to determine what exactly these Merits represent. With four-dot Backing and fivedot Command, she could be a prominent general in a warrior-queen’s army; with three-dot Cult and five-dot Followers, she could be the patron god of a city-state’s beggars.
- Those who reside in the chosen location or otherwise have reason to interact with the Sidereal’s cover identity remember her having always been there and gain appropriate Intimacies. The specifics of the relationship a character remembers having with the Sidereal’s cover identity should be determined between that character’s player and the Sidereal’s. If a nontrivial character discovers evidence his memories have been altered, he may pay three Willpower to reject the false memories.
- She takes on the physical appearance of her cover identity, and any overt magic she uses takes on a suitable appearance. This includes her anima banner; it won’t rise above dim in un-Exalted cover identities. Seeing through this disguise is impossible without magic like Eye of the Unconquered Sun (Exalted, p. 273). Divination, scrying, and similar magic won’t provide information that contradicts her cover identity.
- Characters automatically fail rolls against the Sidereal’s Guile that could contradict her cover identity unless they use magic or have a Tie to the Sidereal’s true identity; even then, they suffer +2 target number.
- Her cover identity takes the place of a resplendent destiny, suppressing her arcane fate but preventing her from donning other destinies — unless her cover identity’s also a Sidereal. This cover can’t be compromised like normal resplendent destinies can.
- If she disguises herself as a supernatural being, she can learn Eclipse Charms appropriate to its nature. She retains them even after this Charm ends, though she must wear a resplendent destiny of that type of being in order to use them.
- All Psyche effects, Shaping effects, sorcerous curses, and other harmful ongoing magic she suffers from at the time she uses this Charm are suppressed for its duration.
- If she knows Self-Annihilating Discretion, she may use it for free with this Charm to erase memories as appropriate to her new cover identity, without needing a roll. These changes revert when this Charm ends.
- If she knows Death-of-Self Meditation (p. 309), she may exchange any number of her Intimacies for new Intimacies of equal intensity appropriate to her cover identity. These remain even after this Charm ends.
Once this Charm ends, the cover identity begins to unravel. The disguise itself ends immediately; memories of the cover identity fade away with each passing hour, gone entirely in a matter of days. The Sidereal loses access to Merits as the relevant character’s memories fade, though she may be able to retain some through ingenuity.
