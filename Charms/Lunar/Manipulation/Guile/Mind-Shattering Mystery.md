*Drawing back her mask, the Lunar reveals horrors beyond imagination.*
After successfully asserting [[Guile]] against a read intentions roll, the Lunar makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + {Presence or Socialize}) instill roll with ([[Essence]]) bonus dice against the opposing character. Success inflicts the Madness [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 168) at Minor intensity, or strengthens an !!existingMinorDerangementtoMajor.IftheLunarsucceeds!! with at least (victimâ€™s [[Integrity]]) extra successes, she may instead inflict Madness at Major intensity, or strengthen a Major [[Derangement]] to Defining. Her victim must immediately make a [[Willpower]] roll against that [[Derangement]], with 1s subtracting successes. If the Lunar enhanced her [[Guile]] with [[Will-Drowning Void]], using this Charm against that read intentions roll costs only one mote and one [[Willpower]]. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar uses this Charm in a shape the opposing character has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward, the dice added to her influence roll are non-Charm.
