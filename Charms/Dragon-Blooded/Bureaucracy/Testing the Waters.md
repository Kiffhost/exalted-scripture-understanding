A slick political dealer, the Dragon-Blood understands the motives of officials better than they do themselves. This Charm functions identically to its prerequisite, except that a successful read intentions reveals how the target plans to vote on an upcoming issue before a governmental, bureaucratic, or mercantile organization. It also reveals the strongest [[Intimacy]] motiving that character’s vote, if any. A [[Bureaucracy]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase of this Charm lets the Dragon-Blood pay an additional point of [[Willpower]] once per scene to apply her read intentions roll against the [[Guile]] of all voting characters she can perceive. She doesn’t learn [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] for each individual voter whose [[Guile]] is beaten, but is able to discern the major factions within the group and which one each character whose [[Guile]] she beat belongs to, as well as an [[Intimacy]] driving each faction’s agenda.
