*The Abyssal’s words shatter bonds of love and poison the faith of saints.*
When the Abyssal makes an [[instill]] or [[persuade]] roll, any [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] her targets use to bolster their [[Resolve]] count as one step lower to determine their bonus. This doesn’t affect [[Intimacy|Tie]]s of fear towards her, negative [[Intimacy|Tie]]s to the living, or [[Intimacy|Principle]]s that reflect a positive outlook on death.
