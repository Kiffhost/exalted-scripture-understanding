*The Solar ascends to the Second Circle and becomes an avatar bearing aspects of Heaven and Hell in her mind.*
In all the world, there are only a handful of sorcerers at this level of power. Upon learning this Charm, the Exalt gains the ability to cast spells from the Celestial Circle of [[sorcery]]. In addition, the Solar learns one shaping ritual and one Celestial spell for free. The spell selected acts as an additional control. [[Charms/Solar/Occult/Celestial Circle Sorcery]] may not be learned prior to [[Essence]] 3 by selecting [[Occult]] as a Supernal Ability.
