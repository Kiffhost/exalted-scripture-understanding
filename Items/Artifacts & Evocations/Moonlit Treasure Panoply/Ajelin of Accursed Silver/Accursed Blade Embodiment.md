*Calling upon Ajelin’s cursed power, its wielder draws strength from hatred.*
The wielder gains the following benefits:
 - Ajelin gains +1 [[Accuracy]].
 - Her attacks ignore (Enmity) soak and [[Hardness]].
 - She adds (Enmity) dice of damage on decisive attacks against crashed enemies.
 - Her Enmity’s [[Resolve]] bonus increases by one.
Once the wielder has used this Evocation, she can’t voluntarily weaken [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that could qualify as her Enmity for the rest of the session, nor can she attempt to end her attunement to Ajelin.
## Resonant
With [[Essence]] 3, the wielder can use this Evocation reflexively when she wins [[Join Battle]]. If her Enmity is a Defining [[Intimacy]], she waives the Evocation’s [[Willpower]] cost.
