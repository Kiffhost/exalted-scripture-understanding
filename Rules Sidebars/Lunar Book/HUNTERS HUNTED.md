When a Lunar claims a fellow Lunarâ€™s shape by killing him, she claims all his human and animal shapes. If she uses a Charm to claim his shape without killing him, she only takes his current shape at the time she concludes the hunt. She can likewise claim shapes from other shapeshifters capable of taking on human or animal shapes, like powerful Moon-Touched (p. XX).
