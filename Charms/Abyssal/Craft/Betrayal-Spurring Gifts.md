*The gifts and treasures that fall from the hands of Death’s Lawgiver are fetters for those who claim them, subjugating them to her dark will.*
The Abyssal may use social influence to leverage gifts she’s made for others as though they were Ties of gratitude to her. Gifts created with basic or major projects count as Minor Ties; those made with superior projects count as Major Ties; those made with legendary projects count as Defining Ties. The gift need not be on a target’s person, so long as he remains in possession of it.
Additionally, while using this Charm, the Abyssal waives the mote costs of [[Drawn to Death’s Beauty]], [[Five-Fold Malice Curse]], [[Magnificent Cenotaph Allure]], and [[Soul-Tarnishing Treasures]], including uses that are already active. Once this Charm ends, she must commit those Charms’ mote costs as usual to maintain them.
