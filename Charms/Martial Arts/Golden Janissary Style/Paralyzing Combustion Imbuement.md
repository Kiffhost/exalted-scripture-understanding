*The deepest darkness yields before the smallest flame.*
The stylist makes a decisive attack. Damaging her foe causes bursts of fiery, golden light to erupt from within his body with the sound of ringing bells. This penalizes his Stealth as a glowing anima banner (p. 154) and increases his wound penalty by âˆ’1. If this raises his wound penalty above his Stamina, he cannot disengage from close range with the martial artist for as long as he remains illumined. 
Creatures of darkness are burned by this light, suffering (Essence) dice of aggravated damage each turn, ignoring Hardness. This light shines until the scene ends, or until the victim crashes or incapacitates the stylist. 
## Mastery
An enemy whose wound penalty is raised above his Stamina must disengage to move away from the martial artist regardless of the distance between them. 
## Terrestrial
An illumined enemy may free himself of the effect by landing a decisive attack against the stylist.
