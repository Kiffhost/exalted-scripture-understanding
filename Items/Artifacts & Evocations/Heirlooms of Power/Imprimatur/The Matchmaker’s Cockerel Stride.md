The wielder may flurry a supplemented full defense with a disengage roll, and it grants her an additional +1 Parry, which counts as a bonus from Charms. Until her next turn, she gains one Renown whenever she successfully parries an attack. 

## Resonant

If the wielder flurries a full defense and a disengage and succeeds on the disengage roll, neither action costs Initiative.
