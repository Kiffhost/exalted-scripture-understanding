*The stylistâ€™s footwork is faster than her enemies can follow, outmaneuvering their attacks and striking with deadly speed.* 
She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on a movement action. If successful, she gains +1 Evasion until her next turn. 
If the reflexive movement granted by an enhanced rush brings the stylist within close range of the rushed enemy, any attacks she makes against him on her next turn add one die on the attack roll.
