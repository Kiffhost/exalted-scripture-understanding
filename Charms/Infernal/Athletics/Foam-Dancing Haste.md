*The Infernal is above wallowing in gore, darting over rivers of blood without sinking into them.*

As long as the Infernal moves at full speed without stopping, she can run over liquid surfaces and similarly unstable surfaces as though they were solid. She isn’t affected by environmental hazards whose surface she runs over. This Charm ends if she stops moving.
## [[Keys]]
#### Gravity-Rebuking Grace (Athletics 4) (+3m)
For a three-mote surcharge, the Infernal can also run up or down sheer vertical surfaces like walls or move upside down on horizontal surfaces like ceilings. If this Charm ends while she’s somewhere she couldn’t normally stand, she falls unless she renews it on her next turn.
#### Running to Forever (Athletics 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal permanently gains the ability to move across liquid surfaces. She must still use this Charm to gain protection against environmental hazards. If she has [[#Gravity-Rebuking Grace (Athletics 4) (+3m)|Gravity-Rebuking Grace]], she permanently gains the ability to move down vertical surfaces or upside down on horizontal ones, but must still use this Charm to move up surfaces. If she stops moving, she loses this key’s benefit until after she’s spent at least one round moving at full speed.
