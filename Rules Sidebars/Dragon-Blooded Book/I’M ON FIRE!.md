I’M ON FIRE! Several Dragon-Blooded Charms, as well as other effects, set an enemy ablaze until he extinguishes himself. A character might do this by dousing himself with a bucket of water, smothering the fire by covering it with earth, or similar methods. This is typically a miscellaneous action (Exalted, p. 196), but not always — plunging into a lake only requires a reflexive move action.
