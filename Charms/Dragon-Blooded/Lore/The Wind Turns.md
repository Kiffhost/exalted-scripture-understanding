A breath sent out into the world may return as a hurricane, and Essence is the breath of the world. The Dragon-Blood rolls (Willpower + Initiative). She and any of her Hearthmates within short range gain one mote for every two successes. Using this Charm resets her to base Initiative. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Tie towards another Dragon-Blood, or to the Dragon-Blooded host as a whole.
