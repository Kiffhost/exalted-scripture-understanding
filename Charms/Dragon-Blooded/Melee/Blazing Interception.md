The Dragon-Blood’s battle spirit flares as she fends off peril to her ward, driving her forward in a fiery counterstrike. After successfully parrying an attack against a character she’s protecting with a defend other action, she may respond with a decisive counterattack. In Fire Aura, the Dragon-Blood’s ward may attempt a reflexive distract gambit (Exalted, p. 200) against his attacker to benefit the Exalt before she makes her counterattack. This doesn’t count as her ward’s attack for the round.
