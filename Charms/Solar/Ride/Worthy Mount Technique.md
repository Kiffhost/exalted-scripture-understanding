The Solar is one with her mount. Through her skill and the bond they share, the mount can take reflexive defend other actions to defend the Solar, paying one from its [[Initiative]] to prevent attacks which would harm her. These defend other actions increase the mount’s Parry and Evasion by 1, but cannot raise them past 5. In addition, while it is in a position to guard the Solar, its damage totals gain a number of dice equal to the Solar’s [[Essence]].
