Thorns grow to wreathe the shaft of the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s arrow in flight. On a withering attack, she adds +1 Overwhelming, or (Essence) Overwhelming if the attack benefits from aiming. Decisive attacks add (Essence/2, rounded up) threshold successes on the attack roll as dice of damage, or (Essence) threshold successes if she aimed.
