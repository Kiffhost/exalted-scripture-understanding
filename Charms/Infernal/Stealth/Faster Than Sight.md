*The Infernal’s movement is felt, not seen, her speed flickering into seeming invisibility.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- She can roll to enter concealment without needing a hiding place as long as she moves at least one range band on the turn she does so.
- Her nigh-invisible speed imposes a −2 penalty on vision-based rolls opposing her Stealth.
- When she rolls Stealth to move between range bands while concealed, she ignores the additional penalty for crossing through wide-open terrain.

This Charm ends if a round goes by without the Infernal moving at least one range band or successfully rushing an enemy. Outside of combat, she must run continuously at full speed to sustain its duration. If she’s used this Charm to enter concealment without any obstruction to hide behind, that concealment is broken if this Charm ends.

With Stealth 5, the Infernal can take rush actions while in concealment.
