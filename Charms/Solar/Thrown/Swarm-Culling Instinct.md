The Lawgiver answers the call of battle with a swarm of deadly steel. This Charm supplements a Join Battle roll, allowing the Solar to reroll a number of non-successes equal to the number of 10s in her result. 10s occurring in rerolled dice spark additional rerolls. In addition, if the Solar wins Join Battle, she may attack (Dexterity) opponents, rolling each attack separately so that she may alternate effectively between withering and decisive attacks. Swarm-Culling Instinct is expressly permitted to be used in combination with Charms that boost Join Battle results, so long as they are not based in Archery, Melee, or Brawl.
