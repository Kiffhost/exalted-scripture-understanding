*Wrapping a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Dancer around her eyes, the Sidereal embodies the affirmations and truths that those around her have waited their entire lives to hear, a measured antidote to all the troubles of their lives.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits
- She gains a bonus dot of Appearance, which can raise her above Appearance 5.
- When she rolls to instill positive Ties, weaken negative Ties, or inspire positive emotions, the Willpower cost to resist is increased by one. This also applies to persuade rolls that leverage positive Ties or emotion.
Mortals and trivial characters are automatically affected and can’t resist with Willpower unless the influence opposes a Defining Tie.
- Once per scene, she may waive the Performance Excellency’s cost to reduce the target number of one of the above influence rolls.
- Anyone who openly and attentively listens to her speak or watches her perform gains a Major Tie of romantic love to her. The Tie is one of fascination for characters of incompatible orientation or those whose players invoke the Red Rule. A character can resist for three Willpower, separate from the cost of any influence she employs, rendering him immune for the rest of the session. Nontrivial characters may avoid this by deliberately ignoring her or tuning her out — asserting Resolve against an influence roll (even if unsuccessfully), leaving halfway through a performance, not paying attention in conversation, etc.
- Attack rolls against the Sidereal and rolls for other harmful actions against her suffer a −3 penalty if the opposing character has previously heard her speak during this Charm’s duration. The same is true for disengage rolls and other rolls to move away from her.
The Sidereal is blinded by the prayer strip, suffering a −3 penalty on vision-based rolls. She can’t remove it without ending this Charm.
