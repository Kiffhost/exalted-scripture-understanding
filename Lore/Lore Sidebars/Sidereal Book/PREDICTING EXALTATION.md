Predicting Exaltation is all but impossible. Doing so requires foretelling the choices of the Exalted’s patrons, whose reclusive nature and supreme power can thwart even the mightiest Exalted’s efforts. Nor is it any easier to predict when or if the blood of the Dragons will awaken. Magic can still reveal information useful for predicting an Exaltation — e.g., Of Truths Best Unspoken can reveal that a Solar’s appearance will have a historic impact at a certain time and place.
Sidereal Exaltation is an exception. Sidereals are chosen at the moment of their birth but Exalt later in life. There’s no specific Charm for identifying Sidereals-to-be, but clever use of magic can do so.
