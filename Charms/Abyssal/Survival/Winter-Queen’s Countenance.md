*Where the Abyssal walks, winter follows like a train of lace and frost.*
The Abyssal can pay a five-mote, four-[[Initiative]] surcharge when she uses [[Blood-Chilling Caress]] to manifest an aura of killing cold. This is an [[Environmental Hazards|environmental hazard]] that extends out to short range from her, with difficulty ([[Wits]] + 1) and Damage ([[Essence]], maximum 5)L/round. Enemies damaged by it suffer a −1 environmental penalty on [[Dexterity]] rolls from the cold until the end of their next turn.
This aura freezes water and extinguishes mundane flames. Such is its chill that Blood-Chilling Caress’ protection now extends to hazards based on fire or heat, as well as cold-based hazards.
