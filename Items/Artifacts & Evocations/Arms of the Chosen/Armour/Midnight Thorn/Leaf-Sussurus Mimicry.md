*Midnight Thorn’s armored links become as silent and soft as leaves.*
This Evocation enhances a [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] roll made while in plant-based concealment, lowering any penalties by the wearer’s ([[Essence]]). 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wearer isn’t dissonant with jade, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she successfully ambushes a non-trivial enemy. 

## Resonant

As long as the wearer’s roll beats at least one non-trivial enemy, she gains a point of [[Initiative]].
