*The Abyssal unleashes a psychic howl to shatter minds, a terrible keening that gives voice to the Neverborn’s mad wrath against the gods who betrayed them and the kin who abandoned them.*
The Abyssal rolls a single decisive attack with ([[Charisma]] + [[Occult]]) against all enemies within long range, adding (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Whispers]]) automatic successes. This attack is [[UNBLOCKABLE, UNDODGEABLE|unblockable]] and [[UNBLOCKABLE, UNDODGEABLE|undodgeable]], but is resisted by targets’ [[Resolve]]. This ignores all [[cover]] and can affect dematerialized enemies.
The attack has a base damage of ([[Essence]] + [[Whispers]]) against each hit enemy, and the Abyssal divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among them, rounded up. Damaged characters suffer the effects of [[Soul-Warping Whispers]]. Trivial characters don’t count toward the [[Initiative]] division — they either die on the spot, collapse in writhing agony, or flee, at the Abyssal’s choice.
This psychic onslaught can’t be perceived by those who aren’t targeted by it, as with [[Screaming in Silence]].
