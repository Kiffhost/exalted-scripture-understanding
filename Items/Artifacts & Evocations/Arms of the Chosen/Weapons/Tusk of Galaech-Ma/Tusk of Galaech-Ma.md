Wherever campfires crackle in the far North to keep away killing winds and desolate howls, the tale of Galaech-Ma and the Snow Hunter is told. The Snow Hunter was once a man, until looming death on six massive furred legs emerged from the darkness and devoured his village. Galaech-Ma, a monster out of nightmare, had come. The sole survivor swore on the blood of his kin that he would take the behemoth down or die trying. Becoming the Snow Hunter, for ten years he pursued the monster through blizzard and bordermarch. On the day he finally found it, Luna graced him with power to avenge his people at last. Gifted with new life, the Snow Hunter forged GalaechMa’s mighty tusk into the head of a ruthless lance, plating it with moonsilver and cooling it in the beast’s blood. The moonsilver haft is built around one of the monster’s bones and ringed with braided grips woven from its coarse white fur. In the Snow Hunter’s hands, the Tusk claimed the lives of countless beasts from beyond Creation’s edge and woke powers devoted to felling giants, piercing thick hides, and hunting down monstrosities. Over centuries, the Snow Hunter’s obsession with ridding Creation of unnatural beasts infused the weapon with an uncompromising refusal to quit. Today the direlance sits idle, a mere heirloom of a forgotten tribe amid remote Northern wastes, handed down to a holy man or woman each generation. For centuries, none have had the power to wield it. 
 
## Evocations of the Tusk

of Galaech-Ma The Tusk exults in the chase, its bloodlust stirred by the thrill of the hunt. The wielder may choose an enemy as the Tusk’s quarry after a successful roll to: • Follow that enemy’s tracks (Exalted, p. 230); • Lure him out of a place of safety; • Catch him in a trap, literal or figurative. The Tusk gains +1 Accuracy and +1 Overwhelming against its quarry. It can have only one quarry at a time.
