This fragile-looking construct of magical material, feathersteel, and Essence has a wingspan of 20 feet. It appears to be an exceptionally slender and delicate glider frame that lacks a cloth covering. It weighs less than half as much as a conventional folding glider, and folds small enough that the user can wear it underneath a cloak. When the user spends one mote of Essence, the glider automatically unfolds and the framework is covered with a faintly glowing fabric of solidified Essence. The glider remains active for one full scene, and the user can easily extend this duration by spending one additional mote per scene.

Because the glider is so responsive, it adds four dice to the (Dexterity + Athletics) roll necessary to control it. It can can soar on thermals and also multiplies the distance the user can jump horizontally by five (if the user has room to unfold its wings – this bonus is added to other bonuses gained from Charms or Anima powers)— this usually amounts to a gliding distance of four range bands, at a rate of one band per round, though launching from great heights can dramatically expand this range. For long distance travel, an Essence glider has a speed of 50 mph. The user must commit two motes to use this artifact.
