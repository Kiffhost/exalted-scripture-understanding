The Sidereal’s inner eye witnesses every act of violence she has yet to inflict, immersing her in the boundless sea of blood she must shed to survive. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  Her withering attacks gain +1 Overwhelming. This increases to +(Strength/2, rounded up) for unarmed attacks. 
-  Her decisive damage rolls and grapple control rolls gain −1 target number against enemies of fate and crashed enemies. 
-  She adds (Strength/2, rounded up) soak. If she’s unarmored, this increases to ([[Strength]]). 
-  She adds +1 to the [[Resolve]] bonus of Intimacies that support engaging in battle, making sacrifices, or disregard the desires of others. 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal can enter this Form reflexively when she takes decisive damage or Joins Battle while at a −2 or worse wound penalty.
