Skilled in the ways of seafaring deception, the Dragon-Blood conceals the true colors of her ship under a mirage of Essence, causing other vessels to perceive it as a ship of their own allegiance or purpose. A merchant vessel from a foreign kingdom would see her warship as flying under its own kingdom’s flag, while a pirate raiding-ship would see her as a fellow corsair. She rolls (Manipulation + Sail) to determine the quality of this ruse, adding (Essence) non-Charm bonus dice. Any nontrivial character within long range or closer of the ship can attempt to see through this ruse with a (Perception + [Awareness or Investigation]) roll with a difficulty equal to the Dragon-Blood’s result on the roll. Characters who attempt this roll without the benefit of applicable magic or superhuman senses suffer a −3 penalty on the roll. Once a character has boarded the ship, he can see through this ruse automatically. Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood may use this Charm on herself whenever she attempts to fit in to a society of sailors or other seafarers: a ring of smugglers operating out of Champoor, a Tya guildhouse, the Lintha crime family, etc. She adds (Sail) bonus dice on any disguise roll she makes to pose as a member of that group, and gains +2 Guile against any roll that would reveal information exposing her outsider status.
