*The wretched clangour of lies rouses the Infernal’s righteousness, infinitely worse than her wrath.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after successfully asserting her Resolve against a Manipulation-based influence roll or any other influence that involves deception. She makes a special (Charisma + Integrity) instill roll against him, doubling 9s and adding non-Charm successes equal to the number of successes he failed by. If she succeeds, he’s made to believe his own lie. If his memories conflict with this, he’ll assume he misremembered.

Resisting this Charm costs the same amount of Willpower as the influence used by the opposing character, or (Infernal’s Essence) if that’s higher. If it required entering a Decision Point, the affected character must do so as well. However, he can only resist with Willpower if he encounters external evidence of the lie’s falsity.
