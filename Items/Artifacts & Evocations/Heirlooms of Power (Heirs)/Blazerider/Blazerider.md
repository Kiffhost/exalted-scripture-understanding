Forgotten wonders of the First Age, windblades are personal-scale flying transports. Each is a narrow, aerodynamic platform about a yard across, wrought from magical materials and sorcerous constructs of solidified Essence. The art of creating new windblades is lost to the Second Age’s artificers; the few that remain, scattered across Creation, are prized by Chosen, scavenger princes, and savants.
The Solar Indeshi Twice-Anointed forged Blazerider for his champion and confidante Lacquer Gannet, to aid the Dragon-Blood in her siege of Frozen Star Parapet. Gannet scaled the Parapet’s glacial fortifications atop Blazerider, then wielded it as a burning blade against the Children of the Frozen Star, breaking their infectious dominion.
In the Shogunate, Gannet’s great-granddaughter Perehun flew atop Blazerider in pursuit of the fabled Siramarg That Opens The Way — and though she never captured the elusive bird-spirit, her battles against the bandits and raiders who assailed her along her hunt helped pave the way for the Mountainbreaker Legion’s pacification of the Blue Glass Uplands.
When Bagrash Köl’s empire threatened to expand across the borders of Grand Cherak, Ferem Cinel was among those Cheraki Dragon-Blooded who rode against the sorcerer-emperor in the ill-fated Six Dove Siege, flying Blazerider through the doors that opened to permit the sun and moon to pass through Köl’s vast towers. Cinel ultimately fell to one of the incomparable horrors created by the Eye of Autochthon, but the lone survivor of the Siege bore it back to House Ferem.
Blazerider’s red jade exterior is engraved with ornate arabesque designs resembling countless tongues of dancing flame, twisting to encircle the windblade’s hearthstone slot. When wielded as a weapon via Flying Dragon Fang, it’s thrown like a skycutter, albeit longer and less curved.
