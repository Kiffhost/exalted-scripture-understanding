The Dragon-Blood has mastered fundamental principles of language, allowing her to converse with anyone from the conquered princes of the Realm’s dominion to the most savage barbarians beyond its borders. She may pay an additional five motes and one Willpower when she uses Language-Learning Ritual to waive the need for prior study and extend its effect to all languages she’s ever encountered, rather than a single language, developing fluency without needing any prior study.
