*Blood and fear grease the wheels of bureaucracy, leading inexorably toward the truth.*
The Abyssal begins an investigation into an organization by making a demonstration out of one of its members, publicly punishing him for some offense, real or fabricated. She doesn’t need any authority within an organization to investigate it so long as the group’s leadership approves her punishment — either in advance or by giving it their imprimatur after the fact.
The Abyssal adds five automatic successes on Investigation and Socialize rolls made in the course of the investigation. When she deals with organization members while pursing the investigation, their fear encourages honesty. This counts as a Minor Tie of obedient fear toward her. If their Resolve (including modifiers from Intimacies) is lower than the Abyssal’s (Charisma or Manipulation), this counts as a Major Tie instead.
This terror is all the greater if the Abyssal initiates her investigation with a fatal punishment. The Tie is imposed in all interactions, not just those related to the investigation, and organization members suffer −2 Resolve when determining its intensity.
