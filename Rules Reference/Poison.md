# TLDR
[[Poison]] lasts its [[#Duration]] - <successes on (Stamina+Resistance) roll>, applying its [[#Penalty]] and dealing its [[#Damage]] every [[#Interval]]. Poisoning with an envenomed weapon requires a [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack]].
# Full text
Whether it is a serpent’s venom, an assassin’s weapon, or the distilled malevolence of a Demon Prince, there are ten thousand poisons to be found throughout the world of Creation. Mighty as the Exalted may be, even they can be laid low by such means. 

In Exalted, a poison is treated as a debilitating status effect that deals damage to a character over an extended period of time. Each poison has five main statistics: [[#Damage]], [[#Interval]], [[#Duration]], [[#Penalty]], and [[#Vector]].

When a character is first exposed to a poison they roll ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). Each success rolled subtracts one unit (rounds, minutes, etc.) from the [[#duration]] of the poison. The Exalted and other supernatural beings can reduce the duration of a poison down to zero; mortals can, at best, reduce the duration to half its base value, rounded up.

<details><summary>Example:</summary> While wandering in the warped forests of the Eastern Wyld, Illustrious Aya finds herself ambushed by a raksha who wields a flail of biting coral snakes. As he attacks her, she is exposed to snake venom, and reflexively rolls ([[Resistance]] + [[Stamina]]) to reduce its duration. She only rolls two successes, for a total duration of one round. On that round, the Storyteller rolls two dice, and deals one point of [[Initiative]] damage to Aya for each success rolled.</details>

# Damage
The amount of damage that the poison deals at each [[#interval]] of its [[#duration]]. May be listed as dice to be rolled (typical for [[Health Track]] or [[Initiative]] damage) or levels to apply directly.

Characters cannot naturally heal the damage dealt by a poison while that poison’s [[#duration]] is still in effect. 

Despite the name of this trait, some poisons may not damage the victim’s [[Initiative]] or health track directly, instead draining [[Willpower]], [[Essence]], or some other resource—but these are generally the exception. Such non-standard damage is not rolled, but subtracted directly instead.
# Interval
The time between instances of [[#damage]] over the poison's [[#duration]].

Note that most poisons that have an interval short enough to recur multiple times throughout a combat deal [[Initiative]] damage, rather than [[Health Track#Bashing|bashing]] or [[Health Track#Lethal|lethal]] damage. **In combat, poison damage is rolled at the end of a round, after all characters have acted**. 

While a character is in [[Initiative#Crash]], [[Initiative]] poisons instead apply their damage directly to the character’s [[Health Track]]—usually as lethal damage, although some poisons may deal bashing damage, as noted in their description. 
# Duration
The base (usually worst-case) length of time that the poison lasts. 

When characters roll ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) to resist a poison, their rolled successes will be subtracted from this value to determine the actual time the poison lasts. 
## Multiple doses
Multiple doses of the same poison stack their durations— if a character is already suffering from arsenic poisoning, consuming a new dose will simply add to the length of the preexisting condition. 
# Penalty
A penalty that is applied to all actions the character takes while poisoned (within the [[#Duration]])
# Vector
The usual means by which the poison is contracted. 

Common vectors include damage (for weapons that can be applied to poison), touch, inhalation, and ingestion. Poisoning someone with an envenomed weapon requires a successful [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack]].
