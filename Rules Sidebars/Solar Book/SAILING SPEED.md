So how fast does a ship travel, when going from place to place? As a general rule of thumb, a shipâ€™s cruising speed is twice its [[Ship Speed]] bonus in miles per hour. Thus, a trireme moving under sail (Speed +2) along a trade current (Speed +1) with oars stowed (Speed +0), moving at Speed 3 total, will travel from isle to isle at about 6 miles per hour.
