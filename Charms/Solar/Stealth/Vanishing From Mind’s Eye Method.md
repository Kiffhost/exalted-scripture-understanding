One of the greatest of all deceptions—the Solar vanishes from memory. Roll the Exalt’s ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) and add her [[Essence]] in automatic successes to the result. Record the result. The Exalt slips out of the thoughts and memories of everyone who has ever known her, hiding in their minds. Upon meeting, she is unrecognizable to those who should know her. Once per day, individuals affected by this Charm may attempt to recognize the Exalt or remember her involvement in a past event. Roll the subject’s ([[Wits]] + [[Lore]]) against a difficulty equal to the Exalt’s result. If the roll does not succeed, he does not recognize the Solar, and the Exalt remains a nameless, shadowy distortion in his memories.
