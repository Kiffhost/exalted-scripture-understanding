The Dragon-Blood is fire given flesh. She treats her [[Appearance]] as one dot higher, even above 5, when determining how many bonus dice it adds (Exalted, p. 218) to an influence roll made with [[Presence]] or [[Socialize]]. With a [[Presence]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Fire Aura to treat her [[Appearance]] as (Essence/2, rounded up) dots higher instead.
