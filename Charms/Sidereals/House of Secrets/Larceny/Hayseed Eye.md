Criminals and con artists seeking to prey on the Sidereal soon learn the folly of trying to cheat a master cheater. The Sidereal makes a special (Perception + Larceny) read intentions roll against a character. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
-  Is he planning to cheat, exploit, or take advantage of me? 
-  Is he planning to commit a crime? 
-  Does he think I suspect him? 
-  Do any crimes weigh on his conscience? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact. Reset: Once per scene.
