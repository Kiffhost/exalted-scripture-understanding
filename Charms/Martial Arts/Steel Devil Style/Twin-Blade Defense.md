*The Steel Devil narrowly parries away a strike with her second blade.*
This Charm can be used after failing to parry an attack; the Exalt pays three motes and converts points of Charge into an impromptu second Parry at a one-for-one rate, in order to deal with the attack’s remaining successes. If the Exalt is able to expend enough Charge to nullify the remaining successes, she strikes away the incoming attack with her second blade. If she can negate the attack with at least three Charge remaining, she is seen to cross her blades, catching the opponent’s blow between them, a technique called the Cross-Blade Catch.
