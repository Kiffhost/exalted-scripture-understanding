The Dragon-Blood is vivacity and allure made manifest in motion, dancing with irresistible sensuality. She converts the non-Charm dice added by her Appearance on any dance based Performance roll to non-Charm successes. Characters with a base Resolve at least two points lower than her Appearance must spend an additional point of Willpower to resist her influence, while those whose Resolve is five points lower cannot spend Willpower to resist at all. Waltz of Honeyed Wine can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) by playing on another characterâ€™s emotions, or by seducing him.
