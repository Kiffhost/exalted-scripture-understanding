Black Wind’s spirit speaks only in the moment of death, and has nothing to say to those who kill for passion or profit—its soul opens only to those who kill for an ideal. For such an individual, death becomes power. Once this Evocation has been awakened, Black Wind creates two blood blades when it slays a non-trivial opponent with a decisive attack, rather than one. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience. It awakens after the skycutter’s master uses it to kill a non-trivial opponent in direct support of a Major or Defining Principle.
