*Sorcery flows through Emerald Sunset like ichor through a demon’s veins.*

Emerald Sunset’s wielder may flurry Shape Sorcery actions with aim or threaten actions and suffers no flurry penalties for doing so. Once per scene, the wielder may reflexively aim while she flurries a Shape Sorcery action and a threaten action.
