The Lunar embodies divine retribution, a monster out of cautionary tales. If she witnesses someone engaging in any activity that she deems immoral based on her Principles or violating the customs of a culture to which she belongs or toward which she has a positive Tie, she must punish them. The punishmentâ€™s severity must be at least commensurate to the violation, and must come rapidly, before the Limit Break ends.
This ends if someone the Lunar seeks to punish convinces her that her own actions have violated one of her Major or Defining Intimacies.
