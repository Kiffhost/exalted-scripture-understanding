Strutting haughtily past her rivals, the Lunar drives them to frothing incoherence or stuttering rage. A successful influence roll also instills a Tie of her choice of irritation, anger, or disgust toward the Lunar (or her current shape) in targets of her choice. Affected characters suffer a âˆ’2 penalty to social and mental rolls for the scene.
