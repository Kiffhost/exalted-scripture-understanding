*The Solar moves across the battlefield like an implacable force.*
She may use this Charm on her turn to move away from a target without using a disengage action, so long as she uses her movement to enter into close range with another target and uses her attack action against that target. Though it is learned through [[Melee]], this Charm is expressly allowed to aid in close range [[Brawl]] and [[Martial Arts]] attacks.

### On [[Nimble Reaving Wind]]

A simple yet delicious effect. Enjoy!
