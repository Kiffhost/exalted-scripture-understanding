*The stylist acts in accordance with the quadrumvirate of redress: four patterns of Essence that overcome restraints on the heart, mind, body, and soul.*
The stylist rolls (Stamina + Medicine) to negate any effect she suffers that she could heal with Spirit-and-Body Purification Touch. The roll’s difficulty is the Essence of the character responsible, or a 1-5 difficulty for effects not used by a character. Success negates the effect; on failure, she can’t use this Charm against that affliction again. In combat, this also counts as a Join Battle roll.
### Enlightenment
This roll applies to all such effects the stylist suffers, even those she’s not aware of.
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Intimacy using this style or Medicine. This Charm can’t be reset by the Dawn Caste anima or similar effects.
