*The Sidereal invokes the auspices of the Rising Smoke to ensure her official communications swiftly meet their end in the hands of their recipients.*
The Sidereal burns a letter addressed to a fellow Sidereal, a god in the [[Lore/Factions/Bureau of Destiny|Bureau of Destiny]]’s employ, or any character who holds authority over her within a hierarchy or bureaucracy. It appears instantly, hidden discreetly against his skin, regardless of the distance between them. Noticing its appearance requires magical senses and a difficulty 7 ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll. The letter’s recipient can recognize its author if he’s met her in her true identity, smelling her anima banner on the paper before he reads it. The letter’s recipient can write on the letter and then burn it to send this response to the Sidereal, appearing as above.
