Taking her enemy’s strand of fate in her hands as she wrestles with him, the Sidereal binds him in manners both seen and unseen. When the Sidereal makes a grapple gambit and succeeds on the Initiative roll, her control roll inflicts an additional point of onslaught penalty, regardless of whether it succeeds. Any reduction of the attack roll’s target number also applies to the Initiative roll and control roll.
