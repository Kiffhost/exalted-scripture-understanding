*The Infernal cuts down her foe as he moves to attack, striking as swiftly as Adorjan kills.*

The Infernal responds to an attack with a decisive counterattack. If both attacks hit, the Infernal resets to her attacker’s base Initiative if it’s higher than hers.

If a character attacks the Infernal unprovoked outside of combat — or if she thinks one does — she must use this Charm to counterattack if she can pay its cost. She can pay one Willpower to resist this urge.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Kissed by Hellish Noon]] (p. XX) reflexively with this Charm, extending the counterattack’s range.
## [[Keys]]
#### Variety in Retaliation
The Infernal can counterattack with a gambit instead of a damaging attack.
#### Cherished Foe Appreciation (Melee 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal can use her attacker’s base Initiative instead of her own even if his attack missed. If her base Initiative equals or exceeds her attacker’s, she instead adds +2 to her base Initiative upon resetting.
