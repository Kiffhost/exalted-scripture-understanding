By incorporating sorcery and other arcana into their work, First Age artificers achieved feats beyond the grasp of latter-day smiths. This, specifically, is what is meant by First Age artifice (Exalted, pp. 243-244). Most artifacts constructed even in the First Age employed the more straightforward techniques of contemporary artificers. First Age artifice was reserved for grand and sublime feats that couldn’t otherwise be achieved.

Artifacts requiring Craft (First Age Artifice) include warstriders, airships, powered armor, miraculous infrastructure such as linked portals, sophisticated siege weaponry, automata with human-level intelligence, and anything else the Storyteller feels is incompatible with the setting of the Time of Tumult. 

Out of game, this subsystem supports the setting conceit that many First Age marvels could neither be maintained nor replaced after the Usurpation, and allows Solar characters to repair and rebuild a few miraculous wonders from that era without being able to restore the glories of the First Age singlehandedly. It also ensures that certain artifact types are sufficiently difficult to construct that characters can’t build them casually, and that they’re very rare in the Time of Tumult without being outright impossible to create in play. These restrictions are fuzzy and ultimately rely on Storyteller judgment. 

The section mark (§) denotes an artifact requiring Craft (First Age Artifice) to manufacture and repair. As a reminder, all crafting and repairs on such artifacts must be done with white craft points. 

Not all sorcery-augmented craft requires First Age Artifice techniques. Often, as with lorestones (p. 117), a sorcerous working is used to create some exotic ingredient or mystical reagent. Such workings cost no experience.
