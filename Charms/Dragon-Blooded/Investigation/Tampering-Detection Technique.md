Even the slightest disturbance at the scene of a crime can have consequences that ripple throughout an entire investigation. Success on a case scene roll reveals whether any attempt has been made to conceal evidence (Exalted, p. 224), although not the identity of the character responsible. Alternatively, this Charm can be used when the Dragon-Blood examines an item for signs of tampering. She can automatically tell if any character has used Larceny to interfere with that object in the last (Essence + Investigation) hours — picking a lock, forging credentials, hiding contraband inside a barrel, and so on. This reveals the nature of the tampering, but not the perpetrator’s identity or the time it occurred. With Investigation 4, Essence 3, the Dragon-Blooded can detect tampering that has occurred in the last (Essence + Investigation) days.
