The cloak conceals its nature, shrouding the sacred in darkness.
This Evocation conceals the cloak’s supernatural nature. Its appearance doesn’t change, but observers feel no differently about its cloth of spun darkness than they do any luxurious fabric, and take its moonsilver for the material’s mundane cousin. It’s impossible to tell that it’s an artifact without using magic. Characters who see through the Lunar’s [[Tell]] aren’t affected.
In animal shapes, the cloak vanishes, becoming an actual part of the Lunar’s [[Tell]]. In a snake’s shape, her scales become black as midnight; as a strix, her outstretched wings seem to contain the night sky. This doesn’t replace her [[Tell]], although it can alter it — a scar might become a scar-shaped void filled with starry darkness.
