*As the deathknight’s foes succumb to doubt and paranoia, she delivers a killing blow that seems to come from nowhere.*
When an enemy fails his roll opposing [[Knives Between Friends]], the Abyssal can use this Charm to reflexively make a decisive ambush against him (Exalted, p. 203). She can only attack once, even if multiple enemies fail. This doesn’t break her concealment if she attacks from stealth.
