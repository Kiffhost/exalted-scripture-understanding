The Solar becomes a killing blur, unstoppable as she whirls through a storm of blood and steel. This Charm splits the Exalt’s Initiative to make a series of (the lowest of her Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina) decisive attacks. These attacks may be directed at a single target, or multiple targets as the player desires. The player divides the Solar’s Initiative between the attacks when they activate the Charm, for the purpose of determining the damage of each attack. Each attack must have at least one Initiative allocated to it, and unlike normal decisive attack resolution, the Solar does not return to base Initiative until the final attack is resolved, and only loses Initiative for missed attacks if all of her attacks fail to connect. In the case of such a miss, the Exalt loses two Initiative per attack attempted. 

## Special activation rules

Attack-enhancing Charms such as Excellent Strike and Hungry Tiger Technique need only be paid a single time to enhance every attack in this sequence, but the Melee Excellency must be paid per attack. Iron Whirlwind Attack can be activated directly after using Peony Blossom Technique as if it were a Reflexive Charm.
