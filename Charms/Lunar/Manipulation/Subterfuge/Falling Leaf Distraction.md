*The Lunar’s voice captivates her audience with subtle harmonics, directing their attention away from the deft motions of her hands or her allies creeping through the shadows.*
She makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + {Larceny, [[Performance]], or Presence}) instill roll, ignoring multiple target penalties. Each character whose [[Resolve]] is beaten is drawn in by the Lunar’s patter. As long as she continues speaking — which she may do reflexively — they suffer a −(higher of Lunar’s [[Essence]] or 3) penalty on [[Awareness]] or [[Investigation]] rolls opposing [[Larceny]] or [[Stealth]] rolls. As this Charm relies on the Lunar occupying the center of attention, it doesn’t penalize rolls opposing her own [[Stealth]] attempts. Characters can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist this influence unless failing a roll would threaten a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]]. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes, the Lunar instead distracts affected characters that can see her, drawing their attention to her adorable or unusual behavior.
