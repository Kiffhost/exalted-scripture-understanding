*The Terrestrial sustains herself without need for sleep, renewing her wearied body by drawing on Earth [[Essence]].*
Once per day, she may spend an hour in meditation to gain all the benefits of a good night’s sleep, including a point of [[Willpower]]. She may use this Charm to remain awake for up to ([[Essence]] + [[Stamina]]) days without hindrance, but past that point, she ceases to regain [[Willpower]] from it until she’s received a full eight hours of sleep normally each day over as many days as she used this Charm to stay awake.
