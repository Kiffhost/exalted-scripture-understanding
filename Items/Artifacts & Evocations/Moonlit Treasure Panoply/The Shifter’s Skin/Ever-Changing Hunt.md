*Drawing on the Shifter’s Skin’s mercurial nature, the Lunar transforms her sacred hunt.*
The Lunar temporarily gains a single Lunar Charm that lets her take shapes, either by expanding how she can perform sacred hunts or other means. She must meet its prerequisites, but if it requires any [[Charms]] that also let her take shapes, she can substitute another Charm that does so. For example, if she chooses [[Face-Taker’s Gaze]], she may use [[Debt of Borrowed Skin]] instead of [[Whispering Heart Revelation]] to meet its prerequisites.

## Reset 
Once per story, unless reset by learning the chosen Charm normally. The Lunar may incur [[Experience Debt]] to do so and waives training times.
Awakening: This Charm can’t be bought with experience points. It awakens for free when the Lunar upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] in the course of a [[sacred hunt]].
