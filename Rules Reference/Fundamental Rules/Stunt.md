# TLDR
A stunt is a narration of an in-game action. Stunting (narrating/roleplaying) grants a mechanical bonus to its action (or static value, like [[Defense|Parry]] or [[Guile]]). The better the narration/roleplaying, the bigger the bonus.

# Stunting

Exalted is a game of cinematic action and mighty heroes who go crashing through the world and look cool doing it. Characters needn’t choose between doing the sensible thing or the stylish thing—the coolest course of action is also the optimal one. Such actions are known as *stunts*.

For an action to qualify as a stunt, it must fulfill two criteria, as approved by the Storyteller:

- The action must be cooler than a basic declaration of intent (see below for examples). 
- The action cannot be boring. This is not meant to act as a harsh quality bar players must strive to jump over—mostly it means repetitive stunts stop qualifying as stunts, as they’re no longer entertaining. **This also means any stunt so long and overwrought that it bores rather than excites isn’t a stunt.** 

Stunts may be used as often as desired—and to be clear, the average player can and should use a stunt to enhance almost every action her character takes. Storytellers are encouraged to err in the player’s favor when deciding what is or isn’t a stunt.

# One-Point Stunts

The benefits of stunting are simple: any rolled action enhanced by a stunt gains two extra dice. If the stunted action is the application of a static value (such as using [[Defense]] to block an opponent’s leaping sword slash), then that static value rises by 1. Players should be able to use a one-point stunt on almost every action.

# Two-Point Stunts

A two-point stunt stands above and beyond other stunts. These are intended to be less common than one-point stunts; to be a two-point stunt, the action needs to stand out memorably as a highlight of the scene.

Exceptional stunts on rolled actions are rewarded with two extra dice and one automatic success. Exceptional stunts on static value applications raise the static value by 2. A player might get two or three of these in an evening of play. 

*Whenever a player describes a two-point stunt, her character gains a point of Willpower*, up to a maximum of her permanent [[Willpower]] rating.

# Three-Point Stunts

These are stunts so cool that everyone at the table is impressed. These stunts are intended to be rare and memorable; to be a three-point stunt, the action needs to stand out as probably the coolest thing that’s going to happen during the entire session. Three-point stunts on rolled actions are rewarded with two extra dice and two automatic successes. Three-point stunts on static value applications raise the static value by 3. A player probably won’t manage a three-point stunt in every session—it’s rare to see more than one out of the entire group in the course of a night of play

**Whenever a player describes a three-point stunt, her character gains two points of Willpower**, which may take her above her permanent [[Willpower]] rating.

Finally, when a character performs an unnecessarily dangerous stunt (such as leaping over a roaring bonfire to strike at her opponent, or hurling herself off a tall building in an attempt to grapple a flying enemy), the Storyteller is urged not to level devastating consequences should the stunt fail. In the above examples, the character might have an opportunity to beat out the flames kindling on her clothing before suffering any damage, or should be provided a roll to grab onto a ledge or other surface to keep from plummeting to a messy death. Exalted players shouldn’t avoid reckless heroism for fear of the obvious danger
