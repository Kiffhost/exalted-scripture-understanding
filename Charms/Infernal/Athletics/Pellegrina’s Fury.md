*The Infernal draws on the hatred of Pellegrina, the Grinding Wind who destroys all stone that she touches, avenging an ancient slight against her mother Adorjan.*

Crimson wind surrounds the Infernal out to close range, eroding anything made predominantly out of stone. At bonfire anima, the wind extends to short range.

Any mundane stone exposed to the wind rapidly erodes, lowering the difficulty of feats of demolition against it by one for each purchase of [[Wind-Born Stride]] the Infernal has. The difficulty reduction increases by one for each minute of exposure, maximum (10 + purchases of [[Wind-Born Stride]]).

If an object or scenery’s difficulty is reduced to 0, it’s ground to dust completely unless it requires Strength 7+ for feats of demolition. If this destroys the surface the Infernal is standing on, it becomes difficult terrain (if it doesn’t fall away entirely), but until it’s fully destroyed, it will still support her weight as if undamaged.

Even stone that survives exposure is damaged. Rolls using damaged objects suffer a −1 penalty, but this can be mended with a scene of maintenance. Any cover that damaged scenery provides is reduced by one step. Earth elementals, constructs made of stone, and similar beings treat the wind as an environmental hazard with difficulty (Infernal’s Dexterity), Damage (Essence, maximum 5)A/round.
## [[Keys]]
#### Wind-Daughter’s Wrath (Athletics 5)
This Charm’s range becomes short, or medium at bonfire anima.
#### Skin-Flaying Wind Dance (Athletics 5, [[Wind-Born Stride]] x2) (+2m, 4i)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote, four-Initiative surcharge to invoke Adorjan alongside Pellegrina, extending the wind’s hazard to all living or undead beings.
