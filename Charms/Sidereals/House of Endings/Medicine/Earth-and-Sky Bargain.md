*Buried beneath a stone cairn by the Sidereal, a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and the Road erupts with ten spines of indigo light that rise skyward, revealing a spirit in such desperate peril that he might accept the Earth-and-Sky [[Bargain]], The Sidereal rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) to introduce the fact that there’s a god or elemental on the brink of permanent destruction nearby.*
(While some Exalted can kill spirits, more common causes of permanent death include puissant supernatural beings and monsters; certain supernatural diseases; exotic magical poisons; sorcerous workings that compromise immortality; etc.). She can specify the general kind of spirit — “a fire elemental,” “a martial god,” etc. — and its [[Essence]] rating, but not a specific spirit. The roll’s difficulty is the ([[Essence]] + [[Willpower]]) of the spirit; on a failed roll, the Sidereal still discovers a spirit of lesser strength [[Essence]] chosen by the Storyteller. If the Sidereal convinces the spirit to accept her bargain — an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216) — she binds it to her soul, granting the following benefits: 
- She gains his [[Cult]] rating. 
- She can temporarily access his [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]] for three motes each, which she must commit upon using this Charm. She can learn them permanently for eight experience points each. 
- She adds (his [[Essence]]) soak and gains [[Hardness]] (his [[Essence]] + [[Willpower]]). 
- She gains half his total health track as temporary health levels, rounding up for each type of level (e.g., if the god has five −1 levels and three −2 levels, the Sidereal would gain three −1 levels and two −2 levels). These levels are the first of their type to be filled and vanish when damaged. The Sidereal regains a single lost temporary level after a full night’s sleep, starting with −4 levels and moving up. 
- If the spirit’s an air or wood elemental or a god associated with those elements, the Sidereal adds his [[Essence]] to the number of motes she recovers each hour. The Sidereal can pay fifteen motes and one [[Willpower]] to transfer the bound spirit to a touched character, conferring the above benefits on him. She must still maintain her commit to this Charm. That character can’t transfer the spirit to others, nor can he return it to the Sidereal. Once this Charm ends, the bound spirit reforms. Its nature often changes to reflect the personality and passions of its host, and spirits weaker than their host may become more powerful. If the Sidereal maintains this Charm for its full duration, the spirit is unlikely to feel any obligation to her, but if she cuts it short so the spirit may be reborn earlier, it may be willing to perform a serious or even a life-defining task for her without requiring a roll.
