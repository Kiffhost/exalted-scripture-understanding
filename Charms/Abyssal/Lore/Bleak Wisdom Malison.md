*Confronting the weak with their frailties and follies, the Abyssal teaches the wisdom of despair.*
When the Abyssal uses Fatal Flaw Scrutiny to reveal a weakness in someone’s agenda, she can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to confront him with the futility of his actions. If her successes equal or exceed his Resolve, he suffers a –(Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) penalty on mental and social rolls related to his agenda, and 1s subtract successes. This lasts until the Abyssal uses Fatal Flaw Scrutiny on another character or until that character spends three Willpower to resist.
