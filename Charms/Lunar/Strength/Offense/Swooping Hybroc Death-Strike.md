After using [[Fatal Strix Flight]], the Lunar bounds upward in a flash, arriving at the apex of her victim’s arc in time to slam him back to earth. This counts as her move action for the round. She makes a reflexive decisive attack against her victim, with base damage equal to the amount that [[Mighty [[Ram]] Smash]] would have normally inflicted, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t include her [[Initiative]] or reset her to base. She doesn’t suffer falling damage from landing. 
## Protean 

In flight-capable shapes, the Lunar adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on the attack roll. She may remain in flight at the apex of her victim’s upward movement, instead of landing.
