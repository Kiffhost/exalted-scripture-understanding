The Exalt can bind together any two languages she knows into a third language which is intuitively understood by those listeners who understand at least one of the base languages. 
For four motes, one Willpower, she uses her Essence to fuse two such languages together.
For each additional three motes committed, she may fuse an additional language into the strain. A Solar who is gifted with knowledge of many languages can become the unifying voice of nations.
