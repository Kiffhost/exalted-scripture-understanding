*The Solar’s inner self rises closer to the surface.*
This Charm can be purchased to upgrade one of the personas enhanced by [[Legend Mask Methodology]], granting it an additional 25% of the Solar’s experience points and increasing its experience gain to two for every three the Solar earns. However, purchasing this Charm grants the persona a new [[Limit]] Trigger in addition to the Solar’s own. [[Draw the Curtain]] can be repurchased once for each persona the Solar wishes to enhance.
