---
The Dragon-Blood courts her reader’s passion with provocative language and sensuous choices of words, infusing erotic undertones into whatever she writes. This Charm functions identically to [[Incendiary Argument Approach]], except that instead of provoking the target to argue, the influence overwhelms him with passionate admiration and fascination for the author, bordering on lust. If he’s sexually attracted to the Dragon-Blood, he’ll attempt to seduce her, either by seeking her out in person or with a written declaration of lust. If he’s not sexually attracted (or his player invokes the Red Rule, Exalted, p. 222), he instead feels inspired to seek her out for friendly conversation. As with its prerequisite, [[Tantalizing Dragon’s Tongue]] can be used with [[Signature-Stealing Calligraphy]] to forge love letters.
