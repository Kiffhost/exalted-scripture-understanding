The Lawgiver’s keen ear, sharp eye and steady hand makes her an inveterate thief of words. With this Charm, the Solar can adapt the writing voice of another character. The Solar need only have read one manuscript or three smaller examples of the character’s writing in order to perfectly mimic his writing style. This Charm does not mimic the effects of [[Flawless Brush Discipline]], so the Solar may need to use that Charm to make her script all the more deceiving. Like the prerequisite, the difficulty to pierce this deception is the Solar’s ([[Linguistics]] + [[Essence]]) score at the time of writing. Combining this Charm with its prerequisite raises that difficulty by one. Stolen Voice Technique’s deception is automatically successful unless the target has a reason to scrutinize the writing.
