Her strength magnified by training and Essence, the stylist grabs and strikes with overwhelming force.
The stylist adds (Strength) dice on a decisive attack roll. Up to (Strength) attack roll extra successes let her reroll failed dice on a damage roll or on the Initiative and control rolls for a grapple gambit.

## Terrestrial
The stylist can only reroll (lower of Essence or Strength) dice.
Rearing up into a stance that makes her seem larger than she actually is, the stylist emulates the movements of an enraged bear.
The stylist gains the following benefits:  - She adds a non-Charm success on grapple attack and control rolls.
 - She reduces the Initiative cost of grapple gambits by 2.
 - She ignores the Defense penalty from grappling.
 - She adds (Strength) soak.


## Special activation rules

When the stylist wins control of a clinch against a nontrivial enemy, she may reflexively enter Bear Form.
