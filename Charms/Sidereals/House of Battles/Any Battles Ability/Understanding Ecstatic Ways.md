The Sidereal flenses away the consequences of her actions, freeing herself to partake in the ecstatic battle without concern for civilities and decorum. Any violent actions the Sidereal undertakes will not give offense to anyone, victim or bystander, nor will anyone be upset or angered by her actions, even if she kills her victim. This doesn’t prevent characters from fighting back or aiding those the Sidereal attacks, but they still hold no ill will against her. She may face legal consequences for her actions, but they’re conducted dispassionately, no matter how heinous her crime. Resisting this Psyche effect costs three Willpower. The Sidereal’s victim and those with positive Ties toward him Characters with a positive Tie to a may resist for one Willpower instead. Trivial characters can’t resist with Willpower.
