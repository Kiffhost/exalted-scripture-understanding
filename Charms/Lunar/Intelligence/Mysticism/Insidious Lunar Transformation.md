*The Lunar feeds someone her blood as a catalyst for transformation, twisting him into a bestial shape.*
In combat, this requires a difficulty 5 [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] gambit. Outside of combat, her target must either be willing, helpless to stop her, or tricked into consuming her blood unknowingly. The Lunar then rolls ({Intelligence + [Lore, [[Occult]], or Presence}) opposing his ([[Stamina]] + {Integrity or Resistance}) roll. Success transforms him into an animal whose shape she possesses (except Legendary [[Size]] or Minuscule [[Size]] forms). This functions like Lunar shapeshifting (p.
