Sekhem belches forth fire so hot that the air itself seems to boil. This is a decisive attack that adds (Heat/2, round up) to the damage roll and is supplemented by Fire That Burns Flame at no cost. If the attack is blocked with or loses a clash against a close range weapon, it superheats that weapon as per successful use of Smoldering Steel Ignition. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy. 

## Resonant

At Heat 7+, this Evocationâ€™s Willpower cost is waived.
