*The Sidereal’s quick wits win the day, harrying foes with well-placed shots.*
The Sidereal reduces the Initiative cost of a disarm, distract, or unhorse gambit by one. She can also do so with custom gambits enhanced by Generalized Ammunition Technique. Any target number reduction on the attack roll also applies to the Initiative roll.
