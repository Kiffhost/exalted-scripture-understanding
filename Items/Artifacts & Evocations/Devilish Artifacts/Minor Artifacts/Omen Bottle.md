The artifice of these bottles was perfected in the high First Age, when releasing the atmosphere of Hell into Creation was considered a parlor trick, an exotic luxury, or an indulgence for the comfort of demon slaves. Each is an irregularly shaped bottle — no two the same — the size of a closed fist, made from green-grey frosted glass and fitted with a stopper of white jade. They’re fragile as artifacts go, but almost two dozen of First Age manufacture have survived, and several have been crafted since by enterprising diabolists.

An omen bottle siphons and distills the ambient Essence of Hell. Once attuned for five motes, an empty omen bottle can be filled by leaving it open in Hell for a full day, during which it slowly fills with varicolored liquid that churns and bubbles with vapor. Once filled and stoppered, the bottle can be opened to release the stored omen-weather. The type of omen-weather depends on where in Hell the bottle was filled and its proximity to any demons or phenomena that affect Hell’s weather. Emotive rains, technicolored clouds, silver sandstorms, acrid fog, violet frost, and stone sleet are all possible, though Adorjan’s winds are beyond their power to contain.

Only the attuned character can open an omen bottle. When she does, the stored omen-weather extends out to medium range. It extends out to long range after a minute, and an additional band of extreme range beyond that after a few minutes more. It lasts for up to a day. Omen-weather tends to be uncomfortable or mildly hazardous for inhabitants of Creation, but demons find it pleasant compared to Creation’s hatefully pure waters and burning sunlight. Most omen-weather inflicts a −2 penalty on appropriate rolls or −1 to appropriate static values: Hegra’s driving passion-winds might penalize both rolls to move through them and Resolve against inspire rolls. Other omen-weather may create environmental hazards, typically with difficulty 3, Damage 1L/minute. The Storyteller can vary these effects to better fit the omen-weather’s nature.

Omen bottles aren’t supernaturally durable and can be smashed as easily as thick glass. Smashing a full omen-bottle unleashes the stored omen-weather as far as a mile outward and may produce more dramatic effects, including higher penalties or deadlier hazards. However, such intense manifestations last only an hour. Reconstructing a shattered omen bottle requires a superior repair project.
