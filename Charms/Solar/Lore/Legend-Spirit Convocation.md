*This Charm upgrades the prerequisite, allowing it to be used on weapons and armor forged of natural metals such as brass, iron, and steel.*
As the Solar clasps a weapon, she speaks her legend into it, and the whispers of mysterious spirits flow into it, filling it with tales of her past incarnations. The empowering effect of [[Wake the Sleeper]] is less profound on such mortal panoplies: the roll is always difficulty 2, and the weapon gains a single Instant-duration Evocation whether it is successful or not. If the roll succeeds, the weapon may (optionally) become visually transformed by the Solar’s anima, taking on elements of her iconic form, and gains a passive or Permanent-duration Evocation that enhances the weapon or armor in question. 

## Special activation rules

In order to enhance mortal gear, it must be a favored and select weapon or armor of the character in question. The Solar may explicitly use this Charm to enhance the weaponry of someone for whom she holds a Major or greater [[Intimacy]], positive or negative, so long as they join the Lawgiver in holding the object aloft as she channels the [[Essence]] of legend through its form.

### On [[Legend-Spirit Convocation]]

The backer asked for a Charm that would expand what [[Wake the Sleeper]] could do, so I wrote this. Backer: Nick Khorlin
