The Sidereal weaves heartstrings like threads of fate, laying siege to the hearts of others with her own mighty passions. The Sidereal rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) to wordlessly inspire whatever emotion she currently feels in against all characters she can perceive, ignoring multiple target penalties. She can’t choose to exclude characters from this, and is automatically affected herself, with no chance to resist. Inspired passions penalize [[Guile]] as with [[Resolve]] against rolls to discover a character’s emotional state or discern their emotion-based [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], even those unrelated to the inspired passion. Characters with an [[Intimacy]] instilled by [[Impose Nature]] must express the emotion in a way that supports it. Those affected by [[Presence]]-in-Absence Technique must do so in a way that unknowingly makes progress toward the circumstances under which the influence is triggered. Resisting this influence requires entering a Decision Point and invoking a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] to pay one [[Willpower]]. With an [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a four-mote surcharge to grant affected characters a pool of (her [[Essence]]) dice each, which they can add to any roll supported by the inspired emotion. These dice are lost when the scene ends.
