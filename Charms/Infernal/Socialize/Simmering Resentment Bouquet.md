*The Infernal savours the perfume of strife and iniquity, unable to resist such sweet suffering.*

The Infernal makes a special read intentions roll to seek out suffering within a community. She must first spend an hour exploring it, interacting with one of its busier locales, or observing it from a high location. She can’t assess a community larger than a group of villages or a town with a single use — she must go district by district in a smaller city, or neighbour by neighbourhood in larger ones.

The roll’s difficulty equals the highest Guile among community members who’d wish to conceal its turmoil from her. Success reveals the most significant issue causing hardship, misery, or fear within the community.

For every three extra successes, the Infernal’s player can ask the Storyteller a follow-up question about an identified issue, like “Where is this issue most prevalent?” or “How long ago did this issue start?” She can also ask him to identify an additional issue. If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind, the Infernal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.

With Essence 3, the Infernal can survey a smaller city or an entire district of a large city with a single use of this Charm, but must do so from an elevated vantage point that allows her to see at least most of the area, like a high tower.

With Essence 5, the Infernal can use this Charm on a grand scale once per session, letting her examine a multiple smaller cities, a huge metropolis, or even a modestly sized kingdom. However, she must be able to see the entirety of it from an elevated vantage, like when observing from a mountaintop or airship.
