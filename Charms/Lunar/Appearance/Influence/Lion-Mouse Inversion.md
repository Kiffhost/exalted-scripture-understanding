*Trembling in fear before a harmless songbird or confidently approaching a snarling wolf, the Lunar changes the way others perceive her interlocutor.*
As she interacts with someone, she makes a special ([[Appearance]] + {Performance or Presence}) instill roll with ([[Manipulation]]) bonus dice against all characters who witness the interaction, ignoring multiple-target penalties. Affected characters perceive the object of the interaction as per the appropriate effect of Predatorand-Prey Mirror (p. XX) and canâ€™t spend [[Willpower]] to resist. The character the Lunar interacts with gains +2 [[Resolve]] against this influence and can resist normally.
