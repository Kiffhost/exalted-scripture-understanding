**This Ability is important in combat.** 

[[Thrown]] is the Ability used for weapons designed to be thrown at an enemy, rather than those which fire projectiles. Throwing knives, shuriken, javelins, chakrams, and nets are all used with this Ability.

# Weapons

Note that thrown weapons have a variable [[Accuracy]] based on the target's [[Range]].
