*The Lunar’s flesh flows into or out of her armor, fitting it as naturally as a second skin.*
She can complete a minute’s worth of effort to [[Donning & Removing Armor|don or remove armor]] (Exalted, p. 591) in one turn. Alternatively, she ignores armor mobility penalties on one action. The latter effect costs two motes if used to negate heavy armor’s mobility penalty. An [[Essence]] 2 repurchase lets the Lunar use this Charm to assist another character in rapidly donning or [[Donning & Removing Armor|removing armor]]. She can also accelerate [[TACKING AND BARDING MOUNTS|tacking a mount]] (Exalted, p. 204) or negate her mount’s mobility penalty from barding.
