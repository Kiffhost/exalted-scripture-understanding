*The bleak saint has transcended the lies of embodiment. She knows that she is not her flesh, but a wisp of oblivion imprisoned within it.*
The stylist severs her self-identification with her body, drawing from one of her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] representing a positive outlook on death. She can use this Charm on her turn to gain the following benefits:
 - Clad in an aegis of her own flesh, she gains ([[Intimacy]]) armored [[soak]] and ([[Intimacy]] + [[Stamina]]) [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t count as wearing armor.
 - She reduces the total penalty she suffers from wounds, poison, crippling effects deprivation, or similar causes by ([[Intimacy]]/2, rounded up).
 - She’s immune to [[threaten]] rolls and other fear-based [[influence]] that rely on the threat of causing bodily harm, as well as [[bargain]] rolls or any other influence that appeals to pleasures of the flesh.
 - Any Intimacies incompatible with her alienation from her body are suppressed completely for this Charm’s duration. They return when this Charm ends, but are weakened by one step. Examples of subjects covered by such Intimacies include fear of death or injury; feelings about one’s appearance or body; or desire for food, drink, drugs, sex, or other bodily pleasures.
This Charm can’t be used outside of the stylist’s turn.
