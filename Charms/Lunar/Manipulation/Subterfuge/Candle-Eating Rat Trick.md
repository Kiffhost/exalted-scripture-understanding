The Lunar swallows the light of day to bring the night. Upon spending 5+ muted motes while her anima is dim, she extinguishes all light sources other than anima banners within medium range. Alternatively, she can extinguish a single light source within long range. Magical light sources relight themselves at scene’s end; mundane light sources must be relit normally. If the Lunar uses Clouds [[Cover]] Moon together with this Charm, a single activation covers all extinguished light sources, and she doubles 8s. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
