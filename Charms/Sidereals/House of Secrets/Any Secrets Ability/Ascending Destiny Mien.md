The Sidereal gets on her formidable intellect in delicate negotiations and clandestine intrigues, employing deductive reasoning to plot out a path through a conversation. When calculating Guile and Resolve, the Sidereal can use a Secrets Caste Ability instead of Integrity or Socialize. She may also use Intelligence instead of Appearance to add bonus dice on influence rolls (Exalted, p. 218).
