*The Lunar’s [[Essence]] seethes with inchoate possibilities of form, monstrous shapes yearning to become.*
When the Lunar uses [[Hybrid Body Transformation]], she can choose an additional two dots of mutations from Perfected Hybrid Interaction’s repertoire, which need not reflect her spirit shape. When she uses [[Deadly Beastman Transformation]], she can choose another two dots. She can choose different mutations each time.
