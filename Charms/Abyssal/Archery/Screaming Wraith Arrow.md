*An arrow of pure malice flies from the Abyssal’s bow, and those struck by it feel their flesh, blood, and [[Essence]] scream in torment.*
The Abyssal makes a withering attack against an enemy within short range, adding her [[Initiative]] to its raw damage. This resets her [[Initiative]] to base, though she still gains [[Initiative]] from the attack as usual.
If the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]] is at least ten higher than her target’s, the added damage is post-soak.
With [[Essence]] 4, if this crashes its target, he suffers (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) dice of lethal decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]], as his heart seizes from fear.
