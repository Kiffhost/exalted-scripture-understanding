The strange beast Tulat was possessed of ten thousand faceless shapes and diverse secret arts of concealment, for to be perceived was agony to him. Heaven was his greatest foe, for while most were blinded to him, he could not escape Yu-Shan’s unwavering eye, nor purge his history from its capacious records. While the Burnt Temple Riots threw Heaven into upheaval, Tulat made his way into the city, taking the shape of a vine to creep up the Forbidden Manse of Ivy’s walls, to destroy its records of his secret name and nature. Here, Tulat found himself thwarted, for he was seen by the Oracle Senn. She greeted him by name: “Hail, great Tulat, in your form of ivy. What brings you to visit Heaven?” said she. The beast, much aggrieved at this, answered tersely. “My business is my own, and my name is not for you to use.” “But your business is within,” she replied, undeterred. “Perhaps we can help one another.” “And how,” hissed Tulat, “might we do that?” “I am due for an important meeting inside,” said Senn, “but have foolishly left my manse bare-footed, and will surely be ridiculed by my superiors. If it is within your power, perhaps you could take the form of some meager footwear, and we may enter together without incident.” “Meager?” hissed Tulat, whose pride was legend. “I, who possess ten thousand faceless shapes, will become only the finest of sandals.” “If it is within your power,” replied Senn. “Then behold!” And indeed, Senn had never seen a pair of sandals to match Tulat: the wood of him was rich dark mahogany, gleaming with mother-of-pearl, and his lachets cords of gold. Quick as a flash, the Oracle drove a pair of starmetal nails through the sandals’ heels, for she had long foreseen the unforeseeable beast’s coming. Glinting with light gleaned from the polestar, the nails bound Tulat to his shape. He howled and gnashed, but could not change. Senn attended the meeting to report her assignment complete, and was complimented by all on her fine sandals.
