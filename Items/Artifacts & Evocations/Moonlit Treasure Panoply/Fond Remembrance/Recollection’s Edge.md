*With a deft stroke, Fond Remembrance’s wielder alters her foes’ recollection of events.*
The wielder makes a withering attack with double 9s on the damage roll. If she crashes an enemy, she may inflict the effects of a false memory gambit by paying its [[Initiative]] cost.
## Resonant
If the wielder doesn’t crash her enemy but still deals 5+ withering damage, she can still inflict a false memory, but must make an [[Initiative]] roll as per the gambit.
## Dissonant
The wielder can’t double more than (lower of [[Essence]] or [[Strength]]) 9s. She must make an [[Initiative]] roll to inflict the false memory.
