The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] exhibits a new sensory organ, such as a luminous forked tongue capable of tasting souls or vibrating crystalline tines that can detect emotion. On selecting this power, the Infernal’s player describes an area of sensory specialty that her new senses cover that would not be evident to her conventional senses, like the presence of intelligent thought, emotions, souls, or Essence. It has the following effects:
- The Storyteller should inform the Infernal if the subjects of her sense are present and where they can be found. This doesn’t circumvent other characters’ [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth|Stealth]], [[Guile]], or other relevant traits — e.g., if the Infernal wants to sample a character’s thoughts, she still needs a read intentions roll.
- The Infernal can use ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) rolls to detect and examine details related to her area of sensory specialty at a difficulty set by the Storyteller. A third eye that can detect the presence of thoughts might roll against a character’s [[Guile]] to glean information from their surface thoughts, while a soul-tasting tongue could detect the presence of spiritual maladies, pacts and other magic that affects the soul, rolling against the Essence of their originator.
- The Infernal adds (higher of Essence or 3) on [[Perception]] rolls within her area of sensory expertise and ignores penalties.
