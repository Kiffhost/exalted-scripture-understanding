The Lunar’s eyes are everywhere and nowhere, watching her foes from countless vantages. For a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, she can use Sense-Borrowing Methodonallanimalsofasinglespecieswithinlongrange: sparrows roosting in an abandoned manse, rats infesting a caravel’s hold, ants crawling through a household’s kitchen, etc. While observing through them, she makes only one Perception roll, adding dice equal to the group of animals’ Size (Exalted, p. 206). This is halved, rounded up, if the animals are Minuscule Size. She ignores penalties if the majority of the sense-ridden animals perceiving something are unimpeded by that penalty. Once an animal leaves this Charm’s range, the Lunar’s link with it ends. If the Lunar ceases meditating, her Sense-Borrowing Method ends. Hundred-Eyed Watcher is incompatible with non-animals’ senses. A Perception 5, Essence 4 repurchase lets the Lunar borrow the senses of all animals of one species within (Essence) miles, or within a territory claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation (p. XX). 

## Special activation rules

When the Lunar uses Watchful Spider Stance, she may reflexively activate Sense-Borrowing Method, waiving Hundred-Eyed Watcher’s Willpower surcharge. This extends its duration to Indefinite.
