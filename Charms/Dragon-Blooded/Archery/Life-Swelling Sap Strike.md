*The Dragon-Blood’s arrow bursts into a crush of ever-growing roots or vines in midflight, entangling her enemy in thick plants.*
She makes a distract gambit (Exalted, p. 200). On a success, her projectile bursts into growing vines, inflicting a −1 mobility penalty on the distracted character — which stacks with penalties from armor — for the rest of the scene. He or one of his allies can cut away the vines with a difficulty 3 gambit using an edged weapon, or the Storyteller might deem other actions or conditions sufficient. At the end of each round in which he remains entangled, he loses a point of [[Initiative]] (which the Dragon-Blood doesn’t gain). Battle groups lose one Magnitude instead. If the Dragon-Blood pays a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge, an undead crashed by this attack is incapacitated, crumbling into soil. This surcharge is waived against trivial foes. This doesn’t apply to stronger undead, such as nephwracks, [[Deathlords]], or undead Exalted. The body of any living mortal slain while covered in vines won’t harbor a hungry ghost. Outside of combat, the Dragon-Blood may use this Charm on dying mortals to ensure they leave no hungry ghosts, waiving the [[Willpower]] cost for willing targets. In Wood Aura, the Dragon-Blood may use this Charm to make a standard decisive attack instead of a distract gambit.
