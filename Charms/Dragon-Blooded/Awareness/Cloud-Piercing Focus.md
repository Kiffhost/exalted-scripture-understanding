Neither ocean depths nor raging flame nor swirling sands can hinder a keen Terrestrial eye. As an Earth Charm, this negates visual penalties from dust storms, sandstorms, or similar obstructions. As a Fire Charm, it negates such penalties from smoke, fire, or volcanic fumes. As a Water Charm, it negates penalties from mist, rain, or being underwater. Regardless of the version used, the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s sight is extended to its full normal range.
