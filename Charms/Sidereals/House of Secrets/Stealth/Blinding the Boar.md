Casting forth shadows of a thousand possible futures, the Sidereal conceals the truths of her existence from another. The Sidereal rolls (Manipulation + Stealth) against the Resolve of a character within long range. If she succeeds, that character, can’t focus on any specific details about her, though he can still perceive her location and actions. He can’t understand anything she says and suffers a penalty of (1 + Sidereal’s extra successes, maximum 5) on rolls targeting only her. He suffers −1 Defense and Guile against her. Special activation rolls: This Charm can be flurried with Stealth rolls.
