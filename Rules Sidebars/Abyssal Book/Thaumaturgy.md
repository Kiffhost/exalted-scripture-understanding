Most of the people that Creation calls “necromancer” aren’t initiates of the Ivory Circle proper, but those who’ve mastered certain thaumaturgical rites that allow them to conjure, animate, bind, and banish the dead. These are learned like any other thaumaturgical rituals (Exalted, p. 490). Some sample thaumaturgical necromancy might include: 
[[Breath of Unlife]]
[[Final Testament]]
[[Tear-Stained Talisman]]
