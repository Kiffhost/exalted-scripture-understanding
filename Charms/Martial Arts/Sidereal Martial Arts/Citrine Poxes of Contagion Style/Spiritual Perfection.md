*The martial artistâ€™s understanding of the many vectors by which her Essence might be corrupted shields her from such afflictions.*
The stylist clashes an attempt to inflict a poison, disease, crippling effect, Shaping effect, Psyche effect, possession, or sorcerous curse on her, rolling (Wits + Medicine), adding a free full Excellency (including target number reduction for Sidereals). If the effect is normally unrolled, the opposing character makes an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll. Success negates that effect and renders her immune to all further effects of that type for the scene. 
## Enlightenment
Success also negates all such effects already afflicting the stylist.
