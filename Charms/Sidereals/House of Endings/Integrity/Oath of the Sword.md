*The Sidereal has sworn upon the Sword and the pitiless Maiden who wields it, vowing to die before forsaking her duty to Creation.*
When a persuade roll or other influence would cause the Sidereal to act against a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]], her oath calls down a doom to stay her hand. She suffers unavoidable lethal damage equal to the [[Willpower]] cost to resist the influence. The Storyteller chooses what form this takes: being hit by a stray arrow mid-battle, coughing up blood, being struck by lightning, etc. Using this Charm terminates the offending influence and lets the Sidereal roll ([[Intimacy]]) dice, losing [[Limit]] equal to her successes. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by upholding a Defining [[Intimacy]] of that opposes the rejected influence or a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] of loyalty or duty. Reckoners can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
