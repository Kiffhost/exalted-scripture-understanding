Those who seek to subvert the Sidereal’s mind only replenish her quiver; thoughts that might harm her are easily turned against her foes. To use this Charm, the Sidereal must be suffering a Psyche effect, Shaping effect, or [[Derangement]]. She draws it from herself as an arrow of crimson stardust and uses it to make a decisive attack. If its damage exceeds her target’s [[Resolve]], as modified by any applicable [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he succumbs to that effect as though he were its original target and the Sidereal’s freed from it. If the effect doesn’t make sense for the new target (e.g., a Psyche effect compelling him to seduce himself), the Storyteller should modify it appropriately. 
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset by defeating a significant enemy who’s successfully used a Psyche or Shaping effect against the Sidereal this story.
