Those who cling to their selfhood blind themselves to infinity. The stylist strikes her target’s own perception of himself, a decisive attack opposing the higher of his Defense or Resolve. Appropriate Intimacies can bolster his Resolve against this. It ignores Hardness and does not deal damage; instead, each success on the damage roll causes the enemy to lose one Willpower. The stylist resets to base Initiative as usual. If the stylist’s damage roll successes beat her target’s Willpower or if he’s depleted of all temporary Willpower, his mind is flooded with visions of other lives he might have lived, until he can no longer tell which life is real: 
-  He gains a Defining Principle of “I’m not sure who I am.” It supports all Psyche effects used against him. It can’t be weakened or altered by any means, except as below. 
-  He suffers a −3 penalty on mental rolls, social rolls that involve his identity or history, and Willpower rolls against Derangement. 
-  Whenever his memory of his past becomes relevant — meeting an old friend, recounting a story his mother told him, trying to remember who his spouse is — he must roll (Wits + Integrity) at difficulty (stylist’s Perception + 3). On a failed roll, he instead remembers the details of a possible life, determined by the Storyteller. Some characters are especially susceptible to this: Getimians, whose true lives never happened; people suffering Derangements, Psyche effects, or other magic that impede their ability to tell what’s real; and the Fair Folk, whose identities are supremely mutable. Such characters halve their base Resolve against both against the attack roll and to determine if they suffer the Psyche effect. When a victim succeeds on a roll to remember his true past, learns something important about himself that he’d forgotten, or has some experience that affirms his true identity, he may pay three Willpower to weaken the instilled Principle by one step. Once this Principle has been fully eroded, the Psyche effect ends. He gradually regains any forgotten memories over the next few months, though he won’t forget memories of his other lives. Enlightenment: If the stylist is within close range of a reflective surface showing her target, she can use this Charm by striking at him, making the attack unblockable and undodgeable.
