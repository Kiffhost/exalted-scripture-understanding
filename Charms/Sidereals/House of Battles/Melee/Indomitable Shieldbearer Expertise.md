*The Sidereal fights with a seasoned veteran’s caution and restraint, avoiding the risks that cost callow troops their lives.*
The Sidereal waives the Initiative cost of full defenses, letting her use them while crashed. She can flurry full defenses with non-attack actions, which doesn’t penalize her Defense.
While wielding a Shield weapon, the Sidereal ignores that tag’s damage penalty. She can also flurry full defenses with attacks, paying an additional two motes each time she does so.
