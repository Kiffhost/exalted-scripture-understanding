*Colorful raindrops of venomous emotion swirl around the Infernal's arrow, a downpour of torrential passions.*

If the Infernal deals damage with a decisive attack, her target is poisoned with an emotion of her choice. It has Damage 2i/round, Duration (3 + attack roll extra successes) rounds, and a -2 penalty. If the enemy doesn't roll enough successes to negate the poison entirely, he's also suffused with the chosen emotion, as if by an inspire roll. The poison doesn't deal decisive damage to crashed enemies. Instead, they lose Willpower equal to the successes on the damage roll. If they have no Willpower remaining, they suffer bashing damage instead.

The poison's duration is increased by two rounds if the Infernal is experiencing the same emotion, whether through an effect like an inspire roll or roleplaying her strong passions in the same scene.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal's Devil-Body has the Toxic Apotheosis feature, she can choose to substitute this Charm's poison for that feature's standard traits when she enters her Devil-Body.
### Keys
#### Psychedelic Rainbow Venom
Instead of suffusing poisoned characters with an emotion, the Infernal can cause them to gain a single Minor Derangement of her choice for as long as they remain poisoned (Exalted, p. 168). An affected character must immediately roll against the Derangement. If they're reduced to zero Willpower by the poison, they gain that Derangement permanently.
#### Indelible Prismatic Stains (Essence 2)
The poison's damage and penalty are increased by one, or by two if the Infernal is experiencing the inflicted emotion.
#### One Hundred Colors Stain (Archery 4, Essence 3, Indelible Prismatic Stains)
The Infernal always gains Indelible Prismatic Stains' bonus. No matter how many successes a character rolls, they can't reduce the poison's duration below one round.
