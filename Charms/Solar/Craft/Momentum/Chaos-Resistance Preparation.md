The Solar can reinforce an object so that the Wyld cannot touch it. The Lawgiver spends up to an hour treating an object no more than (Essence) yards in radius. If the object is worn or wielded, it protects itself and the wielder/ wearer from the twisting effects of the Wyld. This protection is limited: in the bordermarches a character can go (Solar’s Essence) days without ill effect. This resistance is halved in the middlemarches, and reduced to hours in the deep Wyld. If the character only has partial protection—say a caravan guard wielding only a treated pike— then this protection is reduced to hours and minutes respectively. Chaos-Resistance Preparation can also be used to treat objects, and like and labeled objects traveling in auspicious arrays stack their protections, allowing groups of treated objects to survive Wyld journeys with the same benefits of a character wearing multiple treated items. At Essence 3+, the Exalt may pay fifteen motes, one Willpower to use this Charm on the project scale (p. 239), working for (10 - Stamina) hours to cover a considerable number of goods and vehicles or arms and armor. She may protect the hull of a small trade ship, as well as its rigging and sails, and need not protect the cargo or provisions below decks, or she may protect several wagons, singlehandedly preparing a small caravan for a trip through chaos-tainted lands.
