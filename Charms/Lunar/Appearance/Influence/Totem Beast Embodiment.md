*The Lunar clothes herself in the [[Essence]] of one of the beasts that dwells in her blood, assuming the role it plays in a particular culture.*
When stunting an influence roll with any Attribute, if her stunt’s description invokes an animal whose shape she possesses and its cultural significance to her targets, she adds a free full Excellency. For instance, if the Lunar targets members of a nomadic clan that fears wolves because they prey on the nomads’ flock, she could enhance a threaten roll by adopting a lupine posture or wolfish grin. This Charm can only be used once per day. 
## Protean
If the Lunar is in the shape of the invoked animal, waive this Charm’s cost.
