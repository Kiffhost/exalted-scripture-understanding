*Channeling power into her weapon, the Solar strikes a blow against a distant foe.*
A colorless ribbon of concentrated force leaps from her blade and arcs toward her target. This Charm allows the Solar to launch a decisive attack against opponents at short range. This attack ignores hardness, and does ([[Essence]]) automatic successes in damage to scenery, passing through objects it destroys to strike targets behind cover. 
Furthermore, if the Exalt withholds her attack in order to clash (p. 202), she may launch this attack reflexively in order to clash a ranged opponent’s attack.
