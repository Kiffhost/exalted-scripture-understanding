Dragon-Blooded cavalry learn to ride and fight together in martial harmony, creating openings in even the strongest defenses. This Charm can be used when a mounted ally successfully lands an attack against an enemy within short range of the Dragon-Blood. She may reflexively move up to one range band towards that enemy and make a decisive attack using any combat Ability, adding her mount’s Speed bonus to the attack roll. This counts as her combat action for the round, and she cannot use this Charm if she’s already attacked earlier in the round, but it doesn’t count against her movement action.
