*The Infernal forcibly inverts the Essence of a bound spirit, wrenching it into a material form that it might go forth and serve her.*

The Infernal forcibly materializes one of her bound demons (p. XX), or a spirit of another kind that she’s bound with a spell. A materialized demon’s form may temporarily shift to reflect the Infernal’s nature more so than the demon’s progenitor, particularly if the Infernal has [[Swallowing the Scorpion]] (p. XX).
## [[Keys]]
#### Hell-Emptying Invocation (Occult 4, Essence 2) (+2m, 1wp)
For a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, the Infernal makes a ({Charisma or Intelligence} + Occult) roll and materializes up to one allied spirit within long range per success. She counts 6s as successes for this, but only to materialize First Circle demons. This key can be used with any allied spirit, not just bound demons, though such characters’ appearance isn’t altered.
