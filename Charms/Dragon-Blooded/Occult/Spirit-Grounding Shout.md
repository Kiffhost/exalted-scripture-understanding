Rending the air with a fierce kiai, the Dragon-Blood strikes that which cannot be struck. She can strike a dematerialized character with an attack made with any Ability. If the Exalt is unable to see her target, her attack roll suffers a âˆ’3 penalty. If the Exalt uses this Charm on her next turn to attack the same enemy, its mote cost is lowered by one. This discount can be stacked, to a minimum cost of zero. Attacking another character or going a round without attacking that spirit resets the discount to zero.
