The Sidereal burns away the weightiness of steel and stone, making the heaviest burdens as light as ash in her hands. The Sidereal diminishes a touched object’s weight, reducing the Strength minimum of feats of demolition against it by (Essence/2, rounded up). Armors’ mobility penalties are reduced by the same amount, as are similar penalties from other burdensome loads. It smells distinctively of smoke. This Charm can be used on multiple objects, but its effects can’t be stacked on a single object.
