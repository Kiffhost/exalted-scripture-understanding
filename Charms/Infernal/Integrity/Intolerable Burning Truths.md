*The Infernal is beyond all human conceptions of love and hate.*

Upon purchasing this Charm, the Infernal’s player chooses one its keys, warping her perspective on love and hate.
## [[Keys]]
#### Existence is Agony
The Infernal gains one mote when she voluntarily forms or strengthens a negative Tie. Once per session, she can roll (Intimacy + 2) dice when she upholds a negative Tie. She may strengthen the Intimacy one step before rolling. She gains Willpower equal to her successes, minimum one, and twice that many motes. However, she must pay one Willpower to show mercy to someone she has a negative Tie for when she has an opportunity to harm him. Sparing them to prolong their suffering doesn’t run afoul of this prohibition.
#### Hate Springs Eternal
If the Infernal uses a negative Tie to an individual to bolster her Resolve, it can’t be penalized by positive Intimacies of any kind unless they have greater intensity. Even then, the penalty is reduced by two. However, the Infernal must pay one Willpower to help a character that she has a negative Tie toward. This doesn’t apply if she believes her own life depends on doing so.
#### Mother Before Daughter
The Infernal gains +2 Resolve against influence that would cause her to harm someone she had a positive Tie toward. If she cites that Tie in a Decision Point, its intensity counts as one step higher. If it’s already Defining, the Willpower cost to resist is lowered by one. However, she must pay one Willpower to purposefully harm a character that she has a positive Tie toward. This doesn’t apply if she believes the benefits of her action for that character will outweigh the harm done.
#### Never Forgive
The Infernal gains +2 Resolve against influence that would weaken a negative Tie or alter negative memories related to such a Tie. When she recovers Willpower from resting, she also gains one mote for each negative Tie she has, maximum (Essence + Integrity). However, she must pay one Willpower to voluntarily weaken a negative Tie.
#### Trust is Naïve
Any influence that would cause the Infernal to believe something bad about a character that she has a positive Tie toward is unacceptable. This isn’t optional. This can be circumvented only if she’s presented with significant evidence and has a Major or Defining Intimacy that supports the influence. She must pay one Willpower voluntarily believe anything bad about such a character, and only when she has at least some evidence.
