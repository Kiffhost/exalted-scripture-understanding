Reaching into the Essence of the world, the Solar channels condemnation through a bestial agent. Though it is a reflexive Charm, this Charm supplements a familiar’s attack against an immaterial foe. If the familiar successfully grapples and establishes clinch control of the immaterial, it is rendered temporarily vulnerable to physical attacks for the clinch’s duration. If the Exalt has enhanced this Charm with Familiar-Honing Instruction, the player may choose to lower the cost of this Charm by one mote per success, reducing the bonus dice added by FamiliarHoning Instruction by one for each less mote she pays to activate Phantom-Rending Fangs. This can reduce the cost of this Charm to zero.
