*The prospect of brutality fills the Infernal’s heart with glee.*

The Infernal doubles 9s on a Join Battle roll and adds one die for each nontrivial opponent she’s aware of, maximum (higher of Essence or 3). Once per day, she may gain one Willpower in elation when she wins Join Battle after initiating hostilities herself.

If the Infernal has learned [[Threat-Monitoring Excitement]], she adds bonus dice even for enemies that are concealed from her.
## [[Keys]]
#### Rousing Violence Entertainment (Awareness 3)
The Infernal can use this Charm to make an Awareness roll while asleep, unconscious, or incapacitated, suffering no penalties for doing so. She gains this Charm’s benefits on the roll. She may awaken instantly if she detects a threat, using her roll’s successes for her Join Battle. She can even revive herself from unconsciousness if incapacitated, though she still suffers the effects of incapacitation.
#### Eagerly Anticipated Slaughter (Awareness 4, Essence 2) (+5m)
The Infernal can pay a five-mote surcharge to double 8s. This surcharge is reduced by one mote for each die added by [[Joy in Violence Approach]].
#### Crimson Massacre Grin (Awareness 5, Essence 3, [[#Eagerly Anticipated Slaughter (Awareness 4, Essence 2) (+5m)|Eagerly Anticipated Slaughter]])
When the Infernal uses [[#Eagerly Anticipated Slaughter (Awareness 4, Essence 2) (+5m)|Eagerly Anticipated Slaughter]], she doubles 7s.
