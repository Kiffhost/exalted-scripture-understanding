Crippling injuries are entirely voluntary, as they can significantly change a character's concept. Exalted heal most injuries perfectly.

Once per story, a player whose character has just suffered physical damage may reduce that damage by taking a crippling injury. The character must still take a minimum of 2 [[Health Track|Health Levels]] of lethal damage, unless this would leave him Incapacitated or dead (in which case they instead mark the last health box before Incapacitated). The nature of the crippling injury is determined by the amount of damage reduced.

A character’s [[Health Track#wound penalties]] are doubled for the rest of the scene in which he suffers any crippling injury by negating 3 or more health levels of damage. Accepting a crippling injury is basically accepting debility in the name of either producing an interesting plot hook, or attempting to save a character from death. Storytellers, it’s usually poor form to have enemies immediately finish off a crippled character, though you know the needs of your own story best. See the [[Amputee]], [[Blind]], [[Deaf]], [[Mute]], and [[Sterile]] [[Flaws]] for the permanent effects of crippling injuries.
# 1-2 Health Levels
By negating this much damage, the character suffers maiming that impairs the function of some body part or sense. He might lose half the fingers on one hand, or an eye, or half a foot. 
# 3-4 Health Levels
By negating this much damage, the character loses an entire sense or useful extremity. He might be [[Blind|blinded]] completely, have his tongue cut out, lose a [[Amputee|hand]], or suffer [[Sterile|maiming of his generative organs]]. 
# 5 Health Levels
By negating this much damage, the character [[Amputee|loses a limb]]—most of an arm or a leg, gone.
