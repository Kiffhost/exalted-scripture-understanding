The Exalt may draw the illimitable heat of Creation into her body, momentarily wreathing an attacking fist or leg in flame. This Evocation supplements an unarmed attack, granting (lower of Essence or 3) additional raw damage to withering attacks, and permitting decisive attacks to re-roll up to (lower of Essence or 3) 10s.
