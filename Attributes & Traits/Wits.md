Wits rates a character’s intuition, common sense, and ability to react quickly to new circumstances or while under fire. In combat, Wits is used for the Join Battle roll that determines a character’s starting Initiative, and it also factors into a character’s capacity to remain unmoved by persuasion that goes against his intuitive understanding of the world, contributing to his Resolve rating.
