*Invoking seven torments forbidden by the Old Laws, the Abyssal conjures seven blackfeathered blades from her shadow, which drift and circle around her in anticipation of violence to come.*
The deathknight manifests seven blades, each with a unique effect and cost. Once per round, when she makes an attack, she may reflexively make a second attack using [[Melee]] or [[Thrown]] with one of the Seven Edges by paying its cost. The Seven Edges have artifact knife traits (ACC +5; +10 DMG; +0 DEF; OVW 3; Lethal, [[Melee]], [[Thrown]] [Short]). Attacks with them are always surprise attacks. After making the attack, the blade that she used vanishes.
The Abyssal doesn’t gain that [[Initiative]] from withering damage rolls with the blades. Decisive attacks with them have ([[Essence]] + attack roll 10s), which ignore [[Hardness]]. They don’t use or reset the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]].
Additionally, the attack gains an effect based on the blade used. Some effects only enhance certain kinds of attacks, but the deathknight can still use any of the Seven Edges with both withering and decisive attacks.
The Eager Accomplice (3m; Withering-only): If either attack crashes the target, the deathknight may reflexively make an additional attack with another one of the Seven Edges, waiving its cost.
Fathomless Gluttony (3m, 1wp; Decisive-only): The Abyssal heals one level of non-aggravated damage for each level of decisive damage dealt by Fathomless Gluttony, maximum ([[Essence]]).
Heartache’s [[Needle]] (3m, 1wp; Withering-only) An enemy’s soak is halved against a withering attack with Heartache’s [[Needle]]. If it crashes him, his soak is halved until he recovers from crash.
Perdition’s Chains (3m, 1wp; Decisive-only): The attack receives the benefits of [[Shadow-Pinning Strike]], embedding Perdition’s Chains in the victim’s shadow. It doesn’t vanish until the clinch ends.
This isn’t compatible with [[Soul-Haunting Infiltration]] River of Tears (5m; Uniform): This blade flows around obstructions. Its attacks are unblockable and ignore cover, even full cover. If River of Tears is the last remaining blade, its attack becomes undodgeable as well.
Thorn of Regret (4m; Decisive-only): On a successful decisive attack, this blade’s barbs bite deep into the wound, calling out to its kin. On her next attack against that target, the Abyssal may choose to strike with two of the Seven Edges instead of one. She loses this benefit if she doesn’t attack him by the end of her next turn.
The Weeping Mother (4m; Decisive-only): On a successful decisive attack, the Weeping Mother inflicts a poison of the eyes that inflicts Damage 4i/round, Duration ([[Essence]] + 3) rounds, and a −3 penalty. The venom drips from the victim’s eyes like black ichor, causing its penalty to subtract successes instead of dice from vision-based [[Perception]] and [[Awareness]] rolls.
If the deathknight successfully establishes concealment against all enemies, she may call back one of her expended blades.
