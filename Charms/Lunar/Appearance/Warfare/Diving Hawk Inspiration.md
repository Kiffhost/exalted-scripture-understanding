Hastening into the thick of battle, the Lunar leads her forces into the fray. For each 10 on her Join Battle roll, she can add a success to an allied battle groupâ€™s Join Battle roll. She may divide these successes among multiple battle groups. If she wins Join Battle, she reflexively makes an Appearance-based order action. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a Dexterity Charm, with Cunning Beast-Warrior Reflexes (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
