The Exalt can master the social currents that surround her to gain a greater understanding of the situation. The Solar makes a read intentions action with (Essence) automatic successes, applying a single roll against the Guile of all targets in the scene of whom she is aware. Success reveals surface attitudes, (“She is nervous and impatient about something”), emotions (“He is angry at her”), and Ties (“Those two are besotted with one another”), revealing this information at a glance. The Solar can also discern what her targets want from one another (“He is trying to seduce her; she wants to buy his horse”). This Charm does not read minds—rather, it models the skill of a Lawgiver who can read the thousandfold nuances of social interaction with breathtaking ease. Failing to read a target’s intentions with this Charm does not count as failing a read intentions action for the purposes of a reset. The Solar may only use this Charm once per scene, but she may reuse it if the scene changes significantly in some way.
