*The Sidereal’s shadow rises from the earth, embracing her gently as it splinters into countless thorns of darkness that encircle her hands and limbs.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits
- She ignores penalties for flurrying attacks with movement actions.
- When an enemy takes an action to move into close range or rushes her, her shadow-thorns inflict (Essence, maximum 5) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. Enemies who hit her with unarmed or with natural attacks also suffer this damage. It’s aggravated against the undead. An enemy can only provoke this damage once per round.
- Against the undead, her decisive attacks add (Essence, maximum 5) damage dice.
- She’s immune to magic that affects her shadow.
## Special activation rules
The Sidereal can enter this Form reflexively when she succeeds on a disengage roll with 5+ total successes.
