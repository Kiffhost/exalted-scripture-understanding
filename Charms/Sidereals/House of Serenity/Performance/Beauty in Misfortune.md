*Even as her life crumbles around her, the Sidereal refuses to succumb to despair — how can she, when the world itself calls for an encore?*
The Sidereal benefits as if she’d fulfilled an auspicious prospect (p. 132) when she suffers a noteworthy defeat or setback related to her patron Maiden’s purview. She loses one additional Limit when she does. Examples include:
### Journeys
Getting somewhere too late. Not being able to catch someone or something you’re pursuing.
Suffering significant harm from dangers encountered while traveling.
### Serenity
Struggling with significant troubles in a relationship. Missing an opportunity to win or leverage someone’s positive feelings, obligations, or support for you. An enterprise or organization with which the Sidereal’s involved coming on hard times.
### Battles
Retreating, surrendering, or suffering defeat in combat. Having an audience or public sentiment turned against you. Losing soldiers, significant amounts of materiel, artifact armaments, etc.
### Secrets
Having a secret you were keeping exposed.
Missing an opportunity to learn something or learning something that’s actually inaccurate or detrimental to her. Failure in endeavors involving spirits, sorcery, artifice, geomancy, etc.
### Endings
Missing an opportunity to kill someone or destroy something once you set out to do so. Someone or something the Sidereal is protecting or caring for coming to serious harm. The death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, a betrayal by a friend, etc.
These examples aren’t exhaustive or mutually exclusive — just because something falls under one Maiden’s purview doesn’t mean it can’t also be under another Maiden’s as well.
With a Performance 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay 10 motes, one Willpower once per story when she fulfills an auspicious prospect this way to end a Psyche effect she suffers, finding clarity in failure.
