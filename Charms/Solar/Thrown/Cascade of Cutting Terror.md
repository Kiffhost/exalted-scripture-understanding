Once per combat, the Solar can unleash this attack against a single target, giving her the full dice benefits of having used a full Thrown Excellency. This attack cannot be dodged, only blocked. If successful, the attack is joined by dozens or hundreds of copied weapons, striking points all around the target, doing twice the damage successes to all significant objects and insignificant opponents within short range of the initial strike. If the Exalt wins Join Battle and opens with this attack, she does not need to take an aim action to launch it from medium or long range. The Solar can reset Cascade of Cutting Terror by hurling away her last missile and then recovering at least a single throwing weapon with a stunt.
