The sorcerer transforms her hands into huge, gnarled claws of thorny oak, like those of the majestic elemental dragons of wood. Slashing with these claws uses the traits of a light artifact weapon with the same tags as an unarmed attack, save that its damage tag is lethal rather than bashing. They are compatible with Martial Arts styles that use claw-type weapons or rending strikes, such as Tiger style. They render the sorcerer’s hands incapable of fine manipulation such as writing, wielding a weapon, or turning a doorknob. In addition, characters with an Essence pool gain access to the following powers while this spell is active: 
- Bramble Hell Torment (10m; Simple; Instant; Decisive-only): When the sorcerer makes a decisive savaging attack against a clinched enemy, her claws explode into impaling spikes, adding (Essence) successes to the damage roll. This power can only be used once per grapple. 
- Living Thorn Transformation (3m; Reflexive; Instant): Warping and twisting her claws, the sorcerer may grant them the tag of her choice for the rest of the scene. She might extend them into a lash of scourging brambles to grant them the flexible tag, reshape them into a bludgeoning club-fists to grant them the smashing tag, or similar. Only one tag can be granted by this power at a time. A sorcerer who knows Wood Dragon’s Claws as her control spell may create and master Evocations for the claws, which can only be used while this spell is active. 
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 12)
Distorting the Wood Dragon’s Claws causes them to begin growing wildly, engulfing the enemy sorcerer’s arms in a tangle of twisting roots. He cannot take any actions that require the use of his arms, including attacking, until he has succeeded on an extended (Strength + Athletics) roll (difficulty: 2; interval: one round; goal number: 10) to break free of this entanglement. If he is grappling an enemy when the distortion occurs, the distraction of his own spell turning on him allows that character to reflexively break free. The spell cannot be dismissed while it is distorted.
