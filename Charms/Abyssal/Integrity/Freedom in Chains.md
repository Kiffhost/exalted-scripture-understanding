*The deathknight has sworn an oath to the Neverborn that can never be unspoken. No lesser binding can truly hold her.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm to break free of Psyche effects, possession, or any other magic that exerts control over her body, mind, or soul. Before she can do so, she must first be forced to act against one of her Intimacies or against death’s chivalry by it. After a scene spent contemplating or brooding over these events, she can use this Charm to break free of that effect’s control.
## Reset 
Once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal in a way that upholds death’s chivalry.
