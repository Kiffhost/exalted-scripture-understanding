Winding her mind through eternity’s gyre, the stylist remembers that which is yet to come, The stylist can use this Charm when she would be disadvantaged due to a surprising event or something she hasn’t noticed: facing a surprise attacking, failing an Awareness roll to notice a trap, a thief sneaking past her bedchamber while she’s asleep, etc. It can be used against ambushes, though this doesn’t let her use other magic to enhance the roll. The stylist rolls (Intelligence + Lore) against an enemy’s opposed roll or a peril’s difficulty adding a free full Excellency. If successful, she foresees — or rather, remembers — this eventuality in time to defend against it as though she’d noticed the threat in advance. Against attacks, this counts as a clash. This Charm can also be used against threats that are more narrative in nature than an attack or trap or that would disadvantage the stylist even if she succeeds on her roll or doesn’t get a chance to roll. The stylist rolls as above, opposing an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll by the relevant character — or the character with the highest such pool, if there are multiple characters. If successful, her player may reveal a preparation she’s taken for this, which must be something she could have feasibly done in the last few minutes with the materials available to her. She might reveal’s she’s awoken everyone in her camp just before a midnight raid by bandits, or that she’s wearing armor under her clothes in anticipation of a trusted friend’s betrayal.
