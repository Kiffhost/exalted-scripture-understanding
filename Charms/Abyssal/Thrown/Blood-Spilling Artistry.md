*The deathknight’s blades paint the battlefield crimson as she conducts a symphony of screams.*
What other artist could compare? The Abyssal adds up to ([[Appearance]], [[Charisma]], or [[Manipulation]]) 10s on her attack roll as dice of decisive damage, maximum, (highest Social Attribute) dice. On a surprise attack, each 10 adds two damage dice.
If the Abyssal’s attack incapacitates a nontrivial foe, enemies and bystanders who witnessed it are instilled with a Tie of fear toward her if their [[Resolve]] is lower than the total damage dealt. With an appropriate stunt, the deathknight can instill positive Ties with contexts like awe, respect, or infatuation.
