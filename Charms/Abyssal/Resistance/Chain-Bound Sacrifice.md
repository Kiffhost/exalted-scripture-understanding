*Those caught in the Abyssalâ€™s chains make for excellent, if unwilling, bodyguards.*
While grappling an enemy with [[Chain-and-Armor Mortification]], the Abyssal can use him as a shield to clash a decisive attack. She rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]), doubling 9s and adding automatic successes equal to her rounds of control. If she wins the clash, the attack is redirected to the grappled enemy and automatically hits him.
