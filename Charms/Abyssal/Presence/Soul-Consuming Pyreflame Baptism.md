*Death’s Lawgiver fills her apostles’ hearts with sickly green pyreflame, granting them unholy power even as it burns away their souls.*
The Abyssal anoints a willing mortal or [[Essence]] 1 ghost as a pyreflame apostle. They gain dark blessings, described below, but at a steep cost. Each time they use a blessing, they must pay one level of aggravated damage. If they have any positive Intimacies, they must also weaken one of them by one step.
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses two of the following blessings to grant her apostles. She can purchase additional blessings for three experience or one bonus point each.
Blazing Martyr Conviction (Reflexive; One scene): The apostle ignores wound penalties and heat- or flame-based environmental penalties. He adds (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3) soak against flamebased attacks, and gains that much [[Hardness]] against them.
Immolating Hatred Halo (Simple; Instant): The apostle is wreathed in a corona of pyreflame that extends out to close range, a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty of (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3) and, Damage 3L.
Kindled in Darkness (Reflexive; Instant): While acting in accordance with death’s chivalry or one of his or the Abyssal’s negative Defining Intimacies, the apostle can use this blessing after a roll, rolling three additional non-Charm dice. This blessing can also be used after a roll against one of his static values, adding the successes from these dice to that value.
Prophet of Despair (Supplemental; Instant): The apostle doubles 8s and ignores multiple target penalties on an influence roll to instill or leverage a negative [[Intimacy]].
Soul-Scorching Wrath (Reflexive; One scene): The apostle can unleash pyreflame on her foes, treating it as a medium artifact weapon with the [[Archery]] (Long), Lethal, Flame, and One-Handed tags.
The Abyssal’s player can work with the [[Storyteller]] to design new blessings.
An apostle who damages his last −4 health level using a blessing is consumed utterly at the end of their scene. His soul is burnt away, preventing the living from leaving ghosts and destroying ghosts utterly. An apostle who damages his Incapacitated level using a blessing can complete his actions for that tick, after which he suffers the same fate. This Charm’s experience point is refunded if the apostle dies or ceases to be narratively relevant.
An Abyssal may have up to ([[Essence]] x2) apostles at a time.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal may purchase the Whispering Nightmare Flame blessing, permanently granting her apostles gain two-dot [[Whispers]]. This doesn’t have the usual cost of this Charm’s blessings.
