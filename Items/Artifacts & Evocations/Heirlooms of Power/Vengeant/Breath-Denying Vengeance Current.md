The wielder inundates her victim with Vengeant’s sluggish, hateful essence, filling his lungs with black bile. This is a gambit whose difficulty is (higher of target’s Essence or Stamina). Success causes the victim to begin asphyxiating (Exalted, p. 232). He may attempt to clear the obstruction with a (Stamina + Resistance) roll as a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried. A single success is sufficient for that round not to count against the total he can hold his breath, while overcoming a difficulty of (wielder’s Essence) purges the obstruction entirely. With a stunt, a character may roll a different dice pool, such as (Wits + Medicine), to clear the obstruction. 

## Resonant

Against a despised opponent, each threshold success on the gambit’s Initiative roll adds one bonus die on her rolls to oppose his disengage actions until he’s cleared the obstruction.
