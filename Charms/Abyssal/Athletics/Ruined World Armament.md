*Steel gates and stone walls are no guarantee of safety against the deathknight; before her awful strength, they are yet another weapon.*
The Abyssal gains the following benefits when fighting with improvised weapons:
 - She waives the [[Initiative]] cost to attack with them.
 - They gain +1 [[Accuracy]].
 - They add +(Essence/2, rounded up) to their damage and Overwhelming.
 - Medium and heavy weapons gain the Smashing tag. If they already had it, the deathknight waives the [[Initiative]] cost and [[Defense]] penalty for making smash attacks.
