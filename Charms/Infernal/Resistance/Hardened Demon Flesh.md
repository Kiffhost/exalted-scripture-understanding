*The Infernal is tempered by the torments she has borne, her body purged of human frailty.*

The Infernal gains additional health levels based on her Stamina rating:
- **Stamina 1-2**: One −1 level and one −2 level.
- **Stamina 3-4**: One −2 level and three −4 levels.
- **Stamina 5**: Two −2 levels and two −4 levels.

This Charm may be purchased (Resistance) times. If the Infernal’s Stamina increases, her health levels change to reflect her new rating.
## [[Keys]]
#### Immortal Fiend Invigoration (Resistance 2)
The Infernal multiplies the rate at which she heals by (Essence + Stamina + purchases of [[Hardened Demon Flesh]]). Her wounds seem strange and unsettling as they heal, flushed with unnatural colours or scabbing over with verdigrised brass.
