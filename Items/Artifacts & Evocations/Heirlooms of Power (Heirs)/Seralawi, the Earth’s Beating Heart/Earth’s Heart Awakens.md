*Seralawi recalls countless battles, empowering its master to take her place in the armor’s legend.*
To use this Evocation, the wearer must be hit by a withering or decisive attack from a nontrivial opponent without taking any damage. She rolls [[Join Battle]] with ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). Each 10 on the roll increases Seralawi’s soak by +1 for the scene.
This Evocation can only be used once per scene.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wearer is hit by a withering or decisive attack from a nontrivial opponent without taking any damage.
## Resonant
The wielder can use this Evocation when her soak reduces a nontrivial opponent’s withering attack to minimum damage.
