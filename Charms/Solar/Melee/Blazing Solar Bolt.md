*The Lawgiver hones the force of he rjudgment into a lambent charge of pure Solar power, and raises her weapon to strike.*
A powerful stream of energy leaps between her weapon and her Caste Mark and is unleashed by her attack, flying through the air to lance through her opponent. This attack is made with the Solar’s (Dexterity+Melee), and does lethal decisive damage with a base damage of ([[Essence]] + extra successes on the attack). [[Blazing Solar Bolt]] can strike an opponent from short range, ignores hardness, and cannot be dodged or blocked without a Charm. In addition, the Charm’s range can be increased by spending anima levels at a rate of one level per increase, allowing the Solar to strike opponents four range bands distant. Against residents of Malfeas or the Underworld and other creatures of darkness, this Charm gains the Aggravated keyword. Damage done by this attack does not include the Solar’s [[Initiative]] and does not return her to base [[Initiative]] upon success. 

## Special activation rules

[[Blazing Solar Bolt]] can only be used once per combat, but can be reset by landing a decisive attack with 7+ [[Initiative]] and then building [[Initiative]] to 12+.
