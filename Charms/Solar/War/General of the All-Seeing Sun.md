Poring over maps and strategies real and remembered, the Solar sees perfect stillness beneath the chaotic [[Essence]] of combat. This Charm supplements the Strategic Maneuver roll, adding one automatic success plus ([[Essence]]) dice. In addition, the Exalt may choose to split her successes into multiple stratagems. The Solar may deploy no more stratagems than her [[Essence]] rating.
