Through diligence, effort, and connectedness to the [[Essence]] of her art, the Solar learns to adapt the unfathomable least wonders of the cosmos to the trades which she has mastered. By using this Charm before she begins a superior project to build a two-dot [[Artifact]], she can place that project in an unused major slot. Motes committed to this Charm remain committed until the project is finished. If she relinquishes commitment, she must create a superior slot to carry the unfinished artifact, or otherwise risk a catastrophic failure of the project. At [[Essence]] 5+, she may use this Charm to craft three dot Artifacts.
