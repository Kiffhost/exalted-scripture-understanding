*Flowing from one identity to another, the Dragon-Blood reflects the desires and expectations of those around her.*
She rolls read intentions with ([[Perception]] + [[Larceny]]). Success reveals the identity of an individual her target has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards that the Dragon-Blood knows well enough to attempt to disguise herself as, as well as the nature of the [[Intimacy]]. If no such individual exists, she learns that instead. In Water Aura, the Exalt doubles 9s on the roll.
