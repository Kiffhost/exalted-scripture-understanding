*Few can see the chains that bind them to their suffering, but the bleak saint’s parables open their eyes.*
The stylist makes a difficulty 2 [[Attack#Gambit|gambit]] to bind an enemy with a fetter of spectral [[Essence]], manifesting the strongest [[Intimacy]] her victim has that gives him a reason to go on living. If multiple Intimacies are tied, his player chooses.
If successful, the gambit chains the victim with the affected [[Intimacy]]:
 - He increases his mobility penalty by −1, or −2 for a Major or Defining Intimacy.
 - He must always roll to rise from prone (Exalted, p. 197), and his [[mobility penalty]] subtracts successes instead of dice when he does.
 - At the end of each of his turns, he loses one Initiative unless he took a [[full defense]]. If he’s [[prone]], he loses two [[Initiative]].
 - While the Intimacy remains manifested, it’s vulnerable to physical harm. The stylist and her allies can strike it as a gambit against the fettered enemy, with difficulty (Intimacy + 2). If successful, the Intimacy is weakened by one step unless the victim pays one [[Willpower]] and five Initiative to resist.
If the stylist rolls 2+ extra successes on the gambit’s Initiative roll, the weight of her victim’s fetters also drops him prone.
## Enlightenment
The stylist may make a damaging decisive attack instead of a gambit, binding her foe if she deals 2+ levels of damage and knocking him prone with 4+ damage.
