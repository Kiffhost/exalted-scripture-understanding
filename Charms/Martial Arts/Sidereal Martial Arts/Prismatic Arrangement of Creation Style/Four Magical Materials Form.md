The martial artist’s stance, breathing, footwork, and Essence embody the magical materials, transforming her into a living artifact. The stylist gains the following benefits: 
-  Her unarmed attacks gain artifact traits (Accuracy +5, Damage +10B/3). 
-  She reduces the cost of this Charm’s prerequisites by two motes. 
-  She’s immune to crippling effects and ignores crippling penalties. 
-  She can use Evocations she’s awakened from a jade, orichalcum, moonsilver, or starmetal artifacts without needing that artifact, letting her use weapon Evocations through unarmed attacks. She can’t use Evocations whose effect requires the artifact. Enlightenment: The stylist becomes resonant with jade, moonsilver, orichalcum, and starmetal. 

## Special activation rules

The stylist can reflexively enter this Form when she uses all four of its prerequisite Charms in a round. Other Magical Materials This style has no Charm for soulsteel, but the potential exists. Sidereals lack the affinity for death’s Essence necessary to create such a Charm themselves, but a Sidereal who’s learned all this style’s Charms could do so with an Abyssal’s aid, as could an Abyssal who’s mastered this style. Similarly, a Sidereal would need the aid of a character who’s resonant with adamant, like an Adamant Caste Alchemical, to create a Charm for Adamant. In Four Magical Materials Form, such Charms would receive its discount and the stylist could use Evocations of weapons made from their materials. With Enlightenment, she’d gain resonance with them.
