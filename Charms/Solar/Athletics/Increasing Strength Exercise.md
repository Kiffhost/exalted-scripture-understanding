The Solar draws remarkable strength from deep within her core. For every three motes of Essence or Initiative the Exalt spends, her Strength score increases by one. Each dot of increase also raises the base damage of her decisive attacks by one. The Solarâ€™s Strength cannot be increased by more than her Essence rating through use of this Charm, and this Charm may not grant her more than double her Strength score. Through use of Increasing Strength Exercise, Solars can reach the Strength minimums required to attempt certain feats of strength (p. 229).
