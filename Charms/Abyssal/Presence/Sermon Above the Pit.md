*To hear the Abyssal’s words is to hear the distant howl of the end, the soft crumbling of bones into dust — and dust into nothing at all.*
When the Abyssal makes an [[instill]] or [[persuade]] roll that leverages a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] or a [[Intimacy|Principle]] that reflects a positive outlook on death, it also counts as an [[instill]] roll to create a related [[Intimacy]]. This fails if the target has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that directly opposes the instilled [[Intimacy]].
With a [[Socialize]] 5 repurchase, this Charm can enhance rolls that are opposed by positive [[Intimacy|Tie]]s or [[Intimacy|Principle]]s that reflect a negative outlook on death, letting the Abyssal create Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] opposed to that [[Intimacy]]. The target is immune to this only if he has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] other than the one used to oppose the influence that opposes the instilled [[Intimacy]].
