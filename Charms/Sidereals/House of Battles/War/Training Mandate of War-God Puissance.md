The Sidereal’s esoteric training regimen cultivates the unrealized potential of Essence, elevating gods to wrathful guardians and honing the legends of Exalted heroes. The Sidereal teaches another character a spell or Martial Arts Charm (including Sidereal Martial Arts) she knows, letting him go into experience debt (p. XX) to learn it. Alternatively, by drilling him in the use of an artifact weapon or armor, she may let him awaken one of its Evocations. Fellow Sidereals can be taught any Sidereal Charm she knows, while spirits can be taught spirit Charms appropriate to their purview through Essence-cultivating regimens. The training time needed to learn this power is divided by (Sidereal’s Essence + Intelligence). The Sidereal’s student must meet the prerequisites of any powers learned this way.
