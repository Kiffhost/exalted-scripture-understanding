Reciting the seven vows that Venus once swore to an unknown paramour, the Sidereal binds herself and a puissant companion together with her sacred oath. The Sidereal can gain Eclipse Charms from a willing character by swearing a formal pact with him, committing three motes per Charm. She may have up to (Essence) Eclipse Charms from this Charm at a time, either through a single use or multiple stacked activations. She can also use this Charm if she completes a serious or life-changing task (Exalted, p. 216) at a character’s request, considering her performance of the task as his implicit consent to the pact. The Sidereal may permanently learn these Eclipse Charms accessed for eight experience points each. She no longer needs to commit motes to use them and they don’t count toward the maximum of (Essence). She waives the experience point cost of the first Eclipse Charm purchased this way.
