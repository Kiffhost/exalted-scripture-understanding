*Taking up a musical instrument, the Exalt pours her [[Essence]] through her fingers as she plays, evoking the soul of a composition.*
This Charm supports social influence being employed by other characters in the scene. The player names a mood which the song should induce, with an intended effect. It can be a calming song to prevent hostility, a market song to induce trade, a romantic song to aid in seduction, and so on. After the player has named the effect of the song, the Storyteller can decide how it affects the scene, adding or subtracting bonus dice equal to the Solar’s [[Essence]]. For example, a song with a calming influence will penalize social influence that attempts to provoke anger, while romantic music enhances sexual persuasion. This Charm enhances and penalizes the social influence of anyone who can hear it. The Solar’s music can also instead be tailored to enhance a dance or a song sung by a specific character.
