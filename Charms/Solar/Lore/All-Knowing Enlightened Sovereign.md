By expanding her mind, the Lawgiver can consult an Essencethattouchestheendsoftheuniversetofindtheanswer. This Charm allows the Solar to attempt to challenge a Lore difficulty that is outside the background reflected by her Lore rating. With especially difficult challenges, such a roll is not even possible, but the Lawgiver may challenge any difficulty and any topic with her Lore by using this Charm. This Charm confers no knowledge of the required difficulty, though the Solar becomes aware of the topic the moment she uses this Charm, if she doesnâ€™t know already. This Charm can be used once per story, but can be reset by a scene in which the Solar spends time studying the Lore topic she last challenged with this Charm.
