Coming to an accommodation with her enemy’s killing intent, the Sidereal strikes an instant before he can. The Sidereal reflexively clashes an attack with a decisive attack. If she succeeds against an enemy’s decisive attack, she gains the Initiative he loses for missing, adding them to her damage roll.
