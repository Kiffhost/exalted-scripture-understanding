The Solar marks her target and strikes with deadly purpose. If her attack does at least three damage, it adds a -3 penalty to all of her opponentâ€™s dice pools for the rest of the scene. This can be portrayed as a stunning blow to the head, a scratched eye, injured hand, or other similar injuries. Any particular wounding does not automatically heal at the end of the scene; the target may need special care to restore lost sight or use of a hand suffering nerve damage.
