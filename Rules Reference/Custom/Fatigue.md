Fatigue may represent the trembling of tired muscles, the wandering concentration of an air-starved mind or the difficulties of eloquence when panting and sweating. 
It may also cover the malaise, stiffness and befuddlement of sleep-deprivation.
It is distinct from [[Deprivation]] due to hunger, thirst or a lack of breathable air.
## Sources of fatigue
Magical effects Charms occasionally apply fatigue penalties to their targets, sapping their energies or willpower. These are not the focus of this #custom/rule, rather, this rule seeks to account for the mundane and practical form of fatigue.
Nonetheless, all fatigue penalties from any number of magical or natural sources are considered to be stacking.
# Exalted
Constant exertion can takes its toll on even the mighty Exalted. After ([[Stamina]] + {[[Resistance]] or [[Athletics]]}) minutes of strenuous activity—such as combat or hard running—the storyteller may apply a -1 fatigue penalty to all actions, with this penalty getting more severe each minute after that. 
Penalties gained this way improve by 1 for every round spent resting.
Separately and in addition, should an exalt fail to sleep or take an extended rest for one full day and night, they may suffer a -1 fatigue penalty to their actions in addition to their forgoing their nightly [[Willpower#Gaining Willpower|Willpower]]. Subsequent day-night cycles without sleep will increase this penalty, though in most cases a full night of rest will clear it entirely.
At the storytellers discretion, half the value of sleep-fatigue may apply to static value traits such as [[Guile]], [[Resolve]] and [[Defense]].
# Mortals
Without Essence to invigorate them, most mortals tire and weaken much more quickly than Chosen. After ([[Stamina]] + {[[Resistance]] or [[Athletics]]})/2 minutes of strenuous activity, the storyteller may apply a -1 fatigue penalty to all actions, with this penalty getting more severe each minute after that.
Penalties gained this way improve by 1 for every minute spent resting.
Lack of sleep is similarly more problematic, after a full day and night without sleep or adequate rest, a mortal may suffer a -1 fatigue penalty to their actions in addition to their forgoing their nightly [[Willpower#Gaining Willpower|Willpower]]. This penalty increases every 12 hours without rest. 
Mortals usually reduce their sleep-fatigue by 2 for every full 12 hours of rest, though they may only be able to do this once per day-night cycle.
Should this penalty exceed the mortals ([[Stamina]]), they may find themselves dosing off without warning whenever they are not actively stimulated. At the Storytellers discretion, they must roll a ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) test against a difficulty equal to their sleep-fatigue penalty to avoid falling asleep in any non-combat scene.
At the storytellers discretion, half the value of sleep-fatigue may apply to static value traits such as [[Guile]], [[Resolve]] and [[Defense]].
# Other Beings
Most ordinary and supernatural animals in Creation suffer fatigue at a similar rate to [[#Mortals]], though they may sleep at a different time of day.
Spirits such as Gods and Elementals lack muscles to tire, and often do not strictly require sleep or rest, though many enter convalescence or contemplation on their own schedules.
Similarly, Ghosts need not rest, though their sense-memories of exhaustion and tiredness may grant them a facsimile of their living weaknesses at the Storyteller's discretion.
Fair Folk (and Demons) are beyond description in these ways, and may follow an entirely different set of rules in the Wyld or Malfeas. Perhaps a Raksha noble fighting in Creation would be fascinated by the first drop of sweat that fell from its brow, while a First Circle Demon might torment its chosen victim unceasingly for days on end.
