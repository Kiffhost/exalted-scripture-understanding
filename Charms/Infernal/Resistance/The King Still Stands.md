*The Infernal falls, almost to a knee, but stops herself. Her skin splits with emerald and crimson-tinged cracks as the earth beneath her trembles for miles around, her eyes shining with all the furies there ever were.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she’s incapacitated or would suffer death for any reason. Any damage that would fill her Incapacitated health level is negated, as are other fatal effects. She can enter her [[Devil-Body]] without it counting against the once-per-story limit, and can do so even if it currently needs to be reset.
## Reset
Once per story.
