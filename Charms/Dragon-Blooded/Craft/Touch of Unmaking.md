*Tracing her fingers over an object’s surface, the Dragon-Blood discerns its weakest point.*
After using [[Flaw-Finding Examination]] on an object, she may use this Charm to supplement a feat of demolition, adding (an applicable Craft/2, round up) to her effective [[Strength]] rating to determine if she may attempt the feat (Exalted, p. 229). If this would raise her above the feat’s [[Strength]] minimum, any excess points are instead added as non-Charm dice on her roll.
