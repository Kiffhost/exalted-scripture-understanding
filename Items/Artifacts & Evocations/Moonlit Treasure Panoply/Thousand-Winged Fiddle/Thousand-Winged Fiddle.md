The [[Thousand-Winged Fiddle]] owes its origins to Haparin Two-Shadow’s slight of Shalbah, a story that’s become legend within the Silver Pact. The two shahan-yas met at a council of the Pact’s Southern elders.
As the assembled shahan-yas retired from their first day of deliberations to feast and revel, Haparin grew intemperate with dream root and wine. When she began her drunken mockery of Shalbah, he laughed it off, even applauding her better barbs. But when she spoke ill of his spirit shape, the grasshopper, even his famous good humor faltered.
In the days thereafter, Shalbah dedicated himself to crafting the [[Thousand-Winged Fiddle]], the instrument of Haparin’s comeuppance. He fashioned its body and bow from the chitin of Locust Avatar’s carapace, freely given when Shalbah told the grasshopper-spirit of Haparin’s slander. Its strings, pegs, and bowstring were of moonsilver; its bridge was carved from demon-bone.
Its timbre is not that of any viol, but of the stridulation of grasshoppers.
For seven days and seven nights, Shalbah played his fiddle without pause as he traveled Haparin’s dominion.
For seven days and seven nights, swarming locusts ravaged its fields. Haparin sought out Shalbah to end his chaos by force — but Shalbah was a master of Nightingale style. In his hands, the fiddle was a weapon as mighty as any daiklave. Seeing no other choice, Haparin finally relented and apologized.
The [[Thousand-Winged Fiddle]] passed through the hands of many of Shalbah’s adherents in the decades thereafter, and even some of Haparin’s. For a time, it was lost to the great demon Erembour. It only returned to the Silver Pact when the shaman Dekallion bargained with the demon, paying a price that he never revealed. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the [[Thousand-Winged Fiddle]]

The Thousand-Winged Fiddle’s [[Evocations]] give its wielder the power to command and communicate with insects through its music, enhancing many Lunar [[Charms]] that do so. It can also be used as a weapon for Silver-Voiced Nightingale style (Exalted, p. 447).
The fiddle is an exceptional instrument (Exalted, p.
580). Its bonus die is converted to an automatic success against insects and insect-like beings. Upon attuning to it, the wielder awakens [[Cadence of the Locust]] for free.
