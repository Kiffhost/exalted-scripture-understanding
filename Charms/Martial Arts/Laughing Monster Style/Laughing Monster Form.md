Adopting a constantly shifting stance of revolving limbs and confused orientation, the stylist seems wreathed with a dozen illusory arms. These add (Occult) dice on counterattacks and on disarm and distract gambits. When successfully dodging an attack causes an attacker at close range to lose Initiative, she can make a decisive counterattack that deals dice of lethal damage equal to the Initiative lost, ignoring Hardness. This doesn’t include or reset her Initiative. Alternatively, she can counterattack with a disarm or distract gambit, using her Initiative as normal, and adding dice on the Initiative roll equal to her attacker’s lost Initiative. 
## Terrestrial

The stylist must pay two Initiative to make a counterattack. 

## Special activation rules

When the stylist provokes a nontrivial opponent into rolling Join Battle against her with an influence roll, or causes an enemy’s Initiative to fall below her own by dodging his attack, she may reflexively enter this Form.
