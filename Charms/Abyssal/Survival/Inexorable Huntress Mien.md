*No matter how desperately her prey runs, he cannot elude the looming shadow of terror that is an Abyssal hunter.*
The Abyssal rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on a tracking roll and adds (quarry’s wound penalty + 1) bonus dice. This Charm can contest magic that perfectly conceals tracks.
With a Survival 5, Essence 2 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a two-mote surcharge to reroll 5s as well as 6s and convert the added dice to automatic successes. If she succeeds, her quarry experiences a chilling premonition of her approach that inflicts a −2 penalty on his Survival and Stealth rolls for the rest of the day.
