  - influence rolls

The core of the [[social influence]] system is the [[influence]] roll. The dice pool for an influence roll is always #attribute/social + #Ability (usually #Ability/influence) against a difficulty of the [[Resolve]] rating of the character you’re trying to influence. 

Successful influence rolls allow you to alter a character’s feelings or beliefs or to convince him to do something for you, based on the [[#Social Actions|social action]] or Charm used. Occasionally, you will use other Attributes and Abilities to take actions that are not influence rolls, such as rolling (Perception + Socialize) to read a person’s personality, beliefs, or agenda. All of these social actions are described in more detail below.
# Resisting
The base difficulty for an [[#Influence roll]] is always the [[Resolve]] rating of the character targeted by the roll, with the chosen action succeeding or failing with the roll. However, in some cases there are further considerations before the action is fully resolved. See also the
## Spending Willpower
Even if a character’s [[Resolve]] is overcome, he may still have an opportunity to deny the influence. If the influence is trying to change how he feels, such as by creating, destroying, or changing his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he may spend a point of [[Willpower]] to: 
- Stop a new Intimacy from being created. Although the character is moved, he just can’t afford to invest himself in a new person or cause! 
- Stop a Major or Defining Intimacy from being weakened. Even though the influence was convincing, the character just has too much invested in the Intimacy to give up now, even if he wants to! 
- Reject a successful inspire action—the character uses his force of will to deny his swelling passions.
## Decision Points
Refusing successful [[Social Influence|influence]] to make the character *do something* (usually [[Persuade]], [[Bargain]] or [[Threaten]]) is trickier. When a character fails to resist such influence with his [[Resolve]], he enters into a special state called a Decision Point.

In the Decision Point, the player must choose an [[Intimacy]] and explain how it justifies resisting that specific influence. The intimacy chosen must fulfil the following requirements: 
- The Intimacy he chooses must be of equal or greater intensity than the Intimacy which supported the influence roll.
- It can’t be the one that strengthened his Resolve against the roll in the first place—the influence already overcame that particular source of reluctance when it beat his Resolve, after all. 
- The Storyteller must accept the player’s argument for why one of his Intimacies would make him reject the influence.
If those requirements are met, then the character may spend 1 Willpower point to resist the influence roll. Otherwise, resistance is impossible.

<summary>Example Decision Point</summary>
As an example Decision Point, consider Son of Wolves, a Zenith Caste whose Resolve rating has just been overcome by the influence roll of Naya, a scheming Sidereal. The Sidereal seeks to turn him against his Circle (a serious task), and her [[persuade]] action is supported by Son of Wolves’s Major [[Intimacy#Principle|Principle]] of belief in the Immaculate Faith, which manifests as a lingering and unshakable conviction that he and his fellow Solar Exalted are Anathema. Unless Son of Wolves can match this with an Intimacy of Major or Defining intensity, he will be powerless to defy the truth he hears in Naya’s words. While he has a Defining Tie of loyalty towards his Circlemates, he already used that Intimacy to bolster his Resolve, rendering it unavailable in a Decision Point. Luckily, he also has a Major Principle of “I can’t abide a traitor,” owing back to a terrible betrayal he suffered long ago. His player argues that this allows him not to betray his Circlemates even if they are Anathema. The Storyteller accepts this argument, and Son of Wolves is able to spend a point of Willpower to resist.

### Lengthy Debates
Sometimes after a character has spent [[Willpower]] in a [[#Decision Points|Decision Point]] in order to reject influence, the initiate will return with a new or stronger argument. When this happens, the initiate is engaging the [[#Retrying Social Actions|reset rules for social actions]]. If the same issue is being argued as a result, the target may not use an [[Intimacy]] which boosted his [[Resolve]] against the initial roll. After all, that logic was not enough to stop him from being forced into the Decision Point in the first place. 

To boost his Resolve against the initiate’s second attempt, he must find another Intimacy to raise his Resolve—or use the one that allowed him to reject influence in the Decision Point. Remember that the Intimacy a character uses to raise his Resolve cannot be invoked in a Decision Point. This rule continues to apply throughout the story—as long as the initiate can find new angles with which to demonstrate the rightness of her persuasion, she can cause her target to use up all of his valid excuses over the course of a story. When a character has no valid Intimacies with which to enter a Decision Point, beating his Resolve will finally convince him to agree with the initiate’s arguments. Thus a prophet may soften the heart of a prince over time.
## Unacceptable Influence
There are limits on what can be achieved with social influence. No amount of charisma is sufficient to talk someone into suicide, or to convince a die-hard patriot to betray his cause. If a request is so antithetical to the nature and personality of its target that it cannot possibly succeed, it is said to be *unacceptable influence*. 

A character targeted by unacceptable influence may reject it outright without spending [[Willpower]], even if his [[Resolve]] would not normally be high enough to defend against it. A player can still choose to have his character follow the course of action put forward by unacceptable influence, but only because he thinks it makes sense—the character cannot be coerced into doing it. Some powerful Charms and spells can also compel characters into bowing to unacceptable influence.

Unacceptable influence includes: 
- Any [[instill]] action to strengthen or weaken an Intimacy which doesn’t exploit an appropriately strong Intimacy to do so.
<details><summary>Example</summary>
A Deathlord’s agent sits down next to a Solar in a teahouse and intimates that the Solar’s Lunar companion is not to be trusted, but she gives no reasons—only dim intimations. The Solar has a Major Tie of trust toward the Lunar. Because the Abyssal exploits no Intimacies to support her suggestions, the Solar can ignore her attempt at weakening his Intimacy toward the Lunar.

- Any [[Persuade|persuasion]] attempt which doesn't exploit an Intimacy strong enough to support the proposed task.
<details><summary>Example</summary>
A zealous Immaculate missionary attempts to convince the high priestess of Hamoji, great volcano god of the Wavecrest Archipelago, to abandon her life of worship. This would be a life-changing task, and the priestess has no Defining Intimacies which would support the missionary’s exhortations. As such, the priestess is free to reject the proposed influence at no cost, without the need of a Decision Point.

- Any [[bargain]] attempt which fails to offer a properly enticing incentive or threaten action which is insufficiently threatening. 
- Any influence that would cause a character to kill himself, or to do something that he knows would result in his certain death. 
- Any influence that would cause a character to completely abandon or end one of his Defining Intimacies is unacceptable. 
<details>A farmer with a Defining Tie of love to his wife might be seduced by another person, but could not be convinced to abandon or murder his wife. A Solar with a Defining Principle of “I will win the allegiance of the sorceress Raksi” could not be convinced to kill her, as this would make fulfilling that goal impossible. Weakening a Defining Intimacy is still allowed, making it possible to first degrade an Intimacy from Defining to Major and then issue the otherwise unacceptable influence

- Any seduction attempt that violates a character’s sexual orientation (as defined by the player, or by the Storyteller in the case of Storyteller characters) is unacceptable.
- Certain Charms allow characters to define special kinds of influence that they may treat as unacceptable.
