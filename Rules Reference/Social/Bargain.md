Bargaining is similar to the [[persuade]] action, but doesn’t depend on your target’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. Instead, you must offer a bribe, gift, or favor that the character you’re convincing believes is worth the difficulty or danger of the task you’re asking him to perform. The Storyteller should take into account the Intimacies, wealth, and social status of the character in deciding what they will consider sufficient payment (a wealthy noble is not going to be moved to favor your cause in court by the gift of an apple, though a starving beggar might be).
# Retry
You can only retry a failed bargain roll by making a new offering that’s substantially greater than your previous one.

If a peasant is unswayed by a gift equivalent to a day’s wage, then perhaps he will listen to a week’s or month’s pay. A courtier who rejects an offer of marriage to a minor noble might be convinced by a wedding contract with a young Dragon-Blood.
