*The necromancer’s voice echoes with an invitation to the Vagrant Precincts, a fragment of the Labyrinth that takes special delight in its own twisting infinities.*
The necromancer enchants a building she is inside or can perceive within ([[Essence]]) miles, twisting its architecture into grotesquery and turning its interiors into a perilous maze. Characters attempting to navigate or escape the structure must make an extended roll, with difficulty (necromancer’s [[Essence]]) and goal number (necromancer’s [[Willpower]] x2). Each interval requires a few minutes of trial and error, usually with ([[Wits]] + {[[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], or [[Survival]]}). Storytellers may allow other Abilities with a stunt, such as [[Brawl]] to punch through walls with brute force or [[Lore]] to reason out the maze’s impossible geometry.
Failed rolls deliver characters into difficult or dangerous circumstances, blocking their way forward with walls of pyreflame, groups of war ghosts, or similar perils. Characters must make individual rolls to escape as the halls seek to separate groups; leading others by hand levies a −2 penalty that may be waived by magic that allows a character to lead others through dangerous terrain such as [[Trackless Region Navigation]] (Exalted, p. 409).
This spell always leaves unpredictable aftereffects on a building once-enchanted by it — an door that never leads where it should, wandering floors, and so on.
## Control
Rolls to escape without magic suffer a −2 penalty. While the necromancer is within ([[Essence]]) miles, she can automatically intuit who is trapped inside and how close they are to escape. For five motes, she may project her senses and appearance to any point within the maze to observe, taunt, or bargain with her victims. Doors, paths, and stairs seem to momentarily warp and skew as she passes.
## Distortion (9)
A rival necromancer can bend the Vagrant Precincts to take pity on him. He reduces the difficult of each roll by (his Essence/2, rounded up) and can lead others without any penalty.
