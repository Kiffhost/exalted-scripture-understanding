Firewands are one-shot flamethrowers powered by firedust, a substance found naturally occurring deep in the Southern deserts or synthesized from a variety of exotic reagents found elsewhere in that Direction. Made from finely turned brass with wooden or metal stocks, firewands are prized by any soldier lucky enough to own one. Firedust must be loaded down the front of the barrel, and the weapon can hold only a single shot. While readily available in the South, firedust can be expensive and difficult to find elsewhere (Resources • in the South, •• or higher elsewhere). Many soldiers fit bayonets on the ends of their firewands and use them as spears once the weapon has been fired (treat as a short spear).
