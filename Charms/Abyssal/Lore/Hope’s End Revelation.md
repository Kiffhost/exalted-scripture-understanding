*Death’s Lawgiver has gazed upon the end of all things, and shares the dark truths she has seen with her unwilling disciples.*
The Abyssal makes a special ({[[Charisma]] or [[Manipulation]]} + [[Lore]]) [[instill]] roll with ([[Essence]]) bonus dice against a single character, revealing the futility of his life and of life itself. If successful, he gains a Major [[Intimacy|Principle]] reflecting his newfound understanding that his life is meaningless and loses two [[Willpower]]. In combat, he also loses four [[Initiative]]. If he has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that supports this belief, the [[Instill|instilled]] [[Intimacy|Principle]] becomes Defining. He can’t voluntarily weaken this [[Intimacy]] until he gains [[Willpower]] from upholding a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] that opposes it.
