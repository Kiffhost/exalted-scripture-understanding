*The Infernal senses the presence of demonic Essence as a garish synesthetic overlay of colours and tastes.*

The Infernal can perceive dematerialized demons. She can sense when a demon comes within range of her senses, even if it’s dematerialized, and adds a non-Charm success on Perception rolls with Awareness, Investigation, or Survival that involve demons.
