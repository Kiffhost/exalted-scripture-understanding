# [[Surrender]]
Pleading for mercy can convince enemies to accept your surrender rather than killing you. This might be a persuade action, or even a bargain (“My family will pay a great ransom for my safe return!”). On a successful roll, your enemy will allow you to surrender, taking you captive or letting you retreat rather than killing you. In most cases, this doesn’t require an [[Intimacy]] to exploit at all—letting a defeated stranger run away is no great hardship. In some cases, it might require exploiting a Minor [[Intimacy]] (when the enemy has some particular reason to want you dead rather than merely captured or vanquished), or even in extraordinary cases a Major [[Intimacy]] (such as a Solar trying to surrender to the Wyld Hunt—a course we don’t generally recommend, since the master of the Hunt is likely to have a valid [[Intimacy]] to cite in the resulting [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] as grounds to deny you mercy.)
