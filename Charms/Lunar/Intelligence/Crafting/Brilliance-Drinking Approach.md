*The Lunar tastes potent inspiration in the heart’s blood of renowned artisans and legendary craftsmen.*
Upon learning this Charm, she gains ten silver points. Additionally, she gains craft points for meeting basic objectives as though she’d completed a basic project (Exalted, p.240) when she claims the shape of a human with at least one Craft rated at 3+, or that the Storyteller deems a professional artisan. At the Storyteller’s discretion, animals capable of significant crafting can also grant this reward. If the Lunar claims the form of a human with Craft ([[Artifact]]) or Craft (Geomancy) 1+, she’s rewarded as per a major project instead. 
A Lunar with [[Demon-Drinking Fang]] (p. XX) may also gain these rewards by destroying spirit artisans.
