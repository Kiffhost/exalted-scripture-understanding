*The piper’s music brings peace even to the Age of Sorrows.*
When she makes a ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) roll to persuade a character to refrain from harming her or the object of one of her positive Ties, the roll waives the [[Resolve]] bonus for not using spoken language and counts as being supported by a Minor [[Intimacy]]. For fae, this counts a Major [[Intimacy]] instead. If a target already has a supporting [[Intimacy]] of that intensity or higher, he suffers an additional −1 [[Resolve]]. If a Lunar uses [[Beast-King Dictates]] (p. XX) or TabooEnforcing Beast (p. XX) with this Evocation, their costs are reduced by two motes each.
