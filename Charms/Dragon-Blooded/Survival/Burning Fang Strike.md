A flame blazes in the eyes of the Dragon-Blood’s familiar as it leaps into battle. When her familiar makes a decisive attack, it adds the Exalt’s [[Initiative]] to the attack’s total damage. A successful attack resets both Exalt and familiar to base [[Initiative]]; they both lose [[Initiative]] on a missed attack. If the familiar’s attack incapacitates a nontrivial opponent or deals enough damage to a battle group to reduce its [[Size]], both it and the Exalt add +2 to base [[Initiative]] on resetting.
