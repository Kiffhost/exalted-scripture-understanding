The Sidereal masters her fear as forcefully as any stallion she’s broken, riding boldly onward into peril. The Sidereal and any mount she rides gain +1 [[Resolve]]. This increases to +3 [[Resolve]] against fearbased influence, but inflicts −1 [[Resolve]] against influence that aligns with [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] of bravery. If the Sidereal has such an [[Intimacy]], her steed gains it as well and adds ([[Intimacy]]) dice on attack rolls and to its Overwhelming.
