*The Infernal answers insults with sevenfold retribution.*

The Infernal clashes an attack against her with a decisive attack. If she has a negative Major or Defining Tie toward her attacker, the clash becomes especially heated, doubling the damage bonus received by the winner and increasing the loser’s Defense penalty by one.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Kissed by Hellish Noon]] (p. XX) reflexively with this Charm, extending the clash attack’s range.
## [[Keys]]
#### Mocking Blade Flourish
The Infernal can clash with a withering attack instead of a decisive one. She doesn’t gain Initiative from this, but if she has a negative Tie toward her attacker, she can gain up to (Intimacy) Initiative.
