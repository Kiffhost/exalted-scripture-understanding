*Beneath the surface of the Abyssal’s words lies a seething void of meaning and malevolence.*
The Abyssal uses two Simple [[Linguistics]] [[Charms]] together in a single text. If both [[Charms]] require a roll, she only rolls once, using the lower of the two dice pools. This roll benefits from any enhancements, like bonus dice or double 9s, provided by either Charm.
