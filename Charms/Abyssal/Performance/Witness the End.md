*Chanting ecstatic litanies that disturb her broken patrons’ slumber, the Abyssal reveals an apocalyptic vision that shatters the world around her.*
The Abyssal makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Performance) inspire roll, ignoring multiple target penalties. Affected characters witness terrifying visions, seeing the world as if it had already ended. Each affected character loses Initiative equal to the Abyssal’s extra successes over their Resolve and suffers the following effects for the rest of the scene
- They’re overcome with sorrow, as per a standard inspire roll. If the Abyssal leverages their despair with social influence, the Willpower cost to resist is increased by one.
- They treat their positive Intimacies’ intensity as one step lower and can’t regain Willpower from upholding them.
- They suffer a −3 penalty on all rolls. This penalty subtracts successes instead of dice on Perception and Awareness rolls and on influence rolls to express positive emotions.
- At the Storyteller’s discretion, a difficulty 3 (Perception + Awareness) roll may be required to notice positive or uplifting details — like the fact that an ally survived a conflagration of pyreflame — when doing so would normally be unrolled.
- Seeing the world as a blighted, shattered wasteland, they treat all movement as being through difficult terrain.
Resisting this influence costs three Willpower, but it can’t be resisted by crashed enemies or trivial opponents. Characters using magic to see through illusion can resist for one Willpower instead.
### Whispers
The Abyssal may invoke her Whispers to add (Whispers) non-Charm dice on the roll.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can flurry this Charm with Grotesque Phantasmagoria (p. XX), ignoring all penalties for doing so. Doing so adds +1 to the difficulty of that Charm’s hazard.
