The Lunar’s keen understanding deduces secret cures and medicines unknown to most physicians. She rolls (Intelligence + [Lore or Medicine]) to introduce a fact about the location of a medicine or natural substance that’s a potent cure for a disease or poison she’s successfully diagnosed. The roll’s difficulty is the disease’s morbidity or the poison’s duration, although the Storyteller may reduce it if the cure will require notable effort to retrieve. Each use of this Charm only introduces one dose — if it’s a flower that can neutralize manticore venom, it will be a nigh-unique rarity, not a common weed. Administering the medication lets the Lunar roll to treat the poison or disease instantly. If she treats a poison, her successes are applied directly to lowering its duration, without needing to overcome its difficulty. If she treats a disease, the patient immediately attempts a roll against its morbidity (Exalted, p. 234). If successful, the disease’s intensity falls by another step after a week has passed. A Lunar who knows Starfish-and-Salamander Meditation (p. XX) can introduce a medicine to speed its healing process, rolling against difficulty 1. Administering the medicine adds all successes from a single interval directly toward the roll’s goal number, instead of having to overcome its difficulty. 

## Special activation rules

A Lunar who knows Bloodand-Tear Elixir Cultivation (p. XX) may use it reflexively with this Charm to internally synthesizes a single dose of the medicine over (7 – Stamina) days instead of needing to retrieve it.
