*Those who serve the Infernal would rather die in battle than facing a traitor’s due..*

The Infernal spends a scene subjecting a battle group to harsh training, gruesome discipline, or ferocious upbraiding. They gain a Minor Tie of terrified awe to the Infernal. It opposes any other fear-based influence and any influence that would make them surrender, spare their foes, or otherwise cease hostilities.

As long as a battle group’s members all have this Tie, it gains the following benefits:
- It counts as having the Tie at an intensity one step higher than the most common intensity among its members.
- If the Infernal orders it to attack, it adds (Intimacy) raw damage.
- It’s immune to the Demoralize stratagem.
- It adds (Intimacy) dice on rout checks. The Infernal adds that many dice on rally and rally for numbers actions.
- Each time it loses Size, it gains +1 Magnitude as wounded and fleeing soldiers are dragged back by their comrades.

If the Infernal uses this Charm after a battle in which an allied battle group dissolved after suffering rout or faced similar losses, she waives its Willpower cost.

The Infernal can stack this Charm to affect up to (Essence) battle groups.
