*Arcs of deathly white Essence swirl around the Hungry Ghost master as she opens her lower soul’s spiritual maw to consume her foes.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have Initiative 12+. She makes a decisive attack against an enemy with lower Initiative, adding dice of damage equal to the difference between their Initiative ratings, up to a maximum of the stylist’s Initiative. If she has a relevant Intimacy of primal emotion, she adds (Essence + Intimacy) to her effective Initiative to determine both the bonus and the maximum damage she can add.
This soul-destroying attack is especially potent against living enemies and ghosts, dealing aggravated damage.
If such an enemy is incapacitated, the stylist devours his higher soul, gaining (his Essence) motes. If she slays one of the living, his lower soul will always rise as a hungry ghost (Exalted, p. 503) the next time the sun sets unless he’s put to rest with magic like the Zenith Caste anima. These revenants have a Defining Tie of terrified obedience toward the martial artist.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by crashing an enemy whose Initiative was higher than the stylist’s.
### Mastery
When the stylist consumes an enemy’s soul, she may incur experience debt (p. XX) to instantly learn up to (Essence) dots of Martial Arts styles that her victim knew. She can also learn one of his Martial Arts Charms, Eclipse Charms, or necromantic spells whose prerequisites she meets. She can’t learn sorcerous spells. She can’t learn Sidereal Martial Arts unless she devours a Sidereal’s soul.
### Terrestrial
This Charm can only be used against crashed enemies.
