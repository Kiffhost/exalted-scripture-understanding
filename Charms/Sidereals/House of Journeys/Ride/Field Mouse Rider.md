*The Sidereal demands the impossible of her familiars and is not disappointed, bending their fates in service to hers.*
The Sidereal can ride one of her familiars no matter how unsuited it is to that task — even a flea can bear her weight. Her familiar doesn’t suffer any ill effects from this. If it has no Speed Bonus listed or a negative Speed Bonus, its Speed Bonus becomes +0; otherwise, its Speed Bonus increases by +1.
If the Sidereal renews this Charm when its duration ends, she waives its Willpower cost.
With an Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can use this Charm to ride animals other than her familiar. If she knows Breaking the Wild Mortal, she can use it on any willing character.
