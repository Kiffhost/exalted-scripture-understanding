The golden etchings upon Heavenly Typhoon glow with righteous fury and snap with lightning. An enemy damaged by a decisive attack is condemned by the weapon’s wrath. Condemnation is permanent unless revoked by Heavenly Typhoon’s wielder, although new wielders don’t gain the benefit of past wielders’ condemnations. Heavenly Typhoon adds (Essence/2, rounded up) withering damage and +1 Overwhelming against condemned foes. 

## Resonant

A character resonant with jade waives this Evocation’s cost against creatures of darkness.
