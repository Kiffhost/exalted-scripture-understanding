*Whether staked by force or cunning, the Abyssal’s claims of ownership are impossible to refute.*
When the Abyssal makes an instill roll to convince someone that an object or structure belongs to her, her target can’t use Intimacies to increase his [[Resolve]] against it or spend [[Willpower]] to resist unless her claim directly contradicts something he knows to be true.
