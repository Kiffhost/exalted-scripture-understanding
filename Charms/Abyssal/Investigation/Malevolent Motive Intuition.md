*Hatred is a motive the Abyssal knows oh so well.*
When the Abyssal succeeds on a [[profile character]] roll, she also learns one of her target’s negative Ties.
Alternatively, a successful [[case scene]] roll also reveals a negative Tie that motivated the events being investigated, if there is one. The [[Storyteller]] should reveal the Tie most relevant to the Abyssal’s purpose for making the roll.
If the Abyssal uncovers an [[Intimacy]] that she possesses herself, she’s refunded up to (her [[Intimacy]]) motes spent on the roll, effortlessly recognizing such familiar enmity.
With [[Investigation]] 5, the Abyssal can narrow her focus to negative Ties with a specific emotional context, like hatred or fear.
