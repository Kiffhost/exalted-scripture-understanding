*The Lawgiver can borrow against her own talent to bolster larcenous action.*
This Charm can be used to aid in protecting the Lawgiver’s disguise during a roll off, to pick a lock, to pickpocket, or to establish [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]]. It can also be used to enhance any social action contrived to swindle a target. For every one automatic success the Charm adds to the selected action, the Solar loses one [[Initiative]] from her next [[Join Battle]] result. The maximum number of successes a Solar can add between battles is half her [[Join Battle]] pool, rounded up. This debt is automatically cleared after completing a full night’s rest. [[Unshakable Rogue’s Spirit]] cannot be used in combat.
