*The Exalt hurls a flashing missile at a fallen weapon, knocking it through the air.*
Anytime a weapon is disarmed within range of her attack, she may use this Charm to strike it from the air, causing it to fly one further range band than where it would have landed.
She may conversely use this to send an ally’s weapon flying back toward him. Using this Charm allows the Exalt to act out of turn, but acts as her [[combat action]] for the turn. A repurchase allows the Exalt to target a weapon that has already fallen, knocking a grounded weapon to the next range band by hitting it with a thrown weapon of her own. 
At [[Essence]] 3+, if the Lawgiver’s [[Initiative]] is higher than the disarmed opponent, she can use this Charm even if she has already attacked for that round. Additionally, at [[Essence]] 3+ the Lawgiver may expressly use this Charm after successfully disarming an opponent with a [[Thrown]]-based attack or gambit.
