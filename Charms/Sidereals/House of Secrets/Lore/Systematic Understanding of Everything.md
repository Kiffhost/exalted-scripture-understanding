The Sidereal has glimpsed hints of a grand design in dreams and half-remembered visions and gained certain insights thereby. After a night’s sleep, the Sidereal gains a temporary [[Lore]] specialty in a topic of her choice. It must be related or thematically relevant to the current story’s events, the Five Maidens, or the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]. She can stack up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) uses of this Charm. Once per story, the Sidereal may permanently purchase a specialty gained with this Charm for one experience point as a training effect (p. XX).
