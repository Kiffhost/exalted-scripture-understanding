## Unacceptable [[Influence]]
There are limits on what can be achieved with social influence. No amount of charisma is sufficient to talk someone into suicide, or to convince a die-hard patriot to betray his cause. If a request is so antithetical to the nature and personality of its target that it cannot possibly succeed, it is said to be *unacceptable influence*. 

A character targeted by unacceptable influence may reject it outright without spending [[Willpower]], even if his [[Resolve]] would not normally be high enough to defend against it. A player can still choose to have his character follow the course of action put forward by unacceptable influence, but only because he thinks it makes sense—the character cannot be coerced into doing it. Some powerful [[Charms]] and spells can also compel characters into bowing to unacceptable influence.

Unacceptable influence includes: 
- Any [[Instill]] action to strengthen or weaken an [[Intimacy]] which doesn’t exploit an appropriately strong [[Intimacy]] to do so.
<details><summary>Example</summary>
A Deathlord’s agent sits down next to a Solar in a teahouse and intimates that the Solar’s Lunar companion is not to be trusted, but she gives no reasons—only dim intimations. The Solar has a Major Tie of trust toward the Lunar. Because the Abyssal exploits no Intimacies to support her suggestions, the Solar can ignore her attempt at weakening his [[Intimacy]] toward the Lunar.

- Any [[Persuade|persuasion]] attempt which doesn't exploit an [[Intimacy]] strong enough to support the proposed task.
<details><summary>Example</summary>
A zealous Immaculate missionary attempts to convince the high priestess of Hamoji, great volcano god of the Wavecrest Archipelago, to abandon her life of worship. This would be a life-changing task, and the priestess has no Defining Intimacies which would support the missionary’s exhortations. As such, the priestess is free to reject the proposed influence at no cost, without the need of a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]].

- Any [[Bargain]] attempt which fails to offer a properly enticing incentive or threaten action which is insufficiently threatening. 
- Any influence that would cause a character to kill himself, or to do something that he knows would result in his certain death. 
- Any influence that would cause a character to completely abandon or end one of his Defining Intimacies is unacceptable. 
<details>A farmer with a Defining Tie of love to his wife might be seduced by another person, but could not be convinced to abandon or murder his wife. A Solar with a Defining Principle of “I will win the allegiance of the sorceress Raksi” could not be convinced to kill her, as this would make fulfilling that goal impossible. Weakening a Defining [[Intimacy]] is still allowed, making it possible to first degrade an [[Intimacy]] from Defining to Major and then issue the otherwise unacceptable influence
</details>
- Any seduction attempt that violates a character’s sexual orientation (as defined by the player, or by the Storyteller in the case of Storyteller characters) is unacceptable.
- Certain [[Charms]] allow characters to define special kinds of influence that they may treat as unacceptable.
