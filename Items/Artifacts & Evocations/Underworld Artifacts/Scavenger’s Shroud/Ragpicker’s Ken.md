*Clad in a carrion-eater’s skin, the Shroud’s wearer hungers for treasures to add to her trove.*
The wearer names a material thing that she desires and senses the approximate distance and direction to the nearest such thing within ([[Essence]] x10) miles. However, she can only sense objects that are owned by someone else, whether living or dead. She adds (Larceny/2, rounded up) dice on [[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], and [[Survival]] rolls to uncover this treasure.
The wearer can seek out generic commodities, like food, coinage, or precious gems, or specific objects, like a certain book or a foe’s daiklave. However, if she seeks a specific object that’s been hidden, she must roll ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Investigation]] or Survival}) against the roll used to conceal it, receiving bonus dice as above.
If the wearer ends this Evocation before obtaining what she desires, she loses one [[Willpower]]. She suffers the same consequence if she fails a roll to detect a hidden treasure.
## Resonant
The added dice are non-Charm.
