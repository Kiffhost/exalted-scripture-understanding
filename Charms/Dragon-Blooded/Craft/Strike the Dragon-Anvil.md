The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s forge imparts a portion of her mighty Essence into the outcome of her craftsmanship, suffusing it with perfection. She doubles 9s on a single Craft roll. An Essence 5 repurchase of this Charm allows the Exalt to use it for ten motes, one Willpower, and one white craft point to double 8s on a Craft roll.
