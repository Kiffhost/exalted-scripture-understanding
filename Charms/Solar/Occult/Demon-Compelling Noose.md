The Lawgiver’s binding pattern stifles the will of her captive, weakening its [[Resolve]]. When using non-[[Occult]] based social influence on a target bound with [[Spirit-Caging Mandala]], the Solar gains one automatic success to her influence, while the trapped spirit is at -1 [[Resolve]] until it escapes. If the captive is a creature of darkness, the Solar gains two automatic successes while the creature’s [[Resolve]] is reduced by -2.
