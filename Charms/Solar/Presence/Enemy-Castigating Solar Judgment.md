The Exalt sears her target with the caustic force of her judgment. This Charm supplements a social influence roll or an attack against a creature of darkness, lowering its [[Resolve]] or its [[Defense]] by one. If the attack is decisive, the damage is aggravated. If the influence is successful, it costs an additional [[Willpower]] to resist. In addition, if this Charm is combined with other [[Charms]] or magic which harm creatures of darkness, then the Solar may use this Charm against characters or ideas for whom she has a Defining Tie of hatred, even if they are not creatures of darkness. This makes those targets susceptible to the effects of all such [[Charms]] for one instant.
