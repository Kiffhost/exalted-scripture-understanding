*The sorcerer lulls the [[Essence]] of air into sleep, transforming it into an opalescent fog of slumber.*
[[Mists of Eventide]] creates a cloud centered on a point out to medium range from the sorcerer, spreading to engulf all characters within short range of the center. Each round that a character breathes or has skin exposed to the mist, he must roll against its poison (Damage 3i/round, Duration 6 rounds, -3 penalty). Characters who are crashed while suffering from the Mists of Eventide’s effects do not take damage from it—instead, they fall into magical slumber, rendered comatose for a single day. 

A sorcerer who knows [[Mists of Eventide]] as his control spell can control the dreams of anyone who sleeps within his mists, causing them not only to dream what he commands, but to physically act out those dreams while sleepwalking. They can even be forced to battle their allies. Controlling someone in this fashion costs one point of [[Willpower]] per individual. Sorcerers with [[Mists of Eventide]] as their control spell sleep fitfully with their eyes wide open unless surrounded by the mists. 
## Special activation rules

[[Mists of Eventide]] can only be cast once per scene, unless reset when a Mists-poisoned opponent falls into [[Initiative]] Crash. 
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 5)
Distorting the mists weakens their efficacy, halving the duration of each dose. Additionally, an opposing sorcerer may wake a character forced into magical slumber with distortion actions targeting him, made at the same goal number.
