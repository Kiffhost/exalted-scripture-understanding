*The Infernal’s forces are as one body, united by the single principle of her will. Each soldier is a mere finger of her outstretched hand; each legion a fist raised to crush all opposition.*

The Infernal becomes a disembodied consciousness, merging with any number of allied battle groups within long range. This has the following effects:
- She has no body or physical existence, though her disembodied consciousness is visible to those who can see dematerialized beings. To the extent her location is relevant, she’s considered to share the location of all affected battle groups.
- She acts independently of the assimilated battle groups, but can choose to use a group’s Initiative instead of her own to determine when she takes her turn in a round. She does not need to make this choice until the tick she takes her turn on.
- The Infernal’s range of action is limited. She can take command actions targeting battle groups, doubling 8s and receiving [[Universal Command Application]]’s benefits for free. She can use their senses to make Perception-based rolls and can make influence rolls by speaking through them. Other than that, she can’t take any actions unless the Storyteller deems them compatible with her disembodied form.
- Assimilated battle groups gain perfect morale and treat any influence that would cause them to disobey her as unacceptable.
- She can’t be harmed directly by attacks unless they target an area and are capable of striking dematerialized foes. The same is true for similar harmful effects, like poison or environmental hazards, but doesn’t apply against influence rolls.
- When an assimilated battle group loses a dot of Size, she suffers one level of unavoidable lethal damage and must make a ({Intelligence or Wits} + War) to sustain this Charm. The difficulty is the same as the rout check faced by the damaged battle group, with +1 difficulty for each such roll she’s made previously during the scene. On a failed roll, this Charm ends and she reforms within close range of the damaged battle group. She may reflexively roll (Wits + War) roll to disguise herself as a fleeing soldiers.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Splintered Gale Legion]] reflexively with this Charm, waiving its Willpower cost, to create and possess a battle group of duplicates.
