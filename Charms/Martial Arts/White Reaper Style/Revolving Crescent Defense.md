The White Reaper is most at ease when surrounded by enemies, turning their strength of numbers to her own advantage. The Revolving Crescent Defense cancels all onslaught penalties to the martial artist’s Parry against a single attack, instead converting each point of penalty into a +1 bonus to her Parry. 

## Mastery

This Charm’s duration is extended until the martial artist’s next turn.
