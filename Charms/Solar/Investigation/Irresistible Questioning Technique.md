The Lawgiver may wring the truth from a subject with piercing, impossible-to-resist questions. This Charm supplements a persuade action (p. 216) in the form of a question. Roll the Solar’s ([[Wits]] + [[Investigation]]) against the target’sResolve.Successmeansthatthecharactermustanswer truthfully and to the fullest extent of his knowledge. In addition, each extra success on this roll constitutes an additional question the Solar may ask, and each of those questions is likewise irresistible. The target of this Charm may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist answering a single question, but this grants no immunity to further questioning, or even the same question posed repeatedly. No [[Willpower]] is requiredtoresistthisquestionifthecharacterisabletoescape the scene or leave freely; in combat, the power is compelling but costs no [[Willpower]] to resist. Likewise, a character who feels compelled to stay, even if they may leave freely, must pay [[Willpower]] to resist a question. This Charm may only be used on a specific character once per session.
