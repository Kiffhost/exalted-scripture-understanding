From repairing a wagon wheel to forging a [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Generic [[Artifact]] Weapons/Daiklave]] which will be carried into battle for centuries to come, crafting in Exalted is encompassed by four categories describing the nature and difficulty of a project, each with its own demands and rewards. The categories of crafting projects are: [[Basic Project]], [[Major Project]], [[Superior Project]], and [[Legendary Project]].
# Elements of Crafting
Crafting projects have two special concerns, described below: [[#Project Slots]] and [[#Crafting Experience]]. In brief, characters can only support a certain number of simultaneous crafting projects, which take a toll on their creative energies—these are abstracted into project slots. By contrast, successfully finishing projects renews the character’s inspiration and helps further her skill and ambitions, allowing her to take on greater numbers of projects and to see more difficult and demanding projects to completion. This is modeled as the character gaining crafting experience.
# Crafting Experience
Characters earn crafting experience for successfully completing crafting projects, which can then be spent to engage in more powerful crafting projects (described below). In short, there are three types of crafting experience: 
- **Silver experience points** (sxp) are primarily earned from completing [[Basic Project|basic projects]], and can be spent to finish [[Major Project|major projects]]. 
- **Gold experience points** (gxp) are primarily earned from completing major projects, and can be spent to finish [[Superior Project|superior projects]]. 
- **White experience points** (wxp) are primarily earned from completing superior projects, and can be spent to finish [[Legendary Project|legendary projects]].
## Basic Objectives
When a character finishes a crafting project, there are three basic objectives to be aware of. For each of these objectives a character triggers, he is eligible to earn a crafting experience reward. These rewards stack—each objective triggered provides the entire reward again. The exact values awarded depend on the sort of project undertaken. 

- When finishing your project causes another character to gain or strengthen an [[Intimacy]] toward you, you gain [[#Crafting Experience]]. 
- When finishing your project produces a clear in-game gain for your character, such as a monetary payment, or a new [[Merits|Merit]] like [[Allies]] or [[Contacts]], you gain crafting experience. 
- When finishing your project upholds, furthers, or protects one of your character’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], you gain crafting experience. 

Additionally, crafters may earn crafting experience at the end of a story. 

At the end of a story, characters gain:
- **3 silver experience points** for each [[Craft]] Ability rated at 3+ that was used to complete a project during the story.
- 5 **silver experience points** for each [[Craft]] Ability rated at 5+ that was used to complete a project during the story.
- 5 **gold experience points** per artifact successfully created during the story.
# Project Slots
Project slots are an abstract representation of how well the character can split focus between multiple significant projects at once. There are three sorts of project slots: 
- **Major project slots** are used when a character undertakes a major project. 
- **Superior project slots** are used when a character starts a superior project. 
- **Legendary project slots** are required for legendary projects. 

When a character starts a project, it occupies a relevant slot until the project ends in either success or failure. *Normally, characters have only **3** **major project slots** to work with, but they can spend crafting experience to temporarily push their boundaries and obtain additional slots.* 
# First Age Wonders
<details><summary>Context</summary>
<p>In the lost, long-ago height of the First Age, the [[Solar Exalted]] combined artifice, [[sorcery]], geomancy, and a Creation-spanning infrastructure of powerful magic to create artifacts of enormous complexity and precisely-calibrated function. These marvels of First Age artifice harnessed the power of manses and demesnes from afar, projected shattering [[Essence]] bolts from the decks of warships, and even hauled mighty vessels aloft to soar among the clouds on beams of focused power.
<br><br>
That Age is long gone today. In the Solars’ absence, the infrastructure they forged and maintained crumbled while their precisely-calibrated spells and crafts were lost, forgotten, or simply proved beyond the ken or power of the remaining Chosen. In the Second Age, functioning examples of First Age artifice are surpassingly rare, and jealously coveted by princes, Exalts, gods, and would-be warlords of all sorts. Only the crudest examples survive in any numbers, such as the implosion bows mounted by the Realm on the decks of a bare handful of their most powerful warships or the scant few suits of gunzosha battle armor fielded with the most elite mortal soldiers of Lookshy. </p>

Creating and repairing such First Age wonders requires a depth of genius and resources largely unavailable in the current Age. It follows the same rules as [[Superior Project|creating]] or [[Repair|repairing]] any other [[Artifact]], with the following important exceptions: 
- The character must perform these repairs and construction with the [[Craft]] (First Age Artifice) Ability. The character cannot begin buying this Ability unless she possesses [[Lore]] 5, [[Occult]] 5, [[Craft]] (Artifacts) 5, and is capable of at least [[Charms/Solar/Occult/Terrestrial Circle Sorcery]]. 
- All crafting and repairs must be done with [[#Crafting Experience|white points]], regardless of the artifact’s dot rating. 
- Each attempt to finish the project or to roll to repair such an artifact must generally be preceded by a sorcerous project (p. 483) to design key components or replacements for damaged parts (the Storyteller may opt to waive this requirement for very basic repairs). The most standard example is to use [[sorcery]] to craft a slate of solidified [[Essence]] which can be carved or fused into circuit-like channels, conductors for the artifact’s subtle miracles. Crafting or repairing an artifact rated 2 or 3 requires Terrestrial Circle workings, 4 and 5 require at least one Celestial Circle working in addition to Terrestrial Circle workings, and an N/A example of First Age artifice requires at least one Solar Circle working and multiple Celestial Circle workings.
