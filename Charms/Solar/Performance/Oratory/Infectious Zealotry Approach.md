The Lawgiver distills all the power and passion of an entire speech into a single statement, striking her target with an all-consuming fiery ambition. When the Solar perceives a character who is about to put off making a social influence attempt that the Solar believes should be attempted now, she may use this Charm, rolling a ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance) based action against her targetâ€™s Resolve. The Solar inveighs against inaction and scorns all dereliction. If successful, her feverish contagion of will causes the target to forget all other concerns, goals, and ambitions, focusing socially on a single social objective for the rest of the scene. This effect can be resisted by paying one Willpower, but the affected character may only pay this Willpower if confronted by some circumstance that would force him to abandon a Defining Intimacy in order to carry out his social influence action.
