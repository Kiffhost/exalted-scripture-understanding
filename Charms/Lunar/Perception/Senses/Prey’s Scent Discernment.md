The Lunar has a keen recollection for the scent of sweat and blood. When she succeeds on a scent-based [[Awareness]] roll to detect or examine a character, a profile character roll, or a read intentions roll, she memorizes her target’s scent. Memorized scents are normally retained for one day, but the scents of characters she has a Major or Defining Tie toward and of her Solar mate are retained indefinitely. If the Lunar encounters a character whose scent she’s memorized, she may pay two motes to recognize him. If he employs a disguise enhanced by magic or specifically devised to mask his scent, she instead adds a non-Charm success on rolls to see through it. With a [[Perception]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, successful case scene or tracking rolls let the Lunar memorize her target’s scent, so long as it’s no more than ([[Essence]] + [[Perception]]) days old.
