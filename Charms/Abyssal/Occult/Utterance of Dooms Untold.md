*The Abyssal speaks the Old Laws anew, asserting spiritual dominion over death itself.*
The Abyssal speaks in an eerie discordance that is not a language, understood instinctively by the undead and other creatures of darkness. She adds two dice on [[Occult]] rolls as long as she uses this bleak tongue in her stunt. With [[Essence]] 3, the dice bonus increases to ([[Essence]]).
However, while using this Charm, the Abyssal loses her ability to comprehend any other languages, except when listening to the undead and creatures of darkness.
With an [[Occult]] 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to enhance this Charm. Any roll that receives its bonus dice also rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10, maximum ([[Essence]]).
