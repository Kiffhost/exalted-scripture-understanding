*The Infernal swings her brutal implement with overwhelming force, making her enemies’ grace and finesse meaningless.*

The Infernal can use Strength instead of Dexterity on attacks with heavy and medium weapons, and to calculate her Parry with such weapons. This doesn’t benefit from effects that grant bonus Strength dots, double successes on Strength rolls, or replace her Strength with a higher value.
