*The deathknight unerringly senses spite, fear, and disdain.*
When the Abyssal makes a [[read intentions]] roll to uncover a negative [[Intimacy]], that [[Intimacy]] penalizes the target’s [[Guile]] as with [[Resolve]]. She also gains this benefit on rolls to discern motivations driven by such Intimacies, Additionally, if the target’s intentions in the current scene are driven by a [[persuade]] roll that leveraged that [[Intimacy]] or by similar influence, the deathknight also learns what his intentions are.
