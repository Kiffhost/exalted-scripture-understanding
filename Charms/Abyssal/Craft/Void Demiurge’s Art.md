*The Abyssal’s eerie genius demands expression in works worthy of her prowess.*
The deathknight doubles 9s on a [[Craft]] roll. She can’t use this Charm on rolls for [[Superior Project|superior]] and [[Legendary Project|legendary projects]].
With a [[Craft]] 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm on [[Superior Project|superior projects]]. She may pay a surcharge of one [[Willpower]] and one gold point to double 8s.
With [[Craft]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, a third purchase lets the Abyssal use this Charm on [[Legendary Project|legendary projects]]. She may pay a surcharge of one white point to double 7s. (She doesn’t need to pay the previous repurchase’s surcharge).
