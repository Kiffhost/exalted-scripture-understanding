Burning Branch’s blazing battle spirit cannot be contained, erupting in an overwhelming blaze. This Evocation may supplement a decisive attack made on the same turn the Exalt ignites Burning Branch, adding (Essence) bonus successes on the attack roll and doubling 10s on damage. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with jade, this Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder sockets a fire-aspected hearthstone in Burning Branch.
