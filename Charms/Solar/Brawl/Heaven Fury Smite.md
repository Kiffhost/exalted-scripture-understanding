Sensing her opponent is near collapse, the Exalt lashes out with a lightning fast decisive attack. Heaven Fury Smite can be used when the Lawgiver lands an attack that drives her target into crash. It automatically resets her attack action, allowing her to attack again instantly, so long as she launches a decisive attack against the crashed opponent. This attack may be made with any viable Ability—the Solar experiences a burst of speed that allows her to reflexively draw a weapon, be it a sword or a nearby tree branch.
