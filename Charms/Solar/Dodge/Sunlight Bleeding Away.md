*The Solar melts across the landscape in a fluidity of motion.*
This Charm can be activated upon succeeding at a disengage action, allowing the Solar to reflexively retreat in the face of enemy movement twice, rather than once. Thus, if the Solar disengaged successfully, she would move back the first and second time an opponent approached on his turn.
