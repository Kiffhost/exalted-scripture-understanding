Harnessing dangerous mutagenic power, the sorcerer may add ([[Appearance]] + [[Integrity]]) non-Charm dice to a [[shape sorcery]] action. In return, she suffers a gruesome but cosmetic transformation of the ST’s choice, inflicting a −3 penalty on [[social influence]] and [[disguise]] rolls. She can’t use this shaping ritual again until after a night spent meditating, during which the sorcerer renews her body-perfecting workings to remove the transformation.
