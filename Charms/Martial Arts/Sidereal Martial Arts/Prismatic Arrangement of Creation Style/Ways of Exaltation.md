*The martial artist strikes her throat, abdomen, spine, brow, and crown in a lightning-swift blur, altering the pattern of her [[Essence]] to conceal her Exaltation.*
The stylist chooses an Exalt type she’s familiar with and a Caste or Aspect, causing her anima banner to take on an appropriate appearance and mimicking effects like the anima flux of the Dragon-Blooded. If she uses native [[Charms]] with overtly supernatural effects, they change to resemble the mimicked Exalt type’s magic. She adds (Anima) dice on rolls with chosen Caste or Aspect’s Attributes or Abilities and adds (Anima/2, rounded up) to static values based on them. If the martial artist uses this Charm to emulate a Dragon-Blood, she can enter Elemental Aura using the Immaculate Dragon styles’ [[Charms]] or [[Five Jade Fury]], letting her access the Immaculate Charms’ Aura benefits.
## Enlightenment
While emulating a different Caste of the stylist’s Exalt type, she gains that Caste’s anima powers in addition to her own.
