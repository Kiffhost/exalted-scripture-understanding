*Bludgeoning a foe with overwhelming force, the Lunar sends him reeling.*
She makes a withering attack, adding ([[Essence]]) dice of post-soak damage. If she deals any damage, her target is stunned. Until his next turn ends, his onslaught penalty applies to any rolls he makes. Even after his onslaught penalty refreshes, it applies until his turn ends. If the Lunar’s attack crashes him, his onslaught penalty doesn’t refresh and subtracts from his dice pools until he’s recovered from crash. Example: Zephyr Scales-of-[[War]] damages an Infernal with [[Ox-Dragon Smash]]. The Infernal’s −1 onslaught penalty subtracts from any rolls he makes, in addition to his [[Defense]]. If subsequent attacks raise his onslaught, the penalty on his rolls increases as well. Once his onslaught penalty refreshes (typically when his next turn starts), the penalty continues to apply until that turn ends.
