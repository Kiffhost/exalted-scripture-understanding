*The Sidereal sanctifies a ceremony in Heaven’s eyes, closing any loose ends in its fate.*
When the Sidereal participates in a ceremony or ritual — a wedding, a funeral, a banquet, a coming-of-age ritual, etc. — she rolls (Charisma + Performance) against a difficulty of (8 – ceremony’s Resources cost). If she succeeds, she blesses up to (1 + extra successes) other characters who participated in the ceremony. They can subsequently gain −1 target number on a single roll related to the ceremony: rolling Medicine to care for a recently wedded spouse, Socialize to conduct negotiations over a banquet, etc. Their good fortune also has narrative manifestations: Newlyweds who wish for a child are much more likely to conceive, a dead man’s written will is fortuitously found, etc.
Once per day, the Sidereal gains one Willpower and loses one Limit when she upholds a Major or Defining Tie by using this Charm.
With a Performance 4, Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a nine-mote surcharge to also grant the blessed characters the benefits of one of her Ascending (Caste) Horoscope Charms and extend this Charm’s duration to Indefinite. The ceremony or ritual must somehow relate to one of the constellations whose blessings she knows for that Charm.
## Special activation rules
The Sidereal can use Perfection in Life reflexively with this Charm, treating the roll for the ceremony as her inspire roll.
