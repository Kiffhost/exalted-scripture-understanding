The Dragon-Blood strikes at stress points in a foe’s armor. On a successful decisive attack, her weapon becomes embedded in her enemy’s armor, lowering its soak by one point and raising its mobility penalty by one. Unarmored enemies are unaffected unless the Storyteller deems the enemy’s body super-durable, like an automaton’s metal body or a tyrant lizard’s thick scales. Removing the embedded weapon is a Strength 3 feat of strength at difficulty (higher of Essence or Strength) that can be attempted by the target or any of his allies within close range, negating the penalty on success. In Earth Aura, the Exalt can embed multiple weapons into an enemy’s armor with successive uses of this Charm. Each weapon’s penalty stacks, maximum (Essence + 1), and requires a separate action to remove.
