*The Infernal’s inner demon can’t be caged for long, ripping itself free of her mortality with a monstrous roar.*

Upon purchasing this Charm, the Infernal gains one of its [[Keys]]. Each allows her to reset her [[Devil-Body]]’s once-per-story limit or otherwise bypass the limit. She ignores the limit entirely during Calibration.

With Essence 3, the Infernal can immediately enter her [[Devil-Body]] when she resets it with this Charm.
## Reset
Once per story. With Essence 3, this becomes once per session.
## [[Keys]]
#### Breaking Point Rampage
The Infernal can use this Charm when subjected to extreme duress or torment: being forced to act against a Defining Intimacy, being imprisoned under agonizing conditions, watching someone she has a Defining Tie of love for die, etc.
#### Hellish Eruption Unleashed
The Infernal ignores the once-per-story limit while in [[Limit Break]]. With Essence 3, she can enter her [[Devil-Body]] when she undergoes [[Limit Break]].
#### Immortal Vengeance Apotheosis
The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] resets when she’s incapacitated by an enemy for whom she has a negative Defining Tie.
#### Triumphant Devil-Monster
The Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] resets when she accomplishes a legendary social goal.
#### The Face of the Titans (Essence 5) (+20m, 1wp)
Once per story, the Infernal can pay a twenty-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to reset her [[Devil-Body]] and immediately enter it whenever she meets one of its trigger conditions.
