The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s aggression stokes her Essence hotter and higher as she strikes relentlessly at her opponent, until he finally falls before her onslaught. She may add bonus dice on a Melee attack roll for one mote each, or raise her Parry for two motes per +1. When she lands an attack against an enemy or blocks one with this Charm, the cost of using this Charm against him is cumulatively lowered by one mote on subsequent rounds. Missing an attack or failing to parry resets the discount, as does attacking or blocking against another enemy, or going a round without using this Charm.
