### Prerequisite
[[Archery]], [[Brawl]], [[Melee]], [[Martial Arts]], or [[Thrown]] •••
The character possesses the lightning draw of a deadly duelist. At one dot, she suffers no [[Defense]] penalty for taking a draw/ready weapon action. At four dots, if she flurries a draw/ready weapon action and an attack action, the flurry penalty is reduced to -1 rather than -3. This Merit must be purchased separately for each of the attack Abilities.
