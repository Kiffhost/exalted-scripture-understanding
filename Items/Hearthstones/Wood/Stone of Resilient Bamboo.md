This stone gleams the pale green of young bamboo leaves. When its bearer sockets it in an attuned artifact and commits one mote, it helps shrug off minor injuries. She adds two to her soak, can parry lethal attacks unarmed without a stunt, and halves healing times for bashing damage. Gem of Incomparable Wellness (Wood, Greater) Keywords: Dependent, Linked
This cluster of emerald crystals continually changes shape, with new crystals budding and subsuming the old. Endless vitality suffuses its bearer, mending her wounds with unnatural swiftness. If she commits three motes to the stone, she regains one bashing health level per ten minutes, one lethal health level per hour, and one aggravated health level per day. Fatal diseases or lethal deprivation, such as starvation, dehydration, or drowning, only render her unconscious. Even dismemberment or cremation merely fills her health track with lethal or aggravated damage, respectively, from which she will eventually regenerate. This power only terminates if the Exalt loses attunement to the stone, or if it becomes inert or is destroyed.
