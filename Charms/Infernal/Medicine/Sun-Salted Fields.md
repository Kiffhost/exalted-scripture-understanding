*The Infernal shines with an invisible radiance that blights all that it touches, sickening land and life alike.*

The Infernal unleashes a burst of invisible light that exposes all characters within long range to [[Green Sun Wasting]], except for allied demons and Infernals. It expands outward by one range band into extreme range at the start of each of the Infernal’s turns. The spread of infection stops if the Infernal takes a non-reflexive action, moves or is moved, or is crashed.

Outside of combat, the blight extends outward by one mile per hour, maximum (Essence) miles. Instead of inflicting disease directly, this blights the land. Plant life grows sickly as a fine patina of tarnish spreads across it, while living things must resist exposure to [[Green Sun Wasting]] for each hour they spend in the blighted region.

The virulence of the tainted land’s infection drops by one for each day that passes. Once it falls to zero, the blight subsides.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Intimacy by infecting others with [[Green Sun Wasting]]. No reset is needed if the infection doesn’t spread outside of combat.
