*The stylist moves with the swift precision of one who knows the inevitability of her journey’s end.*
The onslaught penalty inflicted by the stylist’s attack applies to her target’s Defense against that attack roll. If she deals 5+ withering damage or any decisive damage, she treats her target’s onslaught penalty as a wound penalty for this style’s Charms, stacking with any existing wound penalties. This lasts until his onslaught refreshes.
