Throughexposureandresistance,theSolartrainsheranima to eat toxins and neutralize sicknesses. When activated, this Charm makes the Solar invulnerable to any toxin or illness she has ever been exposed to previously. She cannot be injured by familiar venom and cannot contract prior illnesses. She can sprinkle poison on her food as a condiment or walk hand-in-hand with a plague victim and be unaffected—so long as she has had exposure to these maladies. This Charm also assists the Solar in fighting toxins and disease she is unfamiliar with. When exposed to new toxins, the expected duration is reduced by one. When exposed to a new disease, the morbidity rating is lowered by one. In addition, if the Solar’s Stamina is at least 3, she encounters incurable and irresistible diseases as if they had a morbidity of 5.
