*Cruel laughter seeps through cracks and crevices in the world as the sorcerer shapes the raw stuff of mockery into a crude leather mask that snaps into place around her victim’s face.*

The sorcerer lobs the fool’s mask over the face of a character within short range, stitching leather to flesh with threads of raw Essence. This requires a difficulty 2 (Wits + Occult) gambit against unwilling targets. Others perceive the masked character as a fool unfit for serious consideration, which is treated as a Major Tie of contempt. This Intimacy always opposes the victim’s influence unless it comports with his new, unwilling role.

The mask falls from the victim’s face once this spell ends. Removing it prematurely is exactly as painful as cutting off the victim’s true face, requiring a difficulty 4 (Intelligence + Medicine) roll for an hour-long surgery. Doing so leaves their face beneath bloody and raw for the spell’s duration.
# Control
The sorcerer’s lips creak like leather when she smiles falsely. When she affects a happy or contented countenance, she gains +1 Guile. If she has a negative Tie toward her target, the spell’s duration increases to (Essence + Intimacy) days, and she can gain a point of Willpower when she sees the victim suffer a significant setback as a result of the spell, though only once per casting.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 8)
The mask conforms itself more tightly to the target’s face, better translating their actual expressions. Other characters’ scorn only counts as a Minor Tie for the scene.
