*The stylist dances around a foe, alternating unpredictably between moving in too close for proper leverage and pivoting back just out of reach.*
The stylist chooses an enemy within close range. Her target suffers a −3 penalty on attack rolls, rush rolls, and disengage rolls against her, and on his rolls to rise from prone. Whenever he fails on a penalized roll, he loses one [[Initiative]].
This Charm ends if the stylist moves out of close range with her target.
## Special activation rules
This Charm can be used reflexively upon moving into close range with a target whose [[Initiative]] is lower than the stylist’s.
## Mastery
This Charm’s reflexive activation can be used against enemies with equal or higher [[Initiative]].
