The Sidereal erases any stigma or controversy her actions may carry, making her faux pas and indiscretions unremarkable to others. When the Sidereal commits a faux pas or violates a custom, she makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Socialize]]) instill roll against all who witnessed it, ignoring multiple target penalties. A character whose [[Resolve]] is beaten won’t care about the faux pas and can’t form negative Ties toward the Sidereal or weaken positive Ties to her as a result. It doesn’t excuse consequences for violating laws. If the Sidereal’s extra successes against a character equal or exceed his [[Essence]], he’s convinced the Sidereal’s conduct was appropriate and admirable, gaining an appropriate Minor [[Intimacy|Principle]]. A character who was directly harmed or inconvenienced by the Sidereal’s act or who has an [[Intimacy]] opposed to it may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist this influence.
