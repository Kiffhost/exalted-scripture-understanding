In the instant she’s struck, the Lunar’s body becomes fluid and malleable. Blades and arrows move through her flesh without harming it; the tiniest gaps in an avalanche let her fluid form pass; she even seeps through acid and lava unharmed. She can apply [[Defense|Evasion]] against undodgeable attacks (but not ambushes), or else gain +1 [[Defense|Evasion]]. Once per scene, if an attack beats her [[Defense|Evasion]], she may pay one [[Willpower]] to subtract (her [[Defense|Evasion]] against the attack) successes from the damage roll. If she takes no damage from a non-gambit attack, she’s considered to have dodged it. This effect can be reset by successfully dodging three decisive attacks from nontrivial opponents. Alternatively, she may use this Charm, paying its [[Willpower]] surcharge, to perfectly dodge a source of [[uncountable damage]], rendering her immune to a recurring source of [[uncountable damage]] for a scene. This doesn’t require this Charm to be reset.
