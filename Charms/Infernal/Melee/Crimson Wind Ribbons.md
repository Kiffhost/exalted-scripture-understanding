*Beautiful droplets of blood stain the wind before the Infernal’s victim realizes she struck him.*

The Infernal can uses this when she deals 5+ withering damage to an enemy whose Initiative was already lower than hers. She reflexively make a withering or decisive attack against that enemy.
## [[Keys]]
#### Excitable Killer Urgency (Melee 3) (+1i, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Initiative, one-Willpower surcharge to make a reflexive decisive attack with this Charm at any time. She can’t do so if she took a full defense or defend other action on her last turn. If she knows [[Self-as-Cyclone Stance]], she can use it reflexively instead of making a single attack.
