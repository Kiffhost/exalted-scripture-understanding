*Black lightning arcs across the Infernal’s body, giving her a taste of the horror felt by the slain Primordials as she embraces their forbidden power.*

The Infernal becomes undead and can use Ivory Circle necromancy. She learns one Ivory Circle spell for free — her control spell — and gains one free shaping ritual. However, she can only use necromancy while in this Charm’s death-fugue. The transformation lasts until she uses this Charm again.
