A consummate deceiver, the Dragon-Blood can live as countless false selves. Using this Charm, she devises a fictitious identity over the course of at least an hour, gaining a temporary specialty that applies on [[Larceny]] rolls to disguise herself as that identity, to her [[Guile]] against rolls that would contradict her disguise, and on influence rolls made to convince others of her disguise or explain away discrepancies or inconsistencies in her portrayal of that identity.
When a character makes a roll opposing the Dragon-Blood’s disguise as that character, she can pay three motes and one [[Willpower]] to make a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Socialize]]) instill roll against his [[Resolve]], which can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]]. Instead of a normal instill roll’s effects, success imposes a penalty of (1 + threshold successes) on his roll. If multiple characters roll against the Dragon-Blood’s disguise simultaneously, she need only pay the [[Willpower]] cost once, and makes a single roll against all of them.
The Dragon-Blood may stack this Charm to maintain up to (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Manipulation]]) cover identities.
