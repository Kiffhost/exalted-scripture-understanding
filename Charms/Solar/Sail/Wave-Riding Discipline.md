The Solar’s [[Essence]] suffuses the hull, mast and sails, lightening the ship until it rises out of the water and planes over the top of the waves. While this Charm is active, the ship’s sails are more effective, doubling the ship’s sailderived speed bonus. The ship also gains an additional point of speed for favorable currents. However, the ship’s speed bonus for having oarsmen (if it has any) falls to one (if it is higher), and the ship may not benefit from being pulled by a sea monster or other beast which would drag the hull back down into the waves. This Charm is incompatible with [[Tide-Cutting [[Essence]] Infusion]].
