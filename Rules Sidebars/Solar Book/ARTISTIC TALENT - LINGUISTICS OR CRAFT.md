Linguistics is not the “Art” skill, any more than Investigation is the “Sight” skill. Linguistics does entail a very specific artistic skill—in the ability to produce elegant calligraphy, and the ability to produce, translate, or reproduce very specific aesthetics. Language in itself is a representative of such aesthetics: words evolve from pictograms to ideograms, hieroglyphs form and refine into runes that make up descendent languages thousands of years later. Very specific forms of art are also constructs of language: maps, diagrams, and supplemental illustrations fall into these categories. Where art is concerned, Linguistics mainly provides the ability to produce beautiful and complex letters, and extremely complex, detailed informational illustrations. Drawing one’s Lunar mate gobbling cake, or painting a gorgeous landscape or a portrait of the Circle’s Twilight, are all examples of the Craft Ability.
