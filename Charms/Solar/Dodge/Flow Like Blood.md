The Exalt permeates her being with [[Essence]], becoming partly atomized. For the rest of the scene, when dodging attacks by opponents with lower [[Initiative]] than her own, the Lawgiver ignores all penalties to her [[Defense|Evasion]]. Attacks which miss her often seem to pass harmlessly through her dreamlike form. While this Charm is active, [[Reed in the Wind]] costs only one [[Initiative]] per [[Defense|Evasion]], and each round that the Solar remains within close range of an enemy without being struck by an attack—either due to her [[Defense|Evasion]], or due to not being attacked—she gains a point of [[Initiative]].
