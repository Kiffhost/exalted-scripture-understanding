*The Immaculate strikes her own pressure points and chakras with a series of quick, precise blows, bringing her Essence into perfect alignment.*
She gains (lower of Essence or Stamina) temporary âˆ’1 health levels the first time she enters this form in the scene. She keeps these health levels even if she leaves this form. At the end of the scene, these temporary health levels fade, and all damage contained in them returns to her normal health track. 
Additionally, when the Immaculate lands a decisive attack from 12+ Initiative that incapacitates a nontrivial enemy, she resets Mind-Over-Body Meditation. 
## Special activation rules
When the Immaculate heals enough damage from Mind-Over-Body Meditation or similar effects to reduce her wound penalty, she may reflexively enter this Form.
