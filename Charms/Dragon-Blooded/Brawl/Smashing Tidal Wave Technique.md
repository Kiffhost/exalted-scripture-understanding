*!!TheDragon-Bloodpinsherfoesbeneaththeweightofthe!! seas, crushing them under a torrential cascade of water.*
When she uses [[Currents Sweep to Sea]], she may unleash a flood of water from the depths of her anima banner, amplifying the tendril of water she creates with both intense pressure and incredible size. She can grapple a foe within long range, and doubles 8s on the control roll. If succcessful, the Dragon-Blood may choose to drag the clinched enemy one or two range bands towards her, pinning him beneath a high-pressure downpour or entangling him in giant coils of water. She still takes the normal penalties of grappling regardless of the distance between them, as she must maintain focus to control it. Restraining him with this mighty downpour only costs one round of control. If she savages, slams, or throws him, she adds (Strength/2, rounded up) automatic successes on withering damage rolls, or (Strength/2, rounded up) dice on decisive damage rolls.
