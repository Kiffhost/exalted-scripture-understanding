*The Infernal limns her hands in an emerald radiance that burns away lesser afflictions.*

The Infernal adds (higher of Essence or 3) non-Charm dice on a roll to treat disease or poison and doubles 8s. However, her patient suffers two dice of unavoidable aggravated damage from the healing radiance.

With Medicine 5, Essence 2, the Infernal can pay a six-mote surcharge to double 7s.
## [[Keys]]
#### Pestilence-Annihilating Flame (+1wp)
The Infernal can burn away a disease entirely on a successful roll, curing her patient completely, but doing so exposes him to [[green sun wasting]] (p. XX) in addition to dealing damage. He automatically fails his roll against its virulence, but adds (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) dice on rolls against its morbidity. Its intensity can’t rise above Minor if the treated disease was mundane or Major for supernatural diseases.
#### Lesser Evil Mercy (Medicine 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal’s patient only suffers one die of aggravated damage. If she has [[#Pestilence-Annihilating Flame (+1wp)|Pestilence-Annihilating Flame]], the [[green sun wasting]] inflicted for curing supernatural diseases can’t rise above Minor intensity. When curing mundane diseases, the wasting fades entirely after (10 – Infernal’s Essence) days.
