The Sidereal weeps tears of blood onto her weapon, mourning the violence she is about to inflict. The Sidereal’s damage roll gains −1 target number. If her enemy has a −2 or worse wound penalty, it gains −2 target number instead. If she has a positive Tie to him, the attack supports it; such is her hypothetical sorrow.
