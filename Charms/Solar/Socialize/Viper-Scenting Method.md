*While using [[Mastery of Small Manners]], the Lawgiver has a perfect intuition for social mores.*
While under its effects, the Lawgiver can use [[Viper-Scenting Method]] to augment her sense of social harmonics, such that she automatically notices when a character expresses disfavor toward her, even if they express it indirectly through a gesture, facial expression, disinterest in the Solarâ€™s words, or whispered comments to someone else. The Lawgiver need not be watching or listening for such cues; this Charm points them out to her. Since [[Mastery of Small Manners]] makes it impossible to impugn her etiquette, the Solar understands by process of elimination that xenophobic or other personal attitudes make the initiate distrust or dislike her. Still, the Lawgiver does not know the exact context of any [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] the character might hold. However, this Charm grants one automatic non-Charm success to reveal such an [[Intimacy]] with a read intentions action.

### On [[Viper-Scenting Method]]

The backer wanted a Charm to amp up the power of [[Mastery of Small Manners]], helping him to establish himself in a lasting role within a culture. The biggest obstacle to foreign inclusion are the prohibitive biases of members of that culture. This Charm helps the Solar figure out the exact context of those attitudes by aiding her in revealing related [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. By gathering social intelligence, the Solar can work to defeat those who might seek to undermine her position in a foreign society. Backer: Matthew Pascal
