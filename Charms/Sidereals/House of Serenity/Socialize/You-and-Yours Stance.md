The Sidereal vanishes within the blazing incandescence of her desirability; those who look upon see only that she is their most valuable possession and that to disappoint her would break their own hearts. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  Her identity is perfectly concealed. 
-  She adds (Essence) dice on instill rolls to create Ties of romantic or sexual desire toward her and on persuade and bargain rolls for seduction. 
-  Against characters with Ties of romantic or sexual desire toward her, she’s treated as having a bonus dot of Appearance, which can raise it above 5. 
-  Enemies with base Resolve less than her Appearance can’t attack her or take other harmful action against her unless they pay one Willpower to resist for the scene.
