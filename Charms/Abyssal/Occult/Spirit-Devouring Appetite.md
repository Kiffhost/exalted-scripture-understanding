*The Abyssal may seize knowledge and power from the fragments of a destroyed spirit.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm upon permanently destroying a spirit, absorbing its [[Essence]] to temporarily gain [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]] and mutations that reflect its nature. She can gain up to ([[Essence]]) of the spirit’s [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]] for three motes each, as long as she meets their [[Essence]] minimums. She can also gain up to ([[Essence]] x3) dots of mutations based on the spirit’s appearance and power, committing one mote per dot.
The Abyssal can incur [[Experience Debt]] to permanently gain [[Charms]] or mutations gained this way.
She waives the experience cost of the first Charm she learns this way.
