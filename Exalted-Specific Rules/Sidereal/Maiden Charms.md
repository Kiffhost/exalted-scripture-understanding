Each Maiden has a set of associated non-Ability Charms.
That Maiden’s Chosen count them as Favored; others treat them as non-Favored. Maiden Charms count as belonging to their Maiden’s Abilities to meet prayer strip Charms’ prerequisites. Each Maiden Charm can only be used this way once; you can mark them with a * or other symbol on your character sheet to indicate when they’ve been used.
Maiden Charms’ prerequisites reference “(Caste) Charms.” These include the Charms of all that Caste’s Abilities as well as the Caste’s associated Maiden Charms. Likewise, Ability minimums that reference “(Caste) Abilities” mean that Caste’s Abilities.
Maiden Charms don’t count as belonging to any particular Ability for purposes of Ability restrictions unless specified otherwise.
