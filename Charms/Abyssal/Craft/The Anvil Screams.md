*The Abyssal pushes her craft to its very limit, drawing dark inspiration from past horrors.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a roll for a major, superior, or legendary project, adding a non-Charm success and rolling (Essence) non-Charm dice.
This Charm’s craft point cost depends on the kind of project enhanced: silver points for major, gold for superior, or white for legendary.
With Essence 3, the dice bonus increases to (Intelligence + Essence).
