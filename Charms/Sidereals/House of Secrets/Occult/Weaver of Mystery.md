The Sidereal spins threads of fate with her right hand and threads of sorcery with her left. The Sidereal flurries a Shape Sorcery action with a non-attack action, reducing the penalty on both rolls by one. If she knows Celestial Circle Sorcery, she negates the flurry penalty entirely, including the Defense penalty. An Occult 5, Essence 3 repurchase lets the Sidereal pay a four-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charmâ€™s duration to one scene.
