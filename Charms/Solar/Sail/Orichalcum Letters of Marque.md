The waters of Creation abound with the dark dross of Heaven’s judgment: galleys crewed by corpses, barges pulled by demons, and ships helmed by the Abyssal Exalted. Heaven recognizes the Lawgiver’s authority to recruit such creatures. This Charm upgrades the prerequisite, allowing the Solar to welcome residents of Malfeas and the Underworld, Abyssal Exalted and other cursed Chosen to the crew of her ship. While engaged in the operation of the Solar’s ship, such characters no longer count as creatures of darkness when targeted by social influence that would exploit this condition. In addition, while such characters may be deeply discomforted by the Solar’s anima, they are not driven to dematerialize, nor do they suffer any automatic damage from the Exalt’s iconic displays or area-effecting magic which would harm all creatures of darkness in the vicinity. In case of a mutiny, the Lawgiver may revoke this boon at any time. While her crew may be protected from social magic, this Charm provides no defense against attacks which harm cursed spirits and benighted creatures.
