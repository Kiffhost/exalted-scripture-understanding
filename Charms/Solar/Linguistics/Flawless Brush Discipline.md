The Solar concentrates all of her talent into a perfect expression of form. With this Charm, she may perfectly copy any written work down to the finest detail. Her flawless precision makes her script impossible to tell apart from the original, allowing her to create a perfect replica of a work. If the Exalt focuses intently on aesthetic elements, she may even use this Charm to copy them, flawlessly reproducing pictograms, illustrations and even maps. The Exalt may also forge signatures effortlessly, but cannot use this Charm to forge seals or other impressions affixed to a document. It is impossible to pierce this deception through normal means. Magic which can detect the Solar’s forgery must overcome a difficulty equal to the Solar’s (Linguistics + Essence) score at the time of writing.
