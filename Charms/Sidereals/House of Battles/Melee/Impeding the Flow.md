*Her weapon enfolded in wind and red stardust, the Sidereal turns aside unwanted fates.*
The Sidereal halves penalties to her [[Defense|Parry]], rounded down, including penalties from surprise attacks. If she benefits from a [[full defense]] or the attack rollâ€™s target number has been increased, she ignores all penalties instead.
