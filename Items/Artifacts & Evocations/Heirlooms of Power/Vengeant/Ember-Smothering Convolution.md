Spurred on to finish the grudge before Vengeant’s victim can escape, the wielder adds two bonus dice on a rush against a character she has a negative Tie towards. She gains one Initiative if she wins the rush. 

## Resonant

The wielder may pay an additional mote to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene against a despised opponent, enhancing all rushes she makes against him. She may stack multiple uses against multiple despised foes.
