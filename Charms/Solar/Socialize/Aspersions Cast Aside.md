*The Lawgiver is ever blameless.*
With this Charm she can cast aside all 1s and 2s after making a [[Socialize]] roll, forcing them onto a target within five feet. This target must then make a ([[Wits]] + [[Socialize]]) roll with a difficulty of the Solarâ€™s [[Essence]] to keep his composure, with foisted 2s replacing the lowest successes (typically 7s) and 1s replacing the next digit up (usually 8s). The Solar gains these successes to her initial roll, while her target appears to be the one who said something ridiculous, upset his wine cup into the gravy bowl, or so on. The Solar may use his Charm in response to another Solar using [[Aspersions Cast Aside]], but may not direct the impending botch back at the initiate.
