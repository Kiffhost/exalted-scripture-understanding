*The Solar speaks in such a magnetic and engaging fashion that those who can hear her become powerless to do anything but listen.*
Roll the Solar’s ([[Manipulation]] + [[Linguistics]]) with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes, ignoring the penalty for [[Social Influence#One Target vs. Many Targets|group influence]]. The Solar may not exploit targeted [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] to lower [[Resolve]], nor may [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] be invoked to raise [[Resolve]] against this effect. Those who fail their [[Resolve]] checks are entranced by the Solar’s voice and are held enraptured until she ceases speaking for more than a few seconds. Even characters who don’t understand the Solar’s language can succumb to this power. This Charm may also be used to ensnare and captivate a reader: if a character reads so much as a single line of writing reinforced with [[Unbreakable Fascination Method]], he must engage his [[Resolve]], and if he fails, he must continue reading what the Solar has written in its entirety, though this Charm may only hold a reader rapt for ([[Essence]]) minutes. This Charm may not be resisted with [[Willpower]]. [[Attack]] cancels the Charm, but only direct physical danger disrupts the effect. A brave or suicidal Exalt could keep a platoon of guards with her in a burning building until it was fully engulfed, but they would not stand there listening as the flaming timbers started crashing down around them.
