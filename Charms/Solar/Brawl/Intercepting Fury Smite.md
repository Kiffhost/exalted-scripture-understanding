As violence and destruction goes, the Solar is an artist and a savant. This Charm permanently enhances Force-Rending Strike; so long as she is wielding an improvised weapon for the clash, Force-Rending Strike’s cost is reduced to four motes, and the Willpower cost is dropped. Using Intercepting Fury Smite to succeed at a clash forces the Solar to discard her current weapon; it is either destroyed or dropped, forcing her to retrieve it or choose another.
