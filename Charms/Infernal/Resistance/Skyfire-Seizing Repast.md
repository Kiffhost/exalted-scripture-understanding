*The Infernal drinks in the Green Sun’s maddening light and the cosmic flames of Essence, drawing them inward to stoke the furnace of her soul.*

When an enemy makes a decisive attack against the Infernal, her attacker compares only his Initiative to her Hardness to determine if it prevents damage, without counting damage from other sources. If his attack’s damage roll doesn’t include his Initiative due to magic, he uses the lower of his damage dice or his actual Initiative.

Against attacks made up purely of Essence or other energy, like a Dragon-Blood’s elemental bolt, the Infernal also adds (Essence) to her Hardness, which can stack with other sources of Hardness. If her attacker overcomes her Hardness, she gains one mote for each level of damage she suffers, maximum (Essence).
