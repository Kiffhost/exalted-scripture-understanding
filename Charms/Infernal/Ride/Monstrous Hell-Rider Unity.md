*The Infernal and her steed ride as one, flesh liquefying and distorting as they merge into a single horrific chevalier.*

The Infernal fuses with her mount, becoming a single being. It no longer acts as an independent character, subsumed into the Infernal. She may set her Initiative equal to her mount’s if it’s higher than her own. This has the following effects:
- The Infernal retains all the benefits of being mounted in combat (Exalted, p. 202), including the mount’s Speed bonus and the ability to enhance her actions with Ride Charms.
- She can’t be unhorsed, and is immune to any other effects that rely on a mount and its rider being separate characters.
- She can use the mount’s base dice pools for physical actions, its Evasion and Defense, its soak and Hardness, and its effective Strength for feats of strength in place of her own if they’re higher. This counts as a bonus from Charms.
- The Infernal gains the mount’s natural weapons, using (Dexterity + Brawl) to attack with them unless the animal’s dice pool is higher. Even if she replaces her steed’s head as part of the fusion, she retains natural attacks — she could open a maw on her chest to make a bite attack, while her steed’s horns might manifest as growths from her arms.
- The Infernal gains the steed’s special abilities and Merits. Dice and successes added by them count as a bonus from Charms. However, she can’t use them together with her Charms or other magic on a single action: if both offer a benefit, she must choose one or the other. This doesn’t apply to her Permanent Charms.

The Infernal must pay a fifteen-mote surcharge to use this Charm with a Legendary Size mount. Doing so reduces this Charm’s duration to one hour. It’s still subject to the restriction on combining Charms with animal Merits.

This Charm can’t be used on sapient or supernatural mounts, except for Demon-Blooded animals and First Circle demons. The Infernal can use any Eclipse Charms a merged demon has and can draw from its mote pool to pay their costs.
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she enters [[Devil-Body]] while mounted, waiving its Willpower cost. If her [[Devil-Body]] has [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Infernal/Devil-Body Powers/Legendary Size|Legendary Size]], she also waives the surcharge for merging with Legendary Size mounts.
## [[Keys]]
#### Hybrid Titan Monstrosity (Essence 5)
When the Infernal merges with a Legendary Size mount, the surcharge is reduced to ten motes, and the Charm’s duration is only reduced to a day.
