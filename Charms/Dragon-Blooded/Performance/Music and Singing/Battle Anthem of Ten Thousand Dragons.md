The war-song of the Terrestrial Host has been passed down from mother to daughter for time immemorial, a battle hymn as ancient as the Divine Revolution. As long as the Dragon-Blood continues her musical performance with instruments or her voice, she and all allies that hear it gain a single bonus die on all attack rolls, combat movement, and command actions. Allied battle groups also add this bonus on rolls to resist rout. In addition, her and her allies’ successful withering attacks grant one bonus point of Initiative. If multiple characters use this Charm, these bonuses don’t stack. The Dragon-Blood can take other actions while continuing the performance by flurrying them with a miscellaneous action to continue performing.
