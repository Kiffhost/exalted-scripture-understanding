*The deathknight looses a bolt of crackling darkness from her outstretched palm.*
The Abyssal makes a withering or decisive attack with a bolt of necrotic energy, rolling ([[Dexterity]] + {Archery or Thrown}) against an enemy within medium range. It has the following traits:
 - The [[Accuracy]] of an artifact [[Archery]] weapon: Close −1; Short +5; Medium +3; Long +1; Extreme −1.
 - Damage (10 + [[Essence]])L. The Abyssal doesn’t add her [[Strength]] to its raw withering damage.
 - Overwhelming ([[Essence]] + 1).
 - It can be enhanced with either [[Archery]] or [[Thrown]] [[Charms]], but can’t combine [[Charms]] from multiple combat Abilities unless they’re explicitly compatible.
 - The bolt’s necrotic energies wither flesh and corrode metal. An enemy that takes decisive damage from a bolt suffers −1 soak and [[Hardness]] for the rest of the scene. This penalty stacks up to a maximum of −5. Mundane armor is destroyed if the penalty reaches the maximum.
