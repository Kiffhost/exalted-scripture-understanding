*Not satisfied with simply revealing the weakness of her enemy’s offense, the Sidereal counters his imperfect blow with a display of true excellence.*
The Sidereal reflexively clashes an attack with a decisive attack. She can even clash attacks against other characters, as per Instructive Riposte. If she does so and loses, the attacker can choose whether to direct the attack against her or his original target, as with defend other actions (Exalted, p. 196).
If the Sidereal has Instructive Riposte’s second purchase, she can use it with this Charm when she clashes an attack against another character.
