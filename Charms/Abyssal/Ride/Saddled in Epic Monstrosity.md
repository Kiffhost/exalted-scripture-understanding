*Finally, a steed worthy of Death’s Lawgiver.*
The Abyssal can pay a ten-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Wretched Ridden Nightmare]] to grant her steed additional benefits:
 - It gains Legendary [[Size]]. Mounts that already have Legendary [[Size]] grow even larger, extending their natural attacks’ range to short and requiring enemies within short range of them to disengage to move away.
 - It adds five dice on feats of strength and can attempt [[Strength]] 10 feats. If it could already do so, the added dice are converted to automatic successes and it adds +5 to its effective [[Strength]] for feats.
 - It gains (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3) temporary−4 health levels, which fade along with any damage they have taken when the transformation ends.
 - It adds (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3) to its withering attacks’ raw damage and Overwhelming.
 - It adds (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3) to its soak and [[Hardness]]. This stacks with other magic that grants [[Hardness]].
 - If the Abyssal has multiple purchases of [[Wretched Ridden Nightmare]], she can grant it up to six more dots of mutations chosen from those selected for them, letting her combine mutations from different purchases.
Legendary [[Size]] Legendary [[Size]] has the following benefits:
 - Smaller enemies’ attacks don’t inflict onslaught penalties. (Magically inflicted onslaught penalties still apply.)  - The character can’t be reduced below [[Initiative]] 1 by smaller enemies’ withering attacks unless they have 10+ post-soak damage dice. Such attacks still award the full amount of [[Initiative]] damage rolled.
 - The character can’t take more than (attacker’s [[Strength]] + 3) levels of damage from smaller enemies’ decisive attacks. Levels of damage added by magic don’t count against this limit.
 - The character can’t be grappled by smaller enemies unless they use magic like [[Titan-Murdering Grasp]]. Such magic is also necessary for them to resist her grapple control rolls.
 - The character can’t be knocked back by smaller foes’ smash attacks and is more difficult to knock back with magic (Exalted, p. 274).
