Ten thousand gentle crests can leave even the grandest groves of trees stunted and malformed, poisoned from the roots with the sea’s saltwater grief. When the wielder uses Still Waters Hide Fury against a despised character with whom she’s interacted socially in a previous scene, she may pay five motes and one Willpower to treat each such scene as a turn studying him from concealment, up to a maximum of (Essence) scenes. She makes a single (Manipulation + Stealth) roll against his (Perception + Awareness) for these past interactions, gaining (Essence/2, rounded up) Initiative for each scene on a successful roll. Failure doesn’t reveal her presence. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) by killing a despised character. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation.
