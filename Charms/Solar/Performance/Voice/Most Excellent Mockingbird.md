*Clearing away her senses, the Solar attunes herself to a single mimicry.*
For one scene, the Exalt can perfectly mimic a single person whom she could perfectly copy with the prerequisite. While this Charm is active she may still choose to speak with her own voice, and may use [[Cunning Mimicry Technique]] to mimic the voices of other characters.
