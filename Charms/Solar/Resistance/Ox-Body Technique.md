The bodies of the Exalted are much more durable than those of mere mortals. To help simulate this, an Exalt may buy extra health levels with this Charm. The purchasing choices are based on the character’s [[Stamina]] rating: At [[Stamina]] 1 and 2: One -1 and one -2 health level. 3 and 4: One -1 and two -2 health levels. 5: One -0, one -1, and one -2 health level. The Solar may purchase [[Ox-Body Technique]] ([[Resistance]]) times. If she increases her [[Stamina]] after purchasing [[Ox-Body Technique]], her health levels automatically change to reflect the new rating.
