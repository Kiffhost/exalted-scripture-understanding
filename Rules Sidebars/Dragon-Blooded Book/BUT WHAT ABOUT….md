# BUT [[WHAT]] ABOUT…?
The Elemental Aura flows from the intrinsic power of Dragon-Blooded [[Charms]]. [[Martial Arts]], [[Evocations]], and [[sorcery]] never impact the Dragon-Blood’s Aura either positively or negatively, even if they’re elemental in nature — they’re extrinsic power, a step removed from the core of Dragon-Blooded [[Essence]]. The one exception are the Immaculate martial arts (p. 286), styles uniquely designed to harmonize with the Elemental Aura.
