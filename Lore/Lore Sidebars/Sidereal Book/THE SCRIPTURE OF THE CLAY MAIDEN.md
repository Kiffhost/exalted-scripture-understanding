Once, there was a maiden…
...who made herself from the substance of the
world.
She knew how to eat an owl’s heart and gain its
insight.
She knew how to bake herself in the sun and melt
herself in the rain.
She knew how to mess up wisdom.
She knew how to love, and how to hate.
“Survival is flexibility,” she said.
