*The Infernal has transcended mortal ethics, a paragon of alien virtues at their uttermost extreme.*

Upon purchasing this Charm, the Infernal gains one of its keys, irrevocably altering her mind.
## [[Keys]]
#### Apex Being Assurance
Fear is no longer a meaningful concept for the Infernal. She gains +3 Resolve against fear-based influence and is immune to fear-based influence that isn’t enhanced by magic. She is incapable of having Intimacies based on fear, whether voluntarily or as a result of social influence. She must pay one Willpower to retreat, surrender, or otherwise avoid combat for any reason other than practical strategic concerns.
#### Greatest Good Benevolence
The Infernal’s empathy and compassion crystallize into something inhuman, caring for others not as individuals but as components of a greater whole. When she bolsters her Resolve with a positive Tie toward a group, an Intimacy reflecting compassion or benevolence on a broad scale, or a similar “greater good,” she ignores any Resolve penalties from positive Ties to individuals unless their Resolve is higher. She can act against positive Ties toward individuals without gaining Limit or suffering other consequences as long as doing so aligns with her Intimacy of greater good. However, she rolls two additional dice of Limit whenever she violates a “greater good” Intimacy.
#### Immutable Self-Concept Axiom
The Infernal’s unfaltering conviction in her beliefs, goals, and choices reaches inhuman extremes. She adds +3 Resolve against any influence that would weaken or alter one of her Intimacies, as well as Psyche effects that would cause her to gain Intimacies or alter her memories. However, she must spend one Willpower to violate one of her Major or Defining Intimacies, including by voluntarily weakening it.
#### World-Transcending Temperance
With extreme self-control comes absolute clarity of focus. The Infernal gains +3 Resolve against influence that is based on worldly pleasures and hedonistic desires, and influence that would cause her to act in an intemperate or unmannerly fashion. She also gains this bonus against Psyche effects that compel her to take actions or alter her perception. However, she must pay one Willpower to indulge in a worldly pleasure when she receives no concrete benefit from doing so. She’s incapable of having Intimacies based on enjoyment, hedonism, or desire.
