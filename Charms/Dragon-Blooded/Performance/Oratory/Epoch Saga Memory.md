The Dragon-Blood has eidetic recall of every story she’s heardbefore.Findingonewithinthedepthsofhermemories, she forces it to the surface. Her flawless recitation adds a non-Charm bonus success on a Performance roll made to tell that story, or any mental or social roll with another Ability that could benefit from her perfect recall of every detail of the story. Alternatively, she may add +1 Resolve against an influence roll contrary to that story’s moral, or +1 Guile against a roll by immersing herself in recollection, as a non-Charm bonus. Epoch Saga Memory can only be used once per day.
