The Sidereal wraps a long prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Hunted Maiden around her waist, where it transforms into a crystalline band of sky-blue Essence, binding herself to the world that they might evade calamity and strife together. The Sidereal can transport a landscape or community across Creation, reshaping both reality and the Celestial Bureaucracy’s records to make it as if it had always been there. When she uses this Charm, she chooses a region out to (Essence) miles from her, ensnaring all inhabitants, structures, habitations, natural features, demesnes and manses, and the landscape within her fate. She can’t pick and choose what to bring, nor can she bring something that doesn’t fall entirely within this range. This can’t transport unwilling nontrivial characters or their residences, nor can it move demesnes or manses if an attuned character’s player is unwilling. As the Sidereal moves, the region moves with her. She must travel under her own power, rendering this incompatible with mounts and sorcerous travel. Vehicles are also incompatible unless they’re self-propelled, like wheeled chairs. The region and its inhabitants exist at a remove from reality until they reach their destination; they’re visible, but outsiders can’t interact with without specialized magic. The prayer strip slowly tightens around her waist, inflicting one die of bashing damage each hour. Incapacitation from this isn’t fatal but ends the Charm, leaving the transported region wherever she fell. Once the Sidereal stops moving, the region is integrated into the world around her. It won’t destroy anything that was there originally: bringing a desert into a forest would cause the forest to recede enough to make room; dragging a village on top of another would blend their architecture together. Characters’ memories, maps and other documentation, and Heaven’s records are altered to reflect that the transported region has always been as its destination. This can be resisted like arcane fate (p. XX). Even destiny is revised, seamlessly accounting for the Sidereal’ changes (though she should expect to pick up her coworkers’ bar tabs for the foreseeable future if she uses this Charm frivolously.) Reset: Once per story unless reset by learning of a narratively relevant threat to an entire region.
