The killing speed of the wielder’s strikes is like a chilling wind,leavinghervictimstracedwithrimeandblood.This Evocation enhances a decisive attack. A damaged enemy is knocked prone and covered with a layer of thick frost that imposes a −3 penalty on his rolls to rise from prone (Exalted, 198). Even if no enemies are nearby, he must roll to shake off the frost and rise.
