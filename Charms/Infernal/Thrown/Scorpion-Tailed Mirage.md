*The Infernal stands adjacent to space itself as she lines up her throw, existing in many points to cut down all opposition with a single strike.*

The Infernal makes a single decisive attack against up to (Essence + 1) enemies. She divides her Initiative evenly among each hit enemy to determine the damage rolled against them. Battle groups and trivial characters aren’t included in dividing up her Initiative, but still suffer the same damage as other foes.

The Infernal flickers through multiple positions as she attacks, letting her treat herself as striking from whichever point is most advantageous to her for each individual enemy. This includes attacking from the opposite side of a barrier, allowing her to bypass even full cover. However, this doesn’t let her attack enemies beyond her weapon’s range. She remanifests in her original location after completing the attack.

If the Infernal uses this Charm while concealed, it doesn’t break her stealth as long as she doesn’t make any attacks from within close range of multiple enemies.
## [[Keys]]
#### Thousand Stings Torment
The Infernal can direct all of her attacks against a single enemy, though she must strike from a different position for each attack. She rolls separately for each attack, but doesn’t roll damage until after completing all of them. Each attack adds the target’s total onslaught penalty to its damage (e.g., if the Infernal’s target has a −3 onslaught penalty after her last attack, she would add three damage dice to each attack that hit).
#### Infinite Suffering Onslaught ([[#Thousand Stings Torment]]) (+5m, 2i)
When the Infernal uses [[#Thousand Stings Torment]] to strike a single foe, she can pay a five-mote, two-Initiative surcharge to make withering attacks instead of decisive attacks. She rolls damage separately for each attack that hits, but only after completing all attacks. The sequence ends prematurely if the Infernal misses an attack or crashes her target. Emptying a battle group’s Magnitude track ends it as well.
