The Lawgiver may pass down laws to her agents which are sacrosanct. The Solar repeatedly inveighs against a certain action, making it anathema. It then becomes impossible for members of her organization to carry out that action—but only in the context of functions of the bureaucracy. Furthermore, the Solar must be specific in citing those behaviors which are banned. Thus, she could not ban all theft, but she could ban “Theft from the company coffers” or “Embezzlement of client capital.” Likewise, while these bans would prevent members of her organization from stealing from her organization, they do not prevent those members from committing such crimes outside the jurisdiction of her organization. Characters affected by this Charm can treat any social influence to break a defined taboo as an unacceptable one. The Solar may stack this Charm (Essence) times to protect her organization thusly.
