*The Abyssal has eyes everywhere and nowhere, seeing all things through her agents, informants, and spies. How could any secret be kept from her?*
The Abyssal’s player reveals information previously supplied to her by her contacts, spy network, or other sources, rolling (Investigation + Investigation) to retroactively gather information on a case. This provides clues based on her successes, as with Unworldly Insight Revelation, but she’s not limited by the evidence available to her when determining what this can uncover.
The roll’s difficulty depends on the complexity of the Abyssal’s investigation and the evidence already available to her. Ferreting out a kingdom-spanning conspiracy with no evidence at all would be difficulty 10+, but it might fall to difficulty 7 after initial investigations turn up a lead or even to difficulty 3 if she secures a major collaborator’s confession.
