In the moment when fear’s cold fingers attempt to grasp the Exalt’s heart, she may draw upon her bond with [[Shining Ice Mirror]] to make her heart harder and colder than ice. Upon using this Evocaton, she raises her [[Resolve]] by one against an attempt to threaten, intimidate, overawe, or terrify her, and this does not count as a Charm bonus. However, all passionate Ties are lowered in intensity by one for the remainder of the scene. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no experience cost when the Solar uses [[Shining Ice Mirror]] to defeat an enemy that she holds an [[Intimacy]] of fear or awe for; or a significant enemy that has attempted to threaten or intimidate her, or attempted to subject her to supernatural fear or awe.
