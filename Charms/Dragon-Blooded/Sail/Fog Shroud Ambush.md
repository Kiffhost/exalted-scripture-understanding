Mist swirls around the Dragon-Blood’s ship as she maneuvers it out of sight, catching enemy ships off guard as she emerges from the fog. She waives the Momentum cost of a concealment stratagem in naval combat (Exalted, p. 245). If she succeeds and uses her next round to enact a broadside, escape, or ram stratagem against the enemy ship, she succeeds automatically, regardless of the opposing captain’s roll. If the opposing captain benefits from superhuman senses capable of seeing through fog or magic such as Eye of the Unconquered Sun, or is guided by an ally with such senses, the Dragon-Blood doesn’t automatically succeed, but imposes a penalty of (Manipulation) on opposing rolls. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully incapacitating an enemy ship with a naval stratagem.
