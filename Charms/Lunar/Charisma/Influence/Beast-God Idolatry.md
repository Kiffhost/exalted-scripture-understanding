The Lunarâ€™s spellbinding artistry beguiles those who gaze upon her works. Upon using any Attribute to craft an object that depicts herself or any shape she possesses, she imbues it with an influence roll to instill a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the depicted character, rolling ([[Charisma]] + [Craft or Linguistics]). A character viewing the object for the first time is exposed to this influence. This influence lingers in the object for ([[Essence]] + [[Charisma]]) days after this Charm ends.
