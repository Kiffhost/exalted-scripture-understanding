Spinning [[Essence]] silk to impossible fineness, the Exalt invisibly reinforces a fragile object or repairs a broken one. When using the Distaff’s threads for this purpose, the cost of the following [[Charms]] is reduced by two motes, and their effects treat her [[Essence]] as one higher: [[Durability-Enhancing Technique]], [[Crack-Mending Technique]], [[Object-Strengthening Touch]], ChaosResistance Preparation, and [[Breach-Healing Method]] (Exalted, pp. 294-296).
