*The Infernal’s attention is a divine blessing; that others should notice her is simply a given.*

The Infernal can tell when someone is watching her, even if she can’t perceive her observer, and senses whenever someone makes an active roll to observe or track her. She may choose to let that character’s roll succeed automatically, allowing her discern the distance and direction to the observer and doubling 9s on rolls to detect his presence, track him, or otherwise find his location for as long as he can perceive her. Entering concealment doesn’t end this bonus until the end of the scene.
