The Solar casts away her physical bonds and revels in dreams of dissolution and the whirling freedom of flight. Upon using this Charm, the Lawgiver begins to channel her anima into her flesh and must remain immobile until her next turn. During this time, her [[Defense|Evasion]] becomes inapplicable and her [[Defense|Parry]] suffers a -1 penalty. On her next turn, roll ([[Wits]] + [[Dodge]]) dice to create a number of temporary -0 Health Levels equal to the roll’s successes, paying one mote and one [[Initiative]] per Health Level. This roll cannot be enhanced by [[Dodge]] [[Charms]], and any Health Levels the Solar is unwilling or unable to buy are discarded. While using this Charm, a Solar who suffers damage solely to any of her -0 Health Levels is considered to have successfully dodged the attack even though the Health Levels are still checked off. A dodge created solely by [[Living Bonds Unburdened]] does not count as the use of a Charm. This Charm’s effect does not stack and may not be replenished until all of the created Health Levels have been damaged.
