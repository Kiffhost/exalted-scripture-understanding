*Touching Brazen Harvest to the ground unleashes an explosion of lush, inanimate growth, steaming with living heat and dripping saline afterbirth.*

The wielder expands Brazen Harvest’s transformation out to short range for an instant, creating an overgrowth of materials. Collecting it takes only a few minutes, and its Resources value is increased by one dot. If it’s used in a crafting project, the crafter gains an additional silver point per objective triggered for basic projects, or that many gold points for other projects.

Characters within the affected area increase the Resolve penalty of their Intimacies based on greed or a desire for violence by one. This property ends if the materials are harvested.
### Resonant
Once per day, the wielder may waive this Evocation’s Willpower cost.
### Dissonant
Using this Evocation requires a difficulty 3 ({Strength or Wits} + {applicable Craft}) roll, or difficulty 5 for precious materials.
## Reset
Once per scene. This can’t affect the same source more than once per month unless reset by killing a nontrivial character. out of greed or anger.
