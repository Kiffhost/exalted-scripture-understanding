Once, there was a maiden, weeping...
for she was traveling to a funeral in a far and sunless land.
Her clothes grew ragged on the road, and her hair grew gray,
but when she finally arrived, the door was locked.
So she shrugged off her skin for a raiment,
fashioned a harp from her bones,
poured out the wine of her veins,
and made feast of the meat of herself.
Finally unburdened, she went through the door,
for she was tired,
and the grave before her looked restful.
“I knew it couldn’t last forever,” she said.
