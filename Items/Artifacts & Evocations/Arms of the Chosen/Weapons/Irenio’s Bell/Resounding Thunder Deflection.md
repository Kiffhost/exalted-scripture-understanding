Irenio’s Bell transforms an enemy’s death-stroke into a peal of doom. When the Solar reduces a decisive attack’s damage to zero with Heavenly Guardian [[Defense]] (Exalted, p. 349), she can activate this Evocation to reflect the attack’s power as a wave of deafening clangor. She can spend Vibration equal to the total [[Initiative]] spent on Heavenly Guardian [[Defense]]. All opponents within short range take an onslaught penalty equal to Vibration spent, and suffer a −3 penalty to hearing-based [[Awareness]] rolls for the remainder of the scene. Targets must also roll ([Strength or Stamina] + [[Resistance]]) against a difficulty of the Vibration spent or be knocked prone. Those who fail by three or more successes are also knocked back one range band. Allied demons outside the blast are emboldened by the clangor, its alien note resonating in their bones. Each gains [[Initiative]] equal to the spent Vibration, up to the demon’s ([[Essence]]).
