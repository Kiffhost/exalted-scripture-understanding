The Sidereal sanctifies a ceremony in Heaven’s eyes, closing any loose ends in its fate. When the Sidereal participates in a ceremony or ritual — a wedding, a funeral, a banquet, a coming-of-age ritual, etc. — she rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) against a difficulty of (8 – ceremony’s [[Resources]] cost). If she succeeds, she blesses up to (1 + extra successes) other characters who participated in the ceremony. They can subsequently gain −1 target number on a roll related to the ceremony: rolling [[Medicine]] to care for a recently wedded spouse, [[Socialize]] to conduct negotiations over a banquet, etc. Their good fortune also has narrative manifestations: Newlyweds who wish for a child are much more likely to conceive, a dead man’s written will is fortuitously found, etc.
