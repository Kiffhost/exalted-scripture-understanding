*The deathknight garbs herself in the dark glamor of the sea.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses two of the attitudes below. The deathknight can commit two motes to embody one of those attitudes with [[Bleak Ocean Veteran]], rather than that of a seafarer. In addition to counting as an [[Intimacy]], the chosen attitude adds (Sail/2, rounded up) dice on certain influence rolls.
Alluring: The Abyssal is seen as a glamorous stranger, a traveler from far-off vistas, or a romantic hero of the sea. She’s a source of interest and gossip for all, drawing attention wherever she goes. This attitude enhances instill rolls to create or strengthen Ties of curiosity, desire, or obsession to the Abyssal.
Eminent: The Abyssal is seen as a wealthy merchant, foreign dignitary, or nobility in exile. She draws the eye of those who think they might gain political power, wealth, or prestige with her assistance. This attitude enhances bargain rolls to offer these things or to tempt people with decadent luxury.
Hallowed: The Abyssal is seen as an Underworldly ferryman, an envoy between the living and the dead.
Ghosts, occultists, and the bereaved seek out her wisdom and guidance, but her presence disquiets the living. This attitude enhances all influence rolls made to facilitate relations and mediate disputes between the living and the dead, whether between individuals or communities.
Vicious: The Abyssal is seen as a storied pirate, seasoned criminal, or fearsome raider. She receives a wide berth from the meek, and is sought after by scoundrels for patronage. This attitude enhances threaten rolls Additional attitudes can be purchased for three experience points or one bonus point.
