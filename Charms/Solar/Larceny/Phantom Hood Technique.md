*The Lawgiver can mask her anima to evade detection.*
Once per scene, the Exalt can activate this Charm to mute five peripheral motes in an instant, causing them to act as if they were motes spent from her personal mote pool, so long as the magic is aiding her in [[Larceny]]-based actions. This Charm is reset by a two point social stunt in which the Lawgiver uses [[Larceny]], or in which she uses subterfuge enhanced by any other social ability in order to aid her in criminal behavior. This reset must occur after the Charm has been used.
