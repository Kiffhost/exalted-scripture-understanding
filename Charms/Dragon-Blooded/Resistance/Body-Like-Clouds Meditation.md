The Dragon-Blood channels Air Essence throughout her body with circular breathing, lightening and dispersing her form to become all but untouchable. Withering damage rolls against her take a penalty of (Essence), which can reduce them below their minimum damage, minimum one die. If a withering attack hits her but deals no damage, she steals 2 Initiative from her attacker as he overextends, striking where sheâ€™s not.
