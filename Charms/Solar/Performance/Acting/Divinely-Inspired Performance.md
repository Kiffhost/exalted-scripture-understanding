By attuning herself to the Essence flowing between stage, actors, and audience, the Solar can inhabit a role completely. Upon activating this Charm, the Solar knows every line of a play she is acting in, without having read the script. She can divine the correct line and which character must speak it, just from listening to the dialogue. She also understands the exact emotion that needs to be evoked from any one response.

### On Divinely-Inspired Performance

This Charm models a Solar whose genius is so profound that she seems almost to be possessed by the author. She can fashion the perfect line — the exact correct line — just from listening to dialogue and interpreting cues. It’s not as if she has a magic teleprompter reading her the script, but rather that she becomes so completely immersed in the world of the play that she becomes the perfect avatar of her character.
