*As the deathknight and her alien masters have flensed away their old identities, so must her foe.*
If the Abyssal deals 3+ decisive damage, her enemy loses one [[Willpower]], plus an additional [[Willpower]] for each 10 on the damage roll, maximum (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3). For each point of [[Willpower]] he loses, one of his positive Intimacies is weakened by one step. Defining Intimacies can’t be affected unless the damage dealt exceeded the target’s base [[Resolve]]. The Abyssal can target specific Intimacies she’s aware of; otherwise, the [[Storyteller]] chooses. The victim may resist this by paying an additional [[Willpower]] for each [[Intimacy]] he wishes to preserve If this attack incapacitates the Abyssal’s victim or reduces his [[Willpower]] to zero, he loses all memories associated with any Intimacies that are completely eroded. If someone or something reminds him of an [[Intimacy]], he may pay three [[Willpower]] to regain his memories of it.
## Reset 
Once per scene. Once the Abyssal uses this Charm against a character, he’s immune to further uses for (his [[Resolve]]) days.
