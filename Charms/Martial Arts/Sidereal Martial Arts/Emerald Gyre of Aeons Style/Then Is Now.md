All things revolve through eternity’s gyre, but the stylist has learned to spin back history. The stylist rolls (Intelligence + Lore) to revert an inanimate object that fits within a single range band to a state it held in the past. If the object is being held, worn, or used by someone, this is a difficulty 3 unarmed gambit against him. The stylist can either revert the object to its condition at the time of a previous interaction she’s had with it or by a set amount of time. She could repair a broken weapon, revert a door to a time before it was locked, or revert an ancient skeleton to a fresh corpse to determine its cause of death. The difficulty of the roll depends on the amount of time unwound: difficulty 3 for up to a year, difficulty 5 for up to a decade, difficulty 7 for up to a century, or difficulty 10 for any amount of time. The difficulty can’t exceed the difficulty to destroy the object with a feat of demolition, at which point the stylist can revert the object to its constituent components before it was created. She can’t unmake artifacts, but she can revert them to damaged states. Enlightenment: Once per day, the stylist can use this Charm on an objects or structure that fit within three range bands.
