*Clearing her mind of all thoughts, the Solar focuses only on the arrow drawn back against her bowstring, feeling for the flow of [[Essence]] she needs to make an incredible shot.*
The Solar must take a special “long aim” action—an aim action lasting three rounds—against a single target in order to use this Charm. Invoking [[Seven Omens Shot]] converts the normal +3 bonus dice from aiming into three automatic non-Charm successes and adds any extra successes on the attack roll to the attack’s raw damage. 
[[Accuracy Without Distance]] can shorten the action by a single round, but may only add a single non-Charm success for each round shortened. Killing an opponent with this Charm awards the Solar one point of [[Willpower]].
