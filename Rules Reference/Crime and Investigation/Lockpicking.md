Picking locks or bypassing other mechanical security devices requires a successful (Dexterity + Larceny) roll. Most mundane locks have a base difficulty of 1-2. Those found in powerful manses or First Age ruins might range as high as difficulty 3 or 4. Lockpicks are an obvious necessity for this action. A character can attempt to make do with improvised tools or unorthodox picking methods, which adds +1 to the difficulty of the roll.
