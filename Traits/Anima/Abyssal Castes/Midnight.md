Midnight silences the world’s endless clamor, revealing the alluring beauty of the night as the sun lies dead. Hidden by the deepest of darkness, the dead conduct their forbidden rites. This, the Midnight Caste teaches, is the true face of death, a beauty unblemished by life’s imperfection. They Who Speak Blasphemous Truths preach death’s glory to the living, promising freedom from suffering in the embrace of the grave. Such is the Deathspeakers’ compassion that they will not rest until all have escaped from the meaningless lie that is life. Among the dead, they are bleak prophets and terrible god-kings, exerting their authority as Death’s Lawgivers.
The Children of Silence are skilled in swaying minds and subverting beliefs. They bend the wills of the living and the dead alike through fiery rhetoric, enthralling performances, or spiritual teachings. The ignorant and the foolish shun death’s perfection, and so the Echoes of the Abyssal must often conduct their dark rites in secret, employing all manner of subterfuge. They serve the Deathlords as evangelists, hierophants, and patrons of forbidden death-cults, spreading their masters’ bleak gospel through both the Underworld and Creation. Some Midnight Castes willingly seek out the Whispers of the Neverborn, seeking a deeper communion with the fallen titans.
Many Deathspeakers are chosen from those who have already embraced death in their mortal life: ancestor cultists, funerealists, denizens of shadowlands, morbid outcasts, and more. Others are chosen for their devotion and zeal: ascetics who fast unto death, willing martyrs, cultists who defy the suppression of their faith. Some Deathlords delight in choosing Midnight Castes from those whose faith has been broken, tempting monks to death’s service. 
Midnight Castes who defy their dread masters often embrace the mantle of Death’s Lawgiver. They might champion ancestor cults, speaking for the dead and rebuking their faithless descendants, or preach their own gospels of death. Others seek rulership, wresting kingdoms of the dead away from unworthy rulers and casting down decrepit regimes. Some scorn the Deathlords, but not their cause, becoming dark prophets of the Neverborn and leaders of apocalyptic cults.
# Anima Banner
Deathspeakers’ Caste Marks are dark reflections of the Zenith Caste’s, solid black discs that bleed from their edges. Most Midnight Castes’ anima banners are blacker than black, visible even in total darkness, though some are tinged with deep blues. It’s sometimes accompanied by eerie hymns, the murmuring of insects, or the cries of nocturnal predators, or by the scents of dead flowers, funereal incense, or burnt offerings.
# Anima Effects
- Death’s Master (10m [3m]; Simple; Instant): Invoking her dread authority, the Midnight binds a ghost to herself. She must touch him and roll (Intelligence + Occult) against its Resolve. If successful, he’s bound to her, and counts as her familiar (Exalted, p. 161). This doesn’t compel his obedience. She can summon the ghost to her reflexively for three motes, or banish it for free, returning it to its Underworld abode. She may bind up to (Essence) ghosts. 
- Prophet of the Void (5m; Supplemental; Instant; Mute): The Deathspeaker adds (higher of Essence or 3) non-Charm dice on an inspire, instill, or threaten roll. The undead count as having a Minor Intimacy supporting it, and she can influence even mindless undead. This power’s cost is waived at bonfire anima. 
- Wake From Death: (1m or 10m, 1wp; Simple; Instant): For one mote, the Midnight reanimates a corpse as a zombie (Exalted, p. 502). Once per day, she can spend ten motes, one Willpower to summon the ghost of someone who’s been dead no more than three days to his corpse. This doesn’t let her bind the ghost.
# Caste Abilities
As death-priests, subversive demagogues, and dread prophets of the Neverborn, Midnight Castes choose Caste Abilities from Integrity, Larceny, Linguistics, Lore, Performance, Presence, Resistance, and Survival.
#### ^Note:
The [[Martial Arts]] Ability cannot be chosen as Caste or Favored—instead, any character with [[Brawl]] as a chosen Caste or Favored Ability treats [[Martial Arts]] as Caste or Favored as well. A player may choose [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] as her [[Dawn]] Caste character’s Supernal Ability, but applies the benefits of that choice only to one or the other. Also, characters with [[Martial Arts]] dots must possess the [[Martial Artist]] Merit.
