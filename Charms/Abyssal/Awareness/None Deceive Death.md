*The living crave pleasant illusions, closing their eyes to the world’s sorrow, but the deathknight faces truth unblinkered and undaunted.*
The Abyssal experiences a moment of heightened awareness out to long range. She sees through the concealment of any hidden enemies within range, and likewise perfectly sees through disguises — even shapeshifting. Invisibility, magical silence, and the like are no impediment to her senses, and she can see through all forms of sensory illusion or other magic that distorts or impairs the senses, including Sidereals’ resplendent destinies.
While using Inhuman Perfection of (Sense), this Charm’s range extends an additional ([[Essence]]) bands of extreme range for the enhanced sense.
