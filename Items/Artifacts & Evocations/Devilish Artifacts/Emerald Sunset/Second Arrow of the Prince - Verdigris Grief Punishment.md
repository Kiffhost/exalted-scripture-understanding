*Emerald Sunset blazes with a forbidden sigil, endowing it with power over sorcery and demonkind.*

The wielder makes one of the following gambits.
### Banish Demon
The wielder can banish a demon back to Hell with a difficulty (demon’s Essence + 3) gambit. The banishment doesn’t take hold until the demon has taken (Circle) turns, vanishing at the end of the last one. This doesn’t work within Malfeas. This can only be used once per session, or once per scene against First Circle demons.
### Unbind Demon
The wielder can unbind a bound demon with a difficulty (binder’s Essence + 3) gambit. The demon is unleashed at the start of its next turn. He retains the Intimacy imposed by the binding, but it can now be eroded. This can only be used once per session, or once per scene against First Circle demons.
### Drain Sorcerous Motes
The wielder can target a sorcerer who’s shaping a spell with a difficulty (his Essence) gambit, causing him to lose (her Essence + {Archery or Occult}) sorcerous motes. If she rolls (spell’s Circle + 2) extra successes on the Initiative roll, he can’t cast that spell again for the rest of the scene, unless it was his control spell.
### Distort Sorcery
The wielder can distort an ongoing spell with a difficulty (sorcerer’s Essence + 3) gambit (Exalted, p. 466). She must make the gambit against a character affected by the spell, or against an effective defense of (sorcerer’s Essence + spell’s Circle) for other effects.

The wielder reduces a gambit’s difficulty by one if the attack benefits from aiming or she’s beaten her target’s Resolve with a threaten roll this scene.
### Resonant
The wielder can use [[First Arrow of the Prince - Baleful Sunset Glare]] with this Evocation, adding dice to its Initiative roll. A successful Initiative roll triggers the environmental hazard. The gambit’s effect applies to any characters damaged by the hazard who are valid targets if the wielder’s Initiative roll successes are sufficient. Demons damaged by the conflagration must pay a one-Willpower surcharge the next time they use a Charm this scene, while sorcerers must do so the next time they start shaping a spell.
### Dissonant
The wielder can’t banish or unbind Third Circle demons, nor can she distort or drain sorcerous motes from Solar Circle spells.
