The barding grants mount and rider resistance to fire. Each gains +4 soak and [[Hardness]] 4 against fire-based attacks, such as a firewand or the spell [[Flight of the Brilliant Raptor]], and subtracts one die of damage from fire-based [[environmental hazards]]. If this Evocation was used on the Exalt’s last turn, reduce its cost to one mote. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the rider isn’t dissonant with jade, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she attunes [[Carnelian Phoenix]]. 

## Resonant

This Evocation’s duration is one scene.
