*For some, a quiet, unassuming death is a kindness. For others, it’s a shame. Either way, the White Veil stylist allows them to experience it.*
She makes a decisive attack that exposes her victim to a supernatural disease if it hits. The cost of [[Birdsong Over Blades]] is waived when used with this attack. This disease, called the [[Subtle Mercy]] by White Veil masters, has virulence ([[Manipulation]] + 1), morbidity 5, and an interval of one day. This disease can kill characters with Exalted healing. In addition to the usual effects of disease (Exalted, p. 234), it has the following magical effects based on its intensity: Minor: The victim feels weary and lethargic, suffering a −1 fatigue penalty on all rolls unless he receives twelve hours of sleep each day. Rolls to diagnose the disease are made at +4 difficulty. Major: The victim’s fatigue penalty stacks by one each day he goes without twelve hours of sleep, maximum −5. In addition, he can no longer heal damage naturally (Exalted, p. 173) if he remains fully active during convalescence. Rolls to diagnose the disease are made at +3 difficulty. Defining: The victim now requires twenty hours of sleep to avoid suffering a fatigue penalty, as well to recover [[Willpower]] from a night’s sleep. Rolls to diagnose the disease are made at +2 difficulty.
