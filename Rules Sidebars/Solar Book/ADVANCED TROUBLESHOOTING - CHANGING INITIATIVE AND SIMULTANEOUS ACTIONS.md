Once [[Charms]] get into play, a character’s [[Initiative]] value can bounce up and down very quickly during a round. What if a character who has not yet taken her turn suddenly gains a great deal of [[Initiative]], and finds herself with a higher [[Initiative]] value than other characters who have already taken their turns? What if this [[Initiative]] value is higher than the current tick the round is moving through? 

Characters cannot be forced to miss out on taking a turn during a round because of situations like this. If a character’s [[Initiative]] suddenly changes in such a way that it indicates she should have already taken her turn, she takes her turn on the following tick. 

Finally, what if two characters act on the same tick and it becomes important to determine whose action resolves first, as in the case of two characters both attacking the same opponent, and both Crashing him simultaneously? They can’t both get an [[Initiative]] Break bonus—so who attacked first? If one player wants to allow the other to go first, then he gets to do so. If both players want to act first, flip a coin or have each simultaneously acting player roll a die to break the tie.
