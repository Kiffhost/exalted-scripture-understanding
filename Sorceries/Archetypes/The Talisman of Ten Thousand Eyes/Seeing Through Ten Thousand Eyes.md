The sorcerer may hone her senses through the talisman to open her inner eye, paying a point of Willpower whenever she makes an Awareness roll to Join Battle or notice a hidden threat while wearing the talisman. She gains one sorcerous mote for every two successes on this roll. These motes last for the duration of the scene, and can be spent towards any spell she casts. If she is joining battle against or searching out malevolent sorcerous forces—enemy sorcerers, bound demons, strange beings created by sorcery—she also adds her Occult in bonus dice to the roll.
