*Apocalyptic darkness envelops the deathknight, leaving her a howling void of violence, a shadow cast against the world.*
The Abyssal gain the following benefits:
 - Her unarmed attacks are limned with the annihilating darkness of the void. They count as artifact weapons when used with [[Brawl]], deal aggravated damage, and ignore [[Hardness]].
 - Enemies with Ties of fear toward her suffer a –([[Intimacy]]) penalty on attack rolls against her.
 - Once per round, she can pay one [[Willpower]] or five [[Initiative]] to clash an attack made against her with a special ([[Stamina]] + [[Brawl]]) decisive attack. If she wins the clash against an enemy at close range, he suffers (Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + attack roll extra successes) dice of aggravated damage, ignoring [[Hardness]].
This doesn’t include the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]] or reset it. Against ranged attacks, winning the clash provides no benefit beyond blocking the attack.
 - She can’t be reduced below [[Initiative]] 1 by attacks made from beyond close range.
 - When using magic that provides increased benefits based on how high her wound penalty is, her overflowing necrotic [[Essence]] lets her count as having a −5 base wound penalty when it’s advantageous to her.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses [[Dark Messiah’s Wrath]] together with this Charm, she waives that Charm’s cost and doesn’t suffer its [[Defense]] penalty.
