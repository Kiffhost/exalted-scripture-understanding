*Finally, a steed worthy of Death’s Lawgiver.*
The Abyssal can pay a ten-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Wretched Ridden Nightmare to grant her steed additional benefits
- It gains Legendary Size. Mounts that already have Legendary Size grow even larger, extending their natural attacks’ range to short and requiring enemies within short range of them to disengage to move away.
- It adds five dice on feats of strength and can attempt Strength 10 feats. If it could already do so, the added dice are converted to automatic successes, and it adds +5 to its effective Strength for feats.
- It gains (higher of Abyssal’s Essence or 3) temporary−4 health levels, which fade along with any damage they have taken when the transformation ends.
- It adds (higher of Abyssal’s Essence or 3) to its withering attacks’ raw damage and Overwhelming.
- It adds (higher of Abyssal’s Essence or 3) to its soak and Hardness. This stacks with other magic that grants Hardness.
- If the Abyssal has multiple purchases of Wretched Ridden Nightmare, she can grant it up to six more dots of mutations chosen from those selected for them, letting her combine mutations from different purchases.
