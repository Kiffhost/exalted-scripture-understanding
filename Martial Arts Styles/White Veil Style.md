# [[White Veil Style]]
There is no White Veil Society. It’s not a loose-knit association of martial artists, spies, and assassins spread throughout the Realm and beyond. Its members don’t practice a deadly martial art, nor has this style ever spread to students willing to pay vast sums for secret instruction or to rival martial artists who haven’t uncovered records of its secret techniques. It never sees use at dinners, salons, and galas. People don’t die from it, occasionally silently and occasionally screaming, days or weeks after not encountering it. 
## Weapons
If it existed, White Veil would use swift, precise unarmed attacks to strike pressure points, as well as garrotes and hand needles.
## Armour
This style would be incompatible with armor if it were real. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Socialize]] and [[Stealth]] are essential to the modus operandi that isn’t employed by masters of this nonexistent style.
