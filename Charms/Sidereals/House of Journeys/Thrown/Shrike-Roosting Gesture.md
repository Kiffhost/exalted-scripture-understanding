*The Sidereal tugs at a strand of fate that tethers her to something she’s recently held, calling it to hand.*
The Sidereal recalls to her hand an object that she’s held or had on her person at some point in the scene.
If there’s any obstacle to this, she rolls (Wits + Thrown) against a difficulty set by the Storyteller or a character’s opposing (Attribute + Ability) roll. The Sidereal must have a free hand to catch the object to use this Charm.
This Charm costs only one mote when used to retrieve a Thrown weapon.
