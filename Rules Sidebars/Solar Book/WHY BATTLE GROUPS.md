Lone heroes fighting many times their number in nameless lackeys is a staple of many of the sources Exalted draws on. Additionally, because of the scope of martial conflicts often present in Exalted, it’s impractical to depict each soldier in a war scene individually. Battle groups satisfy the demands of both huge-scale mass combat scenes and more modestly scaled scenes where the heroes smash up two dozen thugs in a furious display of their martial prowess.

The astute may wonder if it wouldn’t be more useful to divide, say, a Size 5 group up into ten Size 3 groups, netting ten attacks per round instead of one stronger attack. However, battle groups are a gameplay abstraction, and military minds within the world of Exalted don’t plan wars around the battle groups system. Battle groups are there to reduce the Storyteller’s workload, and splitting 1,000 soldiers (one thing for the Storyteller to keep track of) into ten 100-fighter groups (10 things for the Storyteller to keep track of) defeats that purpose.

The only time similar mobs of fighters should be represented as separate battle groups is if they are so widely separated geographically (two units of infantry fighting at opposite ends of a mile-long valley) that it becomes impractical and implausible to combine them. Otherwise, don’t split battle groups into smaller units for greater offensive power.
