The bearer of this cat’s-eye gem can conjure a blazing electric-blue eye from inside the stone. It moves as she directs, and she sees through it as if it were her own. The magic eye is immaterial and incapable of attacking; uses the Exalt’s Join Battle, combat movement and Evasion; and has (Essence) soak and Hardness, and one health level. It can’t travel more than one mile from the stone.
