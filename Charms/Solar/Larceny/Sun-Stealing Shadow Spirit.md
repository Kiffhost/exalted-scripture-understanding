*No fortress is impregnable to one of the [[Solar Exalted]].*
Through continuous observation of movement and interactions around a specific location, the Solar becomes supernaturally aware of flaws in a pattern of security. She might notice an unlocked window or door, a guard who leaves his post at a certain time every night, a secret entrance, a pattern in security patrols, and so on. She can complete ([[Essence]]) weeks of observation in (difficulty x 10) minutes; flows of [[Essence]] show her snarls in the order of day to day operations, such that she can know a daily pattern after only having been present for just minutes. Roll the Solar’s [[Perception]] + [[Larceny]] with a difficulty based on the size and tightness of security, with an undefended shop rating difficulty 1, a merchant prince’s mansion rating difficulty 3, and the Imperial Treasury rating difficulty 6. The difficulty of this roll can be lowered with appropriately stunted [[Awareness]] [[Charms]]. If successful, the Lawgiver can introduce one fact about a weakness in the location’s security, and for every additional two successes she may name another factual security weakness, place of concealment, or other means of gaining surreptitious access to a place. Unlike [[introducing a fact]] with [[Lore]], if the Solar beats the set difficulty, the Storyteller should always allow whatever fact the player introduces. If the Storyteller deems there are absolutely no flaws, the difficulty should be set to 10 and if the Solar jumps this hurdle then they still find at least one flaw. 

## Special activation rules

By spending six points accrued by [[Master Plan Meditation]], this Charm may be used retroactively, without a roll and for free, allowing the Solar to declare away a guard that’s just caught her, a trap that’s just sprung on her, a hiding place that wasn’t there before, and so on. She may only introduce a single fact in this fashion.

### On [[Sun-Stealing Shadow Spirit]]

I badly wanted to do a Charm that would allow the Solar to effectively case a location using [[Larceny]], but my initial try at it way back in 2013 was unworkable. Conversely, I came up with this mechanic as an after thought while putting in bonus [[Charms]]. Oh the changes wrought by time and experience.
