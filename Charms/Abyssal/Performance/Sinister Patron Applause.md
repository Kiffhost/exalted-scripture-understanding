*Think wisely before accepting the Abyssal’s patronage.*
While using Morbid Fascination Style on another character’s performance, the Abyssal can spend one Willpower to add (her Appearance) non-Charm dice on that character’s roll and grant it the effect of Culture-Reinforcing Overture. The performer automatically gains the Intimacy instilled by it unless he spends one Willpower to resist, but doing so denies him this Charm’s benefits.
This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived if its target is performing the Abyssal’s own work — playing music composed by her, putting on one of her plays, etc.
With an Essence 3 repurchase, the Abyssal may use her own Reflexive and Supplemental Charms to enhance a performer’s roll. However, she can’t combine them with any magic he uses — his player must pick one or the other. If she spends any Willpower doing so, each point spent increases the Willpower cost to resist by one, maximum (higher of Essence or 3).
