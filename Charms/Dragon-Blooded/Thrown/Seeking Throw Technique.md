The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s hostile intent stirs up a current of wind that guides her weapon to its victim. A thrown knife might change trajectory in midair to strike an enemy hidden behind a tree, wall, or similar cover. She may add bonus dice on a [[Thrown]] roll for one mote each, and ignores the [[Defense]] bonus of enemies in light cover. In Air Aura, if the Dragon-Blood aims before attacking, she may ignore one point of [[Defense]] bonus from heavy cover.
