*The Abyssal preacher’s words spread through the community, each congregant another spark.*
When the Abyssal makes an inspire roll to spread negative emotions, affected characters gain a pool of bonus dice equal to the Abyssal’s extra successes against them. She can also use this Charm on instill rolls to create or strengthen negative Principles or Principles related to death.
Bonus dice granted by this Charm can be spent on rolls to repeat the Abyssal’s influence. If a roll enhanced by these dice succeeds, its targets are affected as above. They’re lost if not used within (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) days.
This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if it’s used with another Charm that costs [[Willpower]].
