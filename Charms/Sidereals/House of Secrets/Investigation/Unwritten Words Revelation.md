*What the Sidereal reads is not always what’s written; missives, poems, and books reveal their writer’s secrets to aid in her investigation.*
After reading a book, letter, or other writing, the Sidereal makes a special ([[Perception]] + [[Investigation]]) read intentions roll against its writer’s [[Guile]]. Success reveals a relevant and useful fact about the writing of the work, plus an additional such fact for every three extra successes: where it was drafted, the writer’s emotional state when he wrote it, who else was present when it was written, etc. If the text conveys written influence, she can use her successes on this roll in place of her [[Resolve]]. With an [[Investigation]] 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, this Charm can be used against any object or artificial structure, not just writing.
