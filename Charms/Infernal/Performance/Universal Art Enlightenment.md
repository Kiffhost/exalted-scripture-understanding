*There is but one art. Mortals know it by many names and forms, but the Infernal knows the secrets of those who first sang the music of the spheres.*

The Infernal can pay a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses a Simple Performance Charm that’s specific to one kind of performance, letting her use it through any form of performance. For example, she might perform the Battle Anthem of the Infernal Exalted through dance instead of song.

This Charm’s Willpower surcharge is waived if the Infernal uses it with a Charm that has a Willpower cost.
