The Dragon-Blood blurs through the air, descending on her foe in a mighty bound. To use this Charm, she must either move into close range with an enemy by leaping and attack him on the same turn, or reflexively pursue him by leaping with a rush and then attack on her next turn. She adds ([[Essence]]) bonus dice on the attack roll, and adds an automatic success on a withering damage roll or a bonus die on a decisive damage roll.
