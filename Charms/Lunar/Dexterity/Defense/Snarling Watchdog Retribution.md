Any fool with temerity enough to come between the Lunar and her ward must face a divine guardian-beast’s unleashed fury. To use this Charm, the Lunar must have [[Initiative]] 10+. When an enemy attacks a character protected by her defend other action, she makes a decisive counterattack, adding her ward’s [[Initiative]] to her own to determine damage. A successful attack resets her [[Initiative]], but not her ward’s.
