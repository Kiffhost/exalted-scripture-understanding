*The guilty cannot hide their secrets from the deathknight’s gaze.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses one of its two techniques: Cunning Scrutiny Style, which enhances case scene rolls, or GuiltSensing Eye, which enhances profile character rolls.
Each technique lets the Abyssal add (Essence) successes and doubling 9s on its respective action’s roll and complete the action in a handful of seconds.
The Abyssal can repurchase this Charm to learn the second technique.
