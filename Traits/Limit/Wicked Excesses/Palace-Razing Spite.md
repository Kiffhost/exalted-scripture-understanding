Why should there be any beauty in the world, while the Infernal is denied her just rewards? She sets out to destroy a precious thing, burning a holy temple, crushing a beautiful jewel, slaying a sacred beast. Why it is valued does not matter, all that matters is that the Infernal wishes to deny that value to others. If there is nothing sufficiently precious to satisfy her ire, she can settle for multiple lesser targets, such as defacing every statue in a Great Forks street or spearing every rare carp in an ornamental lake.

**Duration**: Scene.
Palace-Razing Spite can end prematurely if another would benefit from her destructive act.
