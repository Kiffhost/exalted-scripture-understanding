The Terrestrial takes on a defensive stance that emulates the snarled branches of a forest, or a beautiful flower’s blossom. Each round, she may ignore up to ([[Essence]]) points of onslaught penalty to her Parry. She may divide this among multiple attacks in a round, as long as she ignores no more than ([[Essence]]) total points of penalty in a single round. In Wood Aura, the Dragon-Blood doesn’t take onslaught penalties from attacks she successfully parries.
