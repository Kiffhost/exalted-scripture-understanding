*Striking at thin air, the Sidereal spread ripples of violence across the battlefield and leaves it to her foes to determine who is struck.*
The Sidereal rolls a single unblockable withering attack against all enemies within short range, making a separate damage roll against each hit enemy. This ignores all cover, even full cover. Before the damage rolls are made, players may opt to avoid taking damage, starting with the one whose character faces the most damage dice and going in order. If a player opts out, his character suffers no damage, but the Sidereal gains (her [[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] and adds half the damage dice he faced, rounded up, to her roll against each other character. If only one enemy remains, he canâ€™t opt out. The Sidereal gains [[Initiative]] normally from the highest damage roll. Other damage rolls award up to (her [[Essence]]) [[Initiative]]. She still gains the full [[Initiative]] for hitting and crashing enemies. 
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by dealing 8+ levels of decisive damage to a nontrivial enemy.
