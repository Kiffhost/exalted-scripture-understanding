*Even if a centipede is cut in half, it continues to wriggle and move about; with this persistence, the stylist pushes her well-honed body through injury and exhaustion.* 
She ignores (Athletics) points of wound, crippling, or fatigue penalties on attacks, grapple control rolls, movement actions, and Evasion for one tick. If she isn’t suffering any such penalties (or has otherwise negated them), she adds (Athletics/2, rounded up) dice on withering damage rolls and grapple control rolls. 
## Terrestrial
The stylist doesn’t ignore Evasion penalties.
