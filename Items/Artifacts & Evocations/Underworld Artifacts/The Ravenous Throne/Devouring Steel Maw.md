*Ensnared in the throneâ€™s claws, its mewling victims are dragged into the massive, spiked maw beneath.*
When the throne makes a decisive savaging attack, it doubles 9s on the damage roll and adds damage dice equal to its current rounds of control, maximum 5.
## Dissonant
The attack only doubles 10s on the damage roll.
