The Lunar’s dreadful mien evokes unfathomable horror, the face of every monster her victim has ever imagined. And then, when she’s gone, he sees that awful visage still, leering at him from high in the trees, from dark alleyways, in the faces of his wife and children. The Lunar makes an ([[Appearance]] + [[Presence]]) threaten roll with (current temporary [[Willpower]]) bonus dice against one character with a Tie of fear toward her (or her current shape). If successful, she also inflicts the Paranoia [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 169), with an intensity equal to that of his Tie to her, even if he resists with [[Willpower]]. Subsequently, the first time he’s unable to perceive the Lunar, he must roll [[Willpower]] against that [[Derangement]], fearing she could be anywhere. The victim’s paranoia centers around the Lunar, causing him to see her hiding in every shadow or wearing his friends’ and families’ faces. Each time he fails a [[Willpower]] roll against the [[Derangement]], the Storyteller chooses one of his positive Ties to erode by one step, beginning with Minor Ties and working up, as his ability to trust others is poisoned by his dread certainty that they could be just another disguise for the Lunar. Once all such Ties are gone, subsequent failures create or strengthen a Principle of “I’m never safe.” The Lunar’s victim must pay two [[Willpower]] each time he wishes to voluntarily erode his Tie of fear toward her. [[Influence]] rolls to weaken that Tie face the rules for overturning influence. If the victim fully erodes this Tie, he may begin eroding the [[Derangement]] at a rate of one level of intensity each month, paying three [[Willpower]] each time he does so. This Charm can only be used against a character once per story.
