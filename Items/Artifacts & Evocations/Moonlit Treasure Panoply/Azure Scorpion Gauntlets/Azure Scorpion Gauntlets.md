Most of Katja Narrow-Pupils’ peers in the Old Realm saw her as a brilliant but eccentric alchemist. She kept a poison garden the size of a forest, raised beasts of resplendent liquids bred to yield exotic toxins, and wore venomous insects as jewelry on the floor of the Deliberative. Few suspected that the soft-spoken genius was among the First Age’s deadliest poisoners. Katja chose her victims carefully, each death the antidote to some infirmity she saw in the Old Realm.
In time, Katja’s crimes were discovered by a Sidereal named Crucible Knife, part of the growing conspiracy behind the Usurpation. Instead of confronting her, he sought her out as an ally, arguing for the necessity of his cause. Katja found his rationale compelling. She too had seen horrors born of Exalted folly or hubris, symptoms of a disease beyond her power to cure. Crucible Knife gave Katja the Azure Scorpion Gauntlets to seal their alliance, forged by one of Luna’s divine descendants to imprison Smiling Yathe, a cruel and mocking scorpion-spirit.
The warlord Endless Echo succumbed to a feast laced with Yozi venom. Lanovan of Ket, an Eclipse Caste diplomat, caught her prowling his manse’s halls, but fell to the Azure Scorpion Gauntlets. But Bear the Lefthander, forewarned by a traitor among the Sidereals’ ranks, was prepared for Katja. She fell to his daiklave, but the poison from the single strike she landed left him weakened when the Sapphire Pentacle Hearth came to strike him down three days later.
Katja was buried alongside the Azure Scorpion Gauntlets, but the Sidereals retrieved the gauntlets and returned them to Heaven’s vaults. The Gold Faction has sometimes sought to use them as a gift or bargaining chip with the Silver Pact, but to little avail. The Pact’s elders have no desire for the weapon of a reviled traitor, nor for the wrathful thing that haunts them. But not all in the Pact heed their elders’ warnings, and Sidereals have ample reason to work with Lunars independent of the Pact as well.
The gauntlets are made of blue-tinted moonsilver, their design reminiscent of a scorpion’s carapace, while their long blades resemble stylized stingers. The gauntlets’ wielder can launch these blades, extending chains of moonsilver behind them as they fly toward distant foes.
Smiling Yathe is a silent presence within the gauntlet, though his malice is at times palpable within its Essence. Some wielders have forged a deeper bond with him, communing with him to seek his counsel. Yathe saw Katja as a kindred soul — something the principled assassin disputed fiercely — and judges the gauntlets’ wielders in comparison to her. 
 
## Evocations of Azure Scorpion Gauntlets

The gauntlets’ Evocations center on the ability to fire its blades, using them both in and out of battle for a variety of purposes. They also draw on both Katja’s and Smiling Yathe’s associations with poison. Other Evocations let the wielder communicate directly with Yathe, or even manifest him to fight by their side.
The gauntlets’ blades can be used to make Thrown attacks out to medium range. They’re exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) when used as a grappling hook or for similar purposes. The wielder can reflexively withdraw the blades, concealing the gauntlets’ nature as a weapon, or extend them.
