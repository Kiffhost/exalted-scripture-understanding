The darkness quails and cowers as the sun’s first rays illuminate the world. The scuttling horrors of the night flee in the face of the dawn, retreating to those few places its light doesn’t touch. This will not save them from the Dawn Caste, whose arrows, blades, and fists are as relentless as the rising sun. Peerless warriors one and all, these Solars exemplify martial might, taking battle with them wherever they go. They leave behind fields soaked with the blood of their enemies, red as sunrise. 

In the First Age, the Dawn Caste served as the Old Realm’s warriors, champions, and generals. They led its armies against all enemies—horrors of the Wyld, monsters from the Underworld, behemoths left behind by the enemies of the gods, and even the might of the Undersea. Their martial prowess kept the Realm and its peoples safe for countless centuries. During the Usurpation, the Bronze Tigers unleashed their terrifying might on the Dragon-Blooded, turning well-planned ambushes into slaughter. None of them went to their graves peacefully, and some of their restless shades haunt the Underworld to this day. 

Creation’s greatest warriors have returned to a world of strife, ready and eager to test their mettle. Whatever their choice of arms, the Solars of the Dawn Caste are triumphant masters—many of them are military polymaths, achieving brilliance in multiple styles of combat. On the battlefield, the Spears of Morning are engines of destruction, beautiful and terrible to behold. Not all lead troops into battle, but those who do turn their men into soldiers worthy of the Sun. 

Most Dawns were warriors long before their Exaltation, but some have been drawn to war in other ways. For every career soldier or seasoned mercenary, there’s a young farm girl who took up a blade to defend her home. A Dawn is generally the most skilled combatant in a Solar Circle, protecting his Circlemates and leading them in battle. If a situation requires force, the Dawn Caste can deliver. 

# Anima Banner

The Caste Mark of the Dawn is an eightpointed sunburst of purest gold, gleaming on the brow. Dawn Caste anima banners are often pale gold or white, tinged with rose red and subtle violet hues—the colors of the sunrise. 

# Anima Effects

The Unconquered Sun stood as the warleader of the gods in antiquity, and his ferocity lives in the Essence of every Dawn Caste, sharpening their already-formidable battle prowess to an unmatched edge. See page 175 for details. 
- At bonfire/iconic anima display, the Dawn adds half her Essence score (round up) to her base Initiative upon resetting to base after a successful decisive attack.
- For 10 motes, all of the Dawn’s combat and movement Charms with outstanding reset conditions are automatically reset. This effect can only be used once per day, becoming available again at sunrise.
- The Dawn Caste inspires terror in her foes. She adds half her Essence score (round up) in dice to all intimidating social influence. She may also intimidate targets which do not feel fear, such as automatons, golems, and certain undead.

# Caste Abilities

As befits such peerless masters of combat, the Swords of Heaven show talent for Archery, [[Awareness]], Brawl/Martial Arts[^], [[Dodge]], Melee, Resistance, Thrown, and War. 
#### ^Note:
The Martial Arts Ability cannot be chosen as Caste or Favored—instead, any character with Brawl as a chosen Caste or Favored Ability treats Martial Arts as Caste or Favored as well. A player may choose Brawl or Martial Arts as her Dawn Caste character’s Supernal Ability, but applies the benefits of that choice only to one or the other. Also, characters with Martial Arts dots must possess the Martial Artist Merit.
