The Imperial trireme exists for one purpose alone: to kill other ships. All mount reinforced rams on their prow, and while they are capable of sailing, they deploy a bank of 100 oars in combat, giving them unmatched maneuverability. The triremeâ€™s standard tactic is to smash into the enemy and then disgorge its marines. Having no cargo capacity to speak of, and being unsuited for surviving violent storms, triremes deployed beyond coastal waters travel in the company of enormous supply ships known as trireme tenders, which keep them provisioned with food, water, and a place to safely tie up during dangerous weather.
