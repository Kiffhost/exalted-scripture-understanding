*As battle breaks out, the Nightingale raise her voice in a song that promises triumph, steeling the hearts of her allies so that they may fight more fiercely.*
[[Inspiring Battle Hymn]] rerolls all 1s on the [[Join Battle]] roll of the martial artist and all allies capable of hearing her. Characters who received this benefit add +1 [[Resolve]] against threats, supernatural fear, or similar forms of influence for the duration of the fight. 
## Mastery
If the martial artist wins [[Join Battle]], she may gain a single point of temporary [[Willpower]], or grant it to an ally who also won [[Join Battle]]. This can raise characters above their permanent [[Willpower]].
