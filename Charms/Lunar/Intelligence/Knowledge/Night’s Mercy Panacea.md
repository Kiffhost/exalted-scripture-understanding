*!!Drawingonherunderstandingoftoxinsandpestilence,!! the Lunar formulates efficacious cures.*
She doubles 9s to treat a poison or disease (Exalted, pp. 236-237) she’s successfully diagnosed. If her treatment is based on a fact she’s introduced regarding that malady, she adds ([[Lore]]) non-Charm dice. With [[Intelligence]] 5, the Lunar may pay a five-mote surcharge to double 8s. With [[Intelligence]] 5, [[Essence]] 4, the Lunar may pay a six-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to double 7s.
