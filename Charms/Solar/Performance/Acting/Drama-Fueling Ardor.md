When acting in a play, the Solar’s energetic charisma and sexual energy is almost palpable. This Charm supplements a Performance roll when play-acting, adding one automatic success. In addition, this Charm mutes the (highest of [Essence] or three) peripheral motes used on that tick, whiletakinganysuccessesovertheaverageaudiencemember’s Resolve (or Guile if applicable) and awarding them to the person acting opposite the Solar, to be used as nonCharm dice for their next Performance roll. Characters thus enhanced feed off the Solar’s energy, enhancing their own acting. The Solar’s fellow actors experience this not as an infusion of “good acting magic” but rather feel the Solar inhabits the soul of the character she is playing, reads the audience perfectly, and puts on a performance of such magnitude that they themselves are elevated. If such a character’s acting is particularly well received after critics review their performance, they will generate an appropriate Intimacy for the Solar, such as awed respect for her talent, or adoration for the Solar herself. Lastly, any 9s or 10s on the enhanced roll by the actor opposite the Solar restore an equal number of motes to the Solar.

### On Drama-Fueling Ardor

Another case of not having enough room in the core book. I really wanted to explore the thespian arm of the Performance tree, but there was simply no room. Here we have a Charm that gets something interesting started, and helps ingratiate you to your acting troupe. The muting effect helps the Solar pour everything into her performance. A Solar who uses this Charm leaves her heart on the stage.
