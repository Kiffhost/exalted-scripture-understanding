*The Sidereal conceals the threads of her companions’ fates within the constellation she stands under, subsuming them into her resplendent destiny.*
The Sidereal extends her resplendent destiny to her Circlemates and up to (Essence + 1) other willing characters, giving them a semblance suitable for companions of that resplendent destiny’s role and the usual benefits of a resplendent destiny (p. 142). Unlike the Sidereal, her companions don’t risk provoking cover checks; the peripheral roles they play need not hold up to the same level of scrutiny.
If multiple characters under a destiny make disguise rolls that benefit from it simultaneously, they can all use the highest roll among them. In places concealed by Privacy-Enhancing Gesture, that Charm’s target number increase applies to rolls against such disguises.
Rolls not enhanced by superhuman senses or magic automatically fail.
