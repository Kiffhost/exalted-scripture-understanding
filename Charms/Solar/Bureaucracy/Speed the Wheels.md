Through the use of this Charm, the Solar can cause a bureaucracy to finish a task in record time. Using this Charm causes the organization to work faster by a number of degrees equal to a Solar’s Essence. A task that would be accomplished in a century takes only a season; a task that would be accomplished in a season takes only a month; what would take a month takes only a week; what takes a week only takes day, and what could be accomplished in days just takes minutes. Any request that would take less than a day is processed immediately; the Solar is literally moved to the front of the queue and is transferred into the services of an organization the moment she makes her request. Therefore, at Essence 3, a Solar could obtain records from a Fair Folk freehold that would normally take a century in just a week. At Essence 5, she could obtain it in minutes.
