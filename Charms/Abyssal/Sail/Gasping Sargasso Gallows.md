*Death’s Lawgiver condemns her foes to the depths of mortal despair, filling them with a drowning dread.*
The Abyssal makes a special ({Appearance, Charisma, or Manipulation} + Sail) inspire roll to spread sorrow, despair, or fear among any number of targets within medium range. Affected characters also begin drowning (Exalted, p. 232), even if they don’t normally need to breathe, coughing up putrid brine and seaweed.
Drowning characters suffer a −3 penalty on all rolls and must pay two Initiative to take a movement action.
Characters with Exalted Healing fall unconscious rather than dying if they run out of breath. Mortals killed by this always return as ghosts who have Defining Ties of fear towards the Abyssal.
Affected characters purge the water from their lungs by making a difficulty 7 (Stamina + Resistance) roll as a miscellaneous action. The difficulty falls by one each round, minimum (higher of Essence or 3). This action can’t be flurried with an attack and can’t be used while crashed. Alternatively, they can pay (Abyssal’s highest Social Attribute) Willpower to resist, causing the water to fade with their emotions. This cost falls by one each round, minimum (Essence).
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset when a nontrivial enemy affected by this Charm is incapacitated.
