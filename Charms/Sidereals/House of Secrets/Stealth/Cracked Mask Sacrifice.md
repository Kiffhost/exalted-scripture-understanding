*The Sidereal is struck by a fatal blow, but it is not her who dies — only someone who never was.*
When the Sidereal accepts a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201) to reduce a decisive attack’s damage, she may sacrifice a resplendent destiny instead of suffering maiming. If she has one active, she must sacrifice it; otherwise, she can expend any of her resplendent destinies.
This negates (Essence, maximum 5) levels of damage.
Characters can attempt a special instill roll to convince the Sidereal she can share her secrets, rolling twice and taking the lower result. The cost of effects used to enhance it must be paid separately for each roll. Success negates this Charm’s protection as above.
