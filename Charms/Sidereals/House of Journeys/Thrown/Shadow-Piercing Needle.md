*The Sidereal’s weapon unspools into a shimmering yellow strand of needle-sharp Essence, piercing both armor and soul.*
When the Sidereal attacks, her target’s soak is reduced to (his base Resolve + current temporary Willpower) and his Hardness is reduced to (base Resolve) against it, if those are lower. He can raise these values with applicable magic, but not artifact armor.
