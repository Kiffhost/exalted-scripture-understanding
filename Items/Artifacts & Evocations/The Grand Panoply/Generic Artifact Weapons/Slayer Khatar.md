*Made from an alloy of one or more magical materials, the blade of this punch dagger is between two and three feet long.*
This swift and brutal weapon is designed to punch through armor and deliver terrible stab wounds to the target. Some slayer khatars are incorporated into bracers, leaving the wielder’s hand free.
