*Striking with surgical precision, the Abyssal deathknight severs the flow of [[Essence]] through her victim’s meridians.*
The Abyssal makes one of the following gambits with ([[Dexterity]] + [[Medicine]]). This is usually an unarmed attack, but it can also use needles and other weapons with the Subtle tag. Any extra successes on a gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll cause the deathknight’s victim to lose that much [[Initiative]].
Creeping Rigor Affliction (Difficulty 5): The Abyssal rendering a limb numb, inflicting a −3 crippling penalty on rolls using that limb. Paralyzed arms can’t wield weapons or hold anything elsIf the Abyssal numbs both legs with multiple uses of this Charm, her victim falls prone.
Meridian-Charring Agony (Difficulty 3): The Abyssal sets her victim’s meridians ablaze with agitated [[Essence]], increasing his wound penalty by −1. If his total wound penalty equals or exceeds an action’s difficulty, he can’t place that action in a flurry. If the action was already incompatible with flurries, his wound penalty subtracts successes instead.
Sense-Stripping Gesture (Difficulty 4): The Abyssal suppresses one of her victim’s senses, inflicting a −3 penalty on rolls that use that sense.
Snuffed Candle Curse (Difficulty 2): The Abyssal suppresses her victim’s natural vitality. He doesn’t heal naturally, and loses the benefits of [[Exalted Healing]] (Exalted, pp. 165-166) if he has it. He suffers a −4 penalty toon rolls to resist illness or poison.
The crippling effects inflicted by these gambits last until a character receives at least an hour of medical treatment, requiring an ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) whose difficulty is the same as the relevant gambit’s.
With a [[Medicine]] 5, [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, this Charm’s effects can be used to make a damaging decisive attack with an appropriate weapon. The Abyssal may inflict one of the above effects by forgoing one level of damage, though the attack must deal at least 2+.
