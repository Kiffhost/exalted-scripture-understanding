The Lunar’s body becomes fluid and permeable as she’s struck, her foe’s weapon entering her flesh only to be trapped by twisting cords of sinew, swift-congealing blood, or a cage of solid bone. She clashes an attack with a (Stamina + Resistance) roll, adding (Hardness/2, rounded up) dice. In addition to the usual benefits of winning a clash, if she was attacked with a hand-to-hand weapon, her body absorbs it, disarming her attacker. Characters may dislodge the absorbed weapon with a disarm gambit or a difficulty 5 feat of strength that requires Strength 5+. If the attacker used a weapon with the Natural or Worn tag, his limb is instead mired in the Lunar’s flesh. Treat this as a grapple that requires no attack or Initiative roll; the Lunar rolls (Stamina + [Brawl, Martial Arts, or Resistance]) with double 9s as her control roll opposing the attacker’s (Strength + [Brawl or Martial Arts]). This Charm is incompatible with armor, except Invulnerable Moonsilver Carapace.
