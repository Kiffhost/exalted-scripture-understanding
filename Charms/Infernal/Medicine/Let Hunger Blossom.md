*A healthy appetite is the first step to recovery. Mindlessly gorging on flesh is the second.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation} + Medicine) inspire roll with double 8s to awaken hunger in any number of characters within medium range, ignoring multiple target penalties. Affected characters must act on their hunger by seeking out and eating whatever food is nearest, though this doesn’t include plant-based food. They’ll attack other characters or even feed on themselves if there’s no other food available, though they won’t harm other individuals that they have a positive Tie toward. Any character that successfully kills and eats another heals one level of non-aggravated damage.

Resisting this influence requires entering a Decision Point and citing at least a Minor Intimacy to spend one Willpower. This requires a Major or Defining Intimacy for mortals and First Circle demons.
