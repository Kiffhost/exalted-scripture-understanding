## Tribute to the Beast
Once per day, the sorcerer may make an offering to her witch-beast — from a prime piece of meat to a lavish ritual sacrifice. She rolls (Charisma + Survival) at difficulty (5 – Resources value of the offering). Success grants (Essence + extra successes) sorcerous motes, which last until the story ends or she uses this ritual again.
