*Pleas and supplication cannot turn the Infernal from her course, becoming a cloud of embers in her anima as they’re burned to nothingness by her refusal.*

The Infernal can spend motes instead of Willpower to resist social influence or other mind-affecting magic, paying five motes per Willpower. They always count toward increasing the Infernal’s anima banner, even if she spends personal motes.

If using this Charm raises the Infernal’s anima to bonfire, she gains +1 Resolve against the next influence roll made against her. She loses this benefit once her anima falls below bonfire.
