Flaws are particular debilities and drawbacks. Players may select one or more flaws for their character, if they desire, but don’t have to. [[Flaws]] are completely optional and carry no cost in points of any kind.

[[Flaws]] can add interesting quirks or qualities to a character that make them more fun to play or which help characterize them. For example, a player might select the [[Blind]] Flaw if she wants to play a legendary blind swordsman whose preternaturally keen hearing compensates for his lack of sight. 

If a Flaw comes up during play and significantly inconveniences or harms the character, this presents an opportunity to gain [[Character Advancement#Exalted Experience]] (p. 177). This only happens if the Flaw significantly harms or impedes the character— if the blind swordsman compensates for his blindness with [[Awareness]] [[Charms]] and triumphs over his enemies, then the Flaw has simply been a cool character detail in that scene—not a significant impediment or source of harm. If the same character had to follow a crimson-glass path through the Wyld to the freehold of a faerie noble, his blindness would become a significant problem once the road began to branch off into differently-colored paths leading to various dire fates, since, no matter how sharp his other senses, he has no way to “hear” or “feel” the color of the road. 

A few example [[Flaws]] are listed below. Storytellers and players should feel free to design their own additional [[Flaws]].

# TLDR

[[Flaws]] cost nothing and are inconvenient. When they come up they present an opportunity to gain Solar experience.
