*In the prison-body of Malfeas, strange powers seep through the soil and secrets drip as nectar from burning metal blossoms. Both the foolish and the desperate seek transformation through these these hellish fruits, a rite that leaves them forever changed — though rarely fatally. Most who walk this path sample many of Hell’s delicacies, though none are without peril. Some dare the hungry morass of Metagaos to harvest its edible thought-growths. Others plunder the long-neglected gardens of Armagand, Foe of All Mercy, to sup on her demon-songbirds feed, its many paths are guarded by jewelled orchids that blind and bewitch the unwary. Air-plants drooping with bursting pods are used as weapons in the bella caelestis, but some drift away from their course, providing a potent nectar if netted and carefully drained.*
