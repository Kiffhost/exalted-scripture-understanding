This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. The Lawgiver can listen in on a whispered conversation a mile away in still air, or in noisy conditions, such as a raging battlefield, out to long range. She can hear a thunderstorm burgeoning, an army decamping, a tyrant lizard roaring, and other loud noises at ([[Essence]] * 5) miles. She can read by passing her fingers over a page and feeling the ink beneath her fingertips. This Charm also confers the following techniques to the Solar: Conjure Image: For one mote, the Exalt can visualize an object she is touching, in sections no larger than a horse’s head. She can identify a familiar face in a pitch black crypt, but might need several activations to visualize the fossil skeleton of an ancient behemoth in a lightless cavern. Sense Current: For one mote, the Exalt can feel the lightest motion of air, orienting herself to the exit in even the most lightless of conditions. Read the Web: For five motes committed, the Exalt can listen in on a conversation behind a thick door, just by touching a connecting wall or surface. She feels the vibrations in her fingertips, and her senses translate them to words she can hear. This is a scene length effect, and its range can be extended up to ([[Essence]] x100) yards by running a wire from the Exalt’s fingertips into a chamber where her targets are speaking. Sound from Stillness Meditation: For six motes, one [[Willpower]], the Solar can take a Simple action lasting five minutes to filter Creation, listening for specific sounds or conversations that have already happened. The Exalt draws audio from the vibrations of sounds stored in her surroundings—usually rocks and trees—and may listen for noises or conversations that happened up to ([[Essence]] x5) hours prior to her arrival with a difficulty 5 [[Awareness]] roll. For the duration of the technique, the Solar must remain still, listening intently as she filters out the garbled static and unwanted sounds to reach the reverberations she’s searching for. As this technique only lasts five minutes, the Solar can only glean up to half that amount in useful audio. Unsurpassed Hearing and Touch follows the special activation rules of [[Unsurpassed Sight Discipline]] (p. 271), discounting the cost of hearing and touch effects instead of those which enhance sight. This Charm can never discount the cost of its own techniques.
