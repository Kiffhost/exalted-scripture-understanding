*When Death’s Lawgiver speaks, even the emptiest of the dead must obey.*
The Abyssal’s social influence is capable of affecting mindless undead. Essence 1 mindless undead count as having a Major Tie of loyalty to her if they don’t already serve another.
For one mote, the Abyssal can reanimate a touched corpse as a zombie (Exalted, p. 502). It has a Defining Tie of obedience towards her that can’t be weakened.
