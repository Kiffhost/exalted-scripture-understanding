*The Abyssal’s flesh is sustained by the [[Essence]] of death, lending her an uncanny vigor.*
She gains additional health levels based on her [[Stamina]] rating:
[[Stamina]] 1-2: One −1 level and one −2 level.
[[Stamina]] 3-4: One −1 level and two −2 levels.
[[Stamina]] 5: One −0 level, one −1 level, and one −2 level.
This Charm may be purchased ([[Resistance]]) times. If the Abyssal’s [[Stamina]] increases, her health levels change to reflect her new rating.
