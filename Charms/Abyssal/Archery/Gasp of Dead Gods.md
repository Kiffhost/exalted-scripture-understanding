*As the deathknight draws back her bowstring, she calls up a swirling maelstrom of wailing phantasms that collapses into a light-eating bolt of entropic Essence.*
The Abyssal makes a decisive attack against an enemy with lower Initiative. She ignores the limitations of her weapon’s range and can attack out to long range without needing to aim or at extreme range with an aim action. The attack has a base damage of (current temporary Willpower), which doesn’t include the deathknight’s Initiative or reset it. This is doubled as long as the Abyssal meets one of the following conditions, tripled for two conditions, or quadrupled for three or more
- The attack benefits from aiming.
- The target is crashed.
- The target has a wound penalty of −2 or higher.
- The Abyssal is within close range of her target.
- The target has a Tie of fear that applies to the deathknight.
With a repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a threemote, three-anima surcharge to add her Initiative to this Charm’s damage. (It isn’t multiplied). She resets Initiative on a hit. If she kills her victim, she gains (his Essence + 3) motes as she drinks in the last of his life’s Essence.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy whose Initiative was at least ten points higher than the Abyssal’s.
