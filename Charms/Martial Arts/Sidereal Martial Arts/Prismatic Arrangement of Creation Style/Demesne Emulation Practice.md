The martial artist’s stance bends the flows of Essence around her, becoming a nexus through which the world’s breath flows. Upon purchasing this Charm, the stylist chooses (Lore or Occult) hearthstones (including Linked stones). She can reflexively manifest one of these hearthstones as a jewel upon her brow, committing two motes for a lesser hearthstone or four motes for a greater hearthstone. Hearthstones that enhance weapons benefit her unarmed attacks. She gains the increased mote recovery for being in an attuned greater demesne (Exalted, p. 160). The hearthstones are indestructible but don’t survive the stylist’s death. The Storyteller should veto hearthstone choices that are overpowered if made permanent, like the Gem of Incomparable Wellness. While in a Martial Arts Form, if the stylist makes an attack that benefits from the manifested hearthstone, she adds one die of post-soak withering or decisive damage, or two dice for a greater hearthstone.
