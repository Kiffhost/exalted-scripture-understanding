The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s natural affinity for animals makes her a peerless trainer, able to rear and nurture even the most savage beasts. She may complete one interval of the extended roll to train an animal (Exalted, p. 554) in a week of training, rather than a month, and ignores the usual specialty requirements. A [[Survival]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase of this Charm lets the Dragon-Blood train her familiar to awaken magical abilities (Exalted, p. 555) at a cost of two experience points each. This cost is refunded if her familiar dies.
