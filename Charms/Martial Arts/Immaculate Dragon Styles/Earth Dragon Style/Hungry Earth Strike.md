*The jaws of Pasiap yawn wide in jagged fissures to consume those the Immaculate condemns.*
She makes a withering attack that must either be a smash attack or directed against a prone enemy, doubling 8s on the damage roll. If she crashes an enemy who’s standing on soil, stone, or a similar earthen substance (or is knocked onto such terrain by a smash attack), the ground beneath his feet swallows him to the waist. While swallowed in earth, that enemy cannot take movement actions and suffers the penalties for being prone (Exalted, p. 202). On each of his turns, he suffers one die of bashing damage from grinding stone, ignoring [[Hardness]]. Spirits suffer the effects of [[Ghost-Grounding Blow]] while trapped. If an enemy is incapacitated while buried, he dies, his body entombed in the depths of the earth. 
A buried enemy may attempt to break free from the earth as an extended ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) action, with difficulty (Immaculate’s [[Strength]]) and a goal number of (Immaculate’s [[Essence]] + [[Strength]]). That character’s allies may also attempt to pry him free with their own ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) rolls, adding their threshold successes towards his total. This roll is a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried.
In Earth Aura, the Immaculate may bury an enemy without crashing him if her attack reduces his [[Initiative]] from being higher than hers to lower. This Charm may only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial foe with a decisive attack from 20+ [[Initiative]].
