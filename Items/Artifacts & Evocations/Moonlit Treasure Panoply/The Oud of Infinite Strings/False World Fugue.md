The Lunar lulls her audience into a phantasmagorical reverie, beguiling them with her irresistible song.
The Lunar can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Butterfly Eyes Mirage]] (Lunars, p. 233) to affect multiple characters. She ignores multiple target penalties and gains the Charm’s Protean effect regardless of shape. The Lunar must choose the same thing to conceal from each target.
The Lunar must continue performing to maintain the illusion, using the same rules as [[Suspicion-Silencing Tune]].
While using this Evocation, [[Sentry-Distracting Song]] costs only one mote per round or minute.

## Special activation rules
The Lunar can reflexively activate [[Suspicion-Silencing Tune]] when she uses this Evocation, combining the effects of both performances.
