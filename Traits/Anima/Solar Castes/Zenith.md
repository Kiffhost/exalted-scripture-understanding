The noonday sun hangs high over Creation, its glory visible to all who walk in the light. In its sight, there can be no shadow—only endless radiance. So it is with the Solars of the Zenith Caste, heroes chosen to exemplify the Sun’s divine authority. These priest-kings are masters of oratory, but their actions speak even louder than their words— lesser priests might be satisfied with delivering sermons, but the Resplendent Suns let their faith shine through in their deeds as well. Virtue is the Zeniths’ duty, and they do not shirk it.

Long ago, the Zenith Caste presided over the people of the Realm, handing down edicts inspired by their patron’s boundless virtue. They led their subjects in prayer and celebration, stoking their faith and inspiring them to strive for new heights of righteousness. Before great decisions, the Zeniths sought guidance from their divine patron, praying to the Unconquered Sun for wisdom and insight. The night the Usurpation came, the Zeniths were the last to fall—their faith sustained them until the bitter end. Worn down by the ceaseless attacks of the Dragon-Blooded, they were as mountains eroded by the sea.

The Unyielding have returned to a world in dire need of their example. The Zeniths walk among all peoples, equally at home in princes’ courts and beggars’ shantytowns. They bring hope to the hopeless, faith to the faithless, and justice to the unrighteous. They endure whatever Creation throws at them, trusting in the might bestowed upon them by the Unconquered Sun to carry them through these dark times.

The Unconquered Sun speaks to each Zenith at the moment of Exaltation, urging them to make the world a righteous place as best they know how. Some Zeniths lived inspirational lives before Exaltation, acting as living examples for their fellow men. Others dwelt in iniquity before they came to the light—knowing the despair and pain that lies down that road, they do their best to keep others from choosing it. The Golden Bulls often act as a Circle’s backbone, supporting their fellows and calling them back when they stray too far from the Sun’s path. Some are their Circles’ official leaders, and they trust in their patron to help them guide their fellows wisely.

# Anima Banner

A Zenith Caste Mark is a brilliant golden circle, shining like the noonday sun on the brow. Zenith anima banners are bonfires of bright white and majestic gold.

# Anima Effects

The just and cleansing nature of the Unconquered Sun burns powerfully in the Essence of his priests, abhorrent to those things that lurk in darkness or rise from the dead. He also empowers the Pillars of Heaven to see righteousness done in the world, as best they know how. See page 176 for details. 

- For one mote, the Zenith’s anima leaps from her hand to a corpse she’s touching, igniting it in Solar flame. This power incinerates the corpse and ensures the soul of the deceased will not return as a hungry ghost. In addition, the Zenith may perceive the strongest Intimacies of the deceased and may choose to accept them. When she is ready, she may pay one mote, touching a target of those Intimacies to pass on feelings of peace, love, and assurance, shedding them in the process. She may also transfer them to an object, allowing it to convey comfort or a sense of duty to the subject. Conversely, she may touch someone who caused the deceased to suffer, paying one mote and rolling ([A social Attribute] + Presence) with three automatic non-Charm successes against their Resolve to transfer pain suffered by the deceased back on the one who caused it. The Storyteller is free to dictate the length and weight of such attrition.
- For 10 motes, one Willpower, the Zenith channels her Essence into an aura of divine retribution, surging around an attack. This power supplements a successful decisive attack against a creature of darkness, preventing the Solar’s Initiative from returning to its base value after the attack. When the Zenith’s anima is at bonfire, reduce the cost of this power by five motes and ignore the Willpower. This power may only be used once per day, resetting when the sun is at its zenith. 
- For seven motes, the Zenith may order a dematerialized spirit to manifest using a (Charisma + Presence) persuade action with (Essence) automatic successes. All spirits inherently recognize the Unconquered Sun’s authority in the priest-kings and are compelled as if by a Defining Intimacy, but may still have Defining Ties or Principles which counter this advantage. If successful, the Zenith’s very command draws the spirit into the material world, so that it does not need to pay the cost to materialize.
