By bracing herself against the ship and channeling Essence through it at the moment of impact, the Solar can cause her anima to absorb the damage, leaving the ship unharmed. The Exalt triggers this effect at the moment of impact, negating all damage to the shipâ€™s hull and masts. The Solar may only protect an area of the ship within (Essence * 20) feet of her current position. Some hazards, such as coral reefs or hidden rocks may cause continuous damage to the ship, forcing the Lawgiver to trigger this effect repeatedly. If so, ignore the Willpower cost for repeated consecutive uses.
