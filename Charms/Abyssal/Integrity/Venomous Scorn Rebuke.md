*Death’s Lawgiver has little patience for fools and sinners, swift to upbraid their unrighteous ways.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she witnesses someone act in a way that violates one of her Defining Intimacies or death’s chivalry. She forms a Minor Tie of contempt for him. As long as she openly expresses her scorn, she increases that Tie’s Resolve bonus by one and adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on influence rolls that solely target the offender or seek to turn others against him.
The Abyssal retains the Tie after this Charm ends.
With Integrity 5, the Abyssal can use this Charm when one of her Major Intimacies is violated.
### Whispers
The Abyssal can invoke Whispers to use this Charm without provocation, tapping the limitless hatred of the Neverborn.
