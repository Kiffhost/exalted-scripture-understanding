The Dragon-Blood’s eye pierces ciphers and circumlocutions like lightning. She rolls ([Perception or Intelligence] + [[Linguistics]]) with double 9s to break a code or deceptive message, including those that aren’t ciphered but have hidden subtext. Success lets her decipher the text as she reads it, completing hours or days of work in minutes. [[Enigma-Reading Eye]] is capable of contesting magical codes or ciphers, such as [[Letter-Within-A-Letter Technique]] (Exalted, p. 323).
