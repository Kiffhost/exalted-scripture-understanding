*The deathknight anoints an apostle of death, conferring her dread authority upon him.*
The Abyssal confers her blessing on a willing character. Characters with Major or Defining Ties of loyalty, respect, or fear toward the Abyssal apply those Intimacies to the subordinate at Minor Intensity, and instinctively recognize he serves the deathknight’s will.
This Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes when used on characters with Whispers, apostles blessed with Soul-Consuming Pyreflame Baptism, or the Abyssal’s Lunar mate.
With Presence 5, Essence 2, the Abyssal may pay a four-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s effect to characters who only have Minor Ties of loyalty, respect, or fear.
