The Dragon-Blood may admonish even a wildfire, brandishing elemental Essence to impose her will on the flame. This Charm can be used to divert a prairie wildfire, forest fire, or similar free-burning flame from the path of the Dragon-Blood and her travel companions. She must come within at least short range of the wildfire’s edge and roll (Charisma + Survival). The difficulty of the roll depends on the fire’s size — a small grass fire or a just-kindled forest fire might be difficulty 1, a larger forest fire difficulty 3, and an out-of-control blaze that spans miles difficulty 5+. The Storyteller may apply penalties or bonuses based on environmental factors such as recent rainfall or high winds that help the fire spread. A successful roll diverts the wildfire from the Dragon-Blood’s path. Though it continues to burn, it avoids the Exalt and her companions, and won’t pose any direct obstruction to them for the remainder of the story. If she has any threshold successes on the roll, she may redirect the wildfire to track down a character, using her total threshold successes in place of the (Perception + Survival) roll for tracking. Though it lacks sapience, the tamed wildfire is able to sense its quarry magically, and is thus even capable of tracking down a Solar using Traceless Passage. The Storyteller decides the fire’s speed based on environs and weather, up to a maximum of 150 miles per hour in ideal conditions. However, if there’s no path of forested land, grass, peat, or other fuel that the fire can follow to pursue its target, its efforts end, making it possible to escape by fleeing from the wilderness.
