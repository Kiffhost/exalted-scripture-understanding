*Thousand-Named Orphan was a masterful musician and lover, and it was said that he could steal anyone’s heart. Clad in alien armor with its own demonic soul, he discovered a more literal expression of that gift.*
This Evocation may only be used in an environment conducive to Sozen’s ominous phenomena. Dissolving into chiaroscuro and music, the wearer’s hand flickers through an opponent’s chest to steal his heart — the actual organ — as a difficulty 7 gambit. 
If the target has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to someone or something that he believes the wearer has stolen from him, or vice versa, reduce the difficulty by the rating of the highest relevant [[Intimacy|Tie]]. A stolen heart still functions; it continues to beat, and somehow its owner’s blood still flows through his veins. But he feels the constant ache of its absence, suffering a −4 wound penalty instead of the normal penalty he would take based on his current damage. 
If the Exalt wishes, she may crush the heart in her orichalcum grip. Treat this as an unarmed attack against a trivial opponent (Exalted, p. 208), applying all damage directly to the heart’s owner. 
When the wearer ends this Evocation or dies, the heart returns to its proper place in its owner’s chest if he is still alive. Creatures with no hearts are unaffected, while creatures with many hearts — or with little use for a heart, such as zombies — may experience fewer or no consequences. Additional restrictions or penalties may apply in unusual circumstances, at the Storyteller’s discretion. For instance, immaterial creatures’ hearts can only be stolen if the wearer can attack immaterial foes, while the heart of the mountain-sized behemoth Mostath may simply be too large and heavy to take without the use of magic such as [[Nine Aeons Thew]] (Exalted, p. 266). 
This Evocation can be used once per story. It can be reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) involving a theft, kidnapping, or liberation by subterfuge in support of a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]]. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
