*The Lawgiver shuns lesser forms of harm, fighting through injuries as though they never happened.*
This Charm slowly compensates for greater wounds by healing -0 health levels. The Exalt must pay the full cost of the Charm upon activation, paying one mote for every damaged -0 health level she wishes to heal. This Charm heals one -0 health level every (7 - [[Stamina]]) rounds. This Charm works even if the Solar has taken damage to her -1 or greater health levels.
