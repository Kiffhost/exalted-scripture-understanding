This style has no Charm for soulsteel, but the potential exists. Sidereals lack the affinity for death’s Essence necessary to create such a Charm themselves, but a Sidereal who’s learned all this style’s Charms could do so with an Abyssal’s aid, as could an Abyssal who’s mastered this style. 
Similarly, a Sidereal would need the aid of a character who’s resonant with adamant, like an Adamant Caste Alchemical, to create a Charm for Adamant.
In Four Magical Materials Form, such Charms would receive its discount, and the stylist could use Evocations of weapons made from their materials. With Enlightenment, she’d gain resonance with them.
