*Hardening her fists until they are unbreakable, the Exalt strikes a shattering blow.*
When this Charm supplements a withering attack made with the Solar’s bare hands, her strike gains an Overwhelming bonus equal to her [[Strength]]. For example, the Overwhelming value of a punch attack is 1. If the Solar’s [[Strength]] is 5, then her Overwhelming for this attack is 6. On a decisive attack, her damage is lethal, has double 10s, and rerolls 10s. On the tick she uses this Charm, the Lawgiver can [[Defense|parry]] lethal attacks with her bare hands without a stunt. A repurchase allows the Solar to use a Simple version of this Charm with a duration of one scene and a cost of five motes, one [[Willpower]]. This version may be activated reflexively for two motes, one [[Willpower]] if the Solar uses the supplemental version to successfully damage an opponent.
