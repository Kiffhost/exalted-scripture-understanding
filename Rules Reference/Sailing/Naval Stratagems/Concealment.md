The ship conceals itself from its enemy, perhaps diving into a heavy fogbank, or placing other ships, rocks, or sunken vessels between itself and its foe. This stratagem isnâ€™t possible on the open ocean with no concealment to utilize. If used successfully, concealment acts as both a positioning stratagem and adds +3 dice to the next Naval Maneuver roll.
