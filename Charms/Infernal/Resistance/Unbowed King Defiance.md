*A Green Sun Prince does not fall.*

When the Infernal would fall prone, she remains on her feet, bracing against her own spiritual pressure. Against an attack, she can wait until after the damage roll to use this Charm. She steals one Initiative from her attacker as he expends futile effort trying to bow her. If this crashes him, her anima flashes emerald. He’s blinded until he recovers from crash, suffering a −3 penalty on vision-based rolls.
