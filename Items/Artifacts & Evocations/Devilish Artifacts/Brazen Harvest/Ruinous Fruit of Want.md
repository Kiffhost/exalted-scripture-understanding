*Brazen Harvest’s riotous Essence forces its way into a victim, turning his flesh and will into a seedbed for Hrotsvita’s ceaseless, hungry growth.*

The wielder makes a withering attack against an enemy suffering at least a −1 penalty from Entombed in Luxury or Shining Ivy Shackle, adding dice of post-soak damage equal to the target’s penalties from both those Evocations. Crashing them inflicts the following effects:
- The maximum penalty he can suffer from Entombed in Luxury and Shining Ivy Shackle increases to (wielder’s Essence + 1). Clearing the overgrowth from either requires a basic repair project, even for artifacts.
- At the start of each of his turns, any weapons he wields grows as if affected by a use of Shining Ivy Shackle, while armor and clothing suffers Entombed in Luxury.
- Any other objects he touches swiftly become squirming masses of hellish growth. Tools or other handheld equipment become unusable at the end of his next turn, requiring a basic repair project to restore. Larger objects and portions of structures that he touches remain horribly enlivened as long as he’s within short range. This includes bedding, furniture, and other constructed comforts, preventing him from receiving the benefits of rest for healing and mote recovery.
- He counts as having a Minor Intimacy that supports greed and a desire for violence, or treats existing Intimacies based on them as one step higher. He increases such Intimacies’ Resolve penalties by one and must spend an additional point of Willpower to resist influence they support.
- Once per day, when he has the opportunity to indulge his greed or desire for violence, he must spend one Willpower to refrain from doing so. If he indulges, he regains one Willpower. This isn’t triggered by opportunities that would threaten his Intimacies.

Affected characters are dimly aware that they may free themselves from Hrotsvitha’s touch by fasting and abstaining from violence and indulgence for three days. Magic that prevents Shaping effects can protect objects from transformation, but freeing the affected character from its transformative touch requires magic that can break curses.

Outside of combat, this Evocation can also be used on a helpless character without requiring a roll.
### Dissonant
The curse lasts for (wielder’s Essence) days.
## Reset
This Evocation can’t be used on the same character more than once per story. No reset is needed for attacks that don’t crash their target.
