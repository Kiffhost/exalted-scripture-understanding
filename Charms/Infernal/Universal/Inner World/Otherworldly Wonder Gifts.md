*The Infernal brings forth strange treasures and unworldly allies from her inner world.*

When the Infernal uses [[Sanctum-Soul Threshold Meditation]] to leave her inner world, she can bring its objects or inhabitants with her. They must have already been introduced in play, potentially by introducing a fact. Bringing an object light enough to carry costs two motes, or five motes for an object up to the size of a person. The inner world’s denizens cost one mote for those equivalent in strength to a one-dot [[Familiar]] (Exalted, p. 161), or five motes if they’re equivalent to a mortal human or a two-dot [[Familiar]]. Larger objects and stronger denizens can’t leave the inner world.

The Infernal can’t bring artifacts, supernatural creatures, or the like with her, except for artifacts she’s created herself and other things made through her own prowess, rather than reshaping her inner world.
