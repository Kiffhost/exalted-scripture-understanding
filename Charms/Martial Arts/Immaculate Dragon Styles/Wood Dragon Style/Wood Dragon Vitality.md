*At one with the font of all life in Creation, the Immaculate suffuses her body with unyielding vitality.*
She adds ([[Martial Arts]]) natural soak against a withering attack, or subtracts one die from the damage of a decisive attack.
In Wood Aura, the Immaculate adds ([[Essence]] + [[Martial Arts]]) soak, or subtracts (Essence/2, rounded up) dice of decisive damage.
