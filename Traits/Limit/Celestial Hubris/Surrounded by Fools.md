The Sidereal believes her allies, peers, superiors, and subordinates to be short-sighted incompetents, incapable of being trusted with even the least of tasks. If something must be done, she’ll do it herself. If it’s impossible for her to avoid delegating some tasks, she micromanages those assigned the task in even the most irrelevant details. Any Ties of respect or other Ties based on appreciating someone’s skill, knowledge, or judgment are suppressed for the Hubris’ duration.
This ends if the Sidereal is saved from a significant peril by someone for whom she has a suppressed Major or Defining Tie.
