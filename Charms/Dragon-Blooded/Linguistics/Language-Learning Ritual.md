*The Dragon-Blood contemplates a foreign tongue until its meaning is, like air, transparent.*
She may use this Charm to gain understanding of a [[language]] that she’s spent at least (6 − [[Intelligence]]) days studying, allowing her to understand it in both spoken or written forms. This doesn’t confer the ability to communicate in that language. 
With [[Linguistics]] 4, [[Essence]] 2, the Dragon-Blooded may speak and write in the chosen language. She is lacking in accent and unsophisticated in vocabulary, imposing a −3 success penalty on any social influence rolls. With [[Linguistics]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Dragon-Blooded no longer suffers a penalty after a total of (6 − [[Intelligence]]) weeks spent studying or using it.
