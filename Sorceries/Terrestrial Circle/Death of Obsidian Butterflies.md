*Sculpting [[Essence]] into volant black glass, the sorcerer unleashes a cascade of obsidian butterflies.*
She rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) as an undodgeable decisive attack applied in a line against enemies out to medium range. This line is wide enough to strike all opponents within the width of a single range band and reaches high enough to strike aerial enemies who are at short range to the ground (medium range enemies in the air can still be targeted by directing the butterflies to fly along an upward path, rather than a horizontal one). Battle groups are especially vulnerable to being cut down by this spell, taking a -2 penalty to [[Defense]] against it. The attack deals raw damage equal to the sorcerer’s ([[Essence]] + extra successes), or ([[Essence]] + [[Occult]] + extra successes) against a battle group. It does not reset the sorcerer to base [[Initiative]]. Scenery made of wood, glass, or other fragile materials is generally destroyed. After this spell has been cast, the obsidian butterflies fall to the ground and shatter, creating terrain that may be hazardous for barefooted characters to traverse—treat as an environmental hazard inflicting two dice of lethal damage, difficulty 2 to resist with a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) roll, and if the character is barefoot, difficult terrain as well. Any character wearing armored boots can generally ignore the debris. 

A sorcerer who knows [[Death of Obsidian Butterflies]] as her control spell gains ([[Essence]]) bonus dice to the spell’s attack roll. When her emotions run hot, butterfly silhouettes rise from her shadow. When she is angry, her fingernails turn to sharp volcanic glass, making it possible to cut cloth or paper, rend wood or flesh and other similar stunts. 

### THE RIGHT DEMON FOR THE JOB

Demon summoning isn’t a trap or a surefire path to corruption. Most sorcerers view it as a source of supernatural slaves, and they’re usually right. A bound demon follows the letter and spirit of the sorcerer’s commands to the best of its understanding. The greatest difficulty most summoners face is coping with the alien natures and inhuman desires of their servants.
