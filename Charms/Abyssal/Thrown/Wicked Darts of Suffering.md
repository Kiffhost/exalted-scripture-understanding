*Countless blades fly from the deathknight’s hands, sending bloody shrapnel through all those unfortunate enough to stand against her.*
The deathknight makes a withering attack against one enemy — her primary target — and all other enemies within short range of him. She only rolls damage against her primary target. Other enemies take the same amount of damage, maximum (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]), which doesn’t award [[Initiative]] to the deathknight.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by dealing 3+ decisive damage to a crashed enemy.
