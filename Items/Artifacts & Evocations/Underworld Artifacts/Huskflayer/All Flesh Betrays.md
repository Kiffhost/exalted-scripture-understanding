*Huskflayer’s malevolence festers in its victim’s wounds, leaving traces of viscera and rotting flesh that worm through its victim’s flesh to seize control.*
## Dissonant
Characters dissonant with [[Huskflayer]] can’t awaken this Evocation.
Huskflayer’s wielder rolls ([[Initiative]] + gore points) against each character she’s harvested gore points from this scene. Nontrivial enemies may oppose this with a ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll. Battle groups add ([[Size]] + [[Might]] dice).
Huskflayer’s wielder can then spend gore points as described below to take control of affected enemies, revealing she’s left traces of harvested flesh in their wounds.
Mortals and Trivial Enemies: For one gore point, the wielder can take control of all affected mortals and trivial supernatural enemies for the rest of the scene. On each affected character’s turn, Huskflayer’s wielder can force him to take a physical action or speech-based social action of her choice, though she can’t force supernatural beings to use magic. If he wishes to take another action on his turn, he must flurry. He can flurry actions that would normally be incompatible, like two attacks, and compelled actions never count as his attack or movement action for the round.
Supernatural Foes: Taking control of nontrivial supernatural characters costs (their [[Essence]]) gore points, or (Essence/2, rounded up) if they’re crashed. This works like with mortals, but only on that character’s next turn — or, if he’s crashed, until he recovers from it, if that comes later.
Battle Groups: For each affected battle group, the wielder may pay (its Size/2, rounded up) gore points to force a difficulty 3 rout check, turning soldiers under her control against their allies. If the battle group fails the rout check and suffers dissolution (Exalted, p. 209), it reforms under the wielder’s command for the rest of the scene, losing one dot of [[Size]].
Corpses: For one gore point, the wielder can reanimate any living enemies she’s slain this scene as zombies (Exalted, p. 502) with a Defining Tie of obedience toward her, which assemble into a battle group under her command. These corpses persist indefinitely once created.
This control isn’t a Psyche effect, but a crippling effect, caused by the grafted tissue taking over the victim’s musculature. If the wielder tries to force a nontrivial character to violate one of his Major or Defining Intimacies or that would be unacceptable influence, he may resist it for one [[Willpower]] and one health level, tearing away the grafted flesh. This still uses one of his actions for the turn. Battle groups don’t need to pay damage, but lose another dot of [[Size]] as newly-freed soldiers cut down the wielder’s thralls.
## Resonant
The wielder can use this Evocation reflexively when [[Gruesome Triumph Revel]] raises her [[Initiative]] above that of all enemies. She doesn’t empty her gore pool until after paying All Flesh Betrays’ gore point cost.
## Reset 
Once per day. For resonant wielders, once per scene.
