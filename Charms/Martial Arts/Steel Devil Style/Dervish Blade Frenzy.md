If the Exalt lands a damaging Steel Devil Strike followed by a damaging Empty Mind Strike, she may use this Charm, wrenching her blades free to pause for a moment in a harmony of carnage and serenity, before unleashing a furious onslaught of strikes. Invoking this Charm automatically adds one point of Charge to the Exalt’s Offhand Charge and allows her to immediately attack the same target with Triple Attack Technique, regardless of whether she has learned it. If she has, she is able to attack with a Quadruple Attack Technique, which uses Triple Attack’s damage bonus and adds (Essence or three, whichever is lower) automatic successes to the post soak damage roll. 

## Mastery

Dervish Blade Frenzy can chain into Steel Devil Strike or Empty Mind Strike.
