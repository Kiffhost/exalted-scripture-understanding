*The Sidereal digs her fingers into someone’s shadow and rips it free, flinging it with stolen strength to set its journey in motion.*
The Sidereal makes an unarmed ([[Strength]] + [[Thrown]]) gambit against an enemy within close range. Its difficulty is the target’s (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Defense]]). If successful, she steals his shadow and makes a decisive attack with it against another character within medium range, using the same attack roll. This secondary target must be chosen before the gambit’s attack roll; if it doesn’t beat his [[Defense]], this Charm has no effect. The thrown shadow uses its master’s [[Initiative]] to determine damage and resets his [[Initiative]] instead of the Sidereal’s. She can enhance this with other [[Charms]], which must be used before the roll. The shadow eventually returns to its master, though it may dally for a while. Alternatively, if the Sidereal’s somehow lost her shadow, she can replace it with a stolen one. This counts as a sorcerous curse on the victim.
