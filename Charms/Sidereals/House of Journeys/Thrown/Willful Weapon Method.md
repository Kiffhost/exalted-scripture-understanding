*The Sidereal throws both her weapon and its shadow, speeding inexorably toward her enemy’s heart.*
The Sidereal makes a decisive attack. If she misses, she reflexively makes a second attack with her weapon’s shadow against the same target, with (Initiative/2, rounded down) base damage. Success on the second attack doesn’t reset the Sidereal’s [[Initiative]]; she instead loses [[Initiative]] equal to her successes on the damage roll. If she hits, she gains one [[Willpower]].
