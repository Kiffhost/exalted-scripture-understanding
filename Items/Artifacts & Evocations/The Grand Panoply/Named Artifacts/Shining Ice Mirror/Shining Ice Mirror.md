Shining Ice Mirror is beautiful and minimalist by the standards of most daiklaves, with a thin, slightly curved jade blade the color of ice catching the afternoon sun and a hilt woven with the thinnest of precious starmetal wires. It’s a blade of deliberate nature, rewarding foresight in battle while disdaining those who hack and rend their way through their foes. Ancient records indicate the daiklave was forged by the Terrestrial sorceress Mikako Khem as a gift for the Solar her family served as retainers. Shining Ice Mirror was shaped entirely in frozen flames at the heart of a manse now long destroyed, and served as a sign of Gens Mikako’s bond of devotion until the night of the Usurpation. Surviving documents from the Shogunate indicate that it was unearthed from its Solar owner’s grave and carried into battle against the Winter Folk in several major battles, reverently returned after each untombing with great propitiating rituals. The weapon was believed lost during the Wyld Crusade, until it was recently unearthed by Haslanti League explorers during the excavation of First Age ruin buried beneath a massive glacier. Now a terrible shadow stalks the daiklave as it makes its way across the North. Its last three owners have been found torn asunder, their blood frozen around them; and yet no records survive to indicate where the weapon was once entombed. Shining Ice Mirror possesses a single hearthstone socket at the bottom of its hilt. 

## Evocations of Shining Ice Mirror

A Solar who pays two extra motes to attune to Shining Ice Mirror may partake of its perfect balance and discerning spirit so that an aim action taken with the intent to strike with the blade also conveys the benefits (but not costs) of a full defense action.
