The assassin Bright Withering was among the most reviled conspirators of the so-called Shadow Deliberative, a political coalition opposed to the Deliberative that ruled the Old Realm in that era. While most in the Shadow Deliberative played subtle games of intrigue and politics, Bright Withering took the direct approach, assassinating Exalted whose governance they deemed a threat to the Old Realm. None today remember whether they were caught by the Deliberative or betrayed by their co-conspirators, but their punishment is still legend. Using powerful sorcery and the greatest of Lunar witchcraft, the eldest of Luna’s Chosen fettered Bright Withering in moonsilver and cast them out beyond existence, exiling them to a moon that might have been, but never was.
For centuries, Bright Withering knew only cold, darkness, and rage. At first, escape consumed their every waking moment. They explored the othermoon’s alien landscapes and eerie caverns until they knew every inch, but found no escape. They sought counsel and mystical wisdom from their past lives, but none could help them. Finally, Bright Withering realized why they had failed. They were not an explorer or a mystic; they were Bright Withering, the killer. What they needed was a weapon.
Bright Withering had slipped their moonsilver fetters in the second century of their exile, but there wasn’t enough metal for the weapon they envisioned. They carved their scythe-blade from the othermoon’s pale stone instead, making sparing use of moonsilver to line its cutting edge and fill in cracks and flaws in the stone.
At the end of their long toil, they took the grimscythe in hand, swung it through the air, and found themselves back in Creation.
In the days to come, the blood of their enemies would stain both Moonreaver’s edge and the othermoon’s bone-white sands. Bright Withering ultimately fell, slain by a victim’s Dawn Caste mate amid the chaos of the Old Realm’s fall, but not before they saw their vendetta completed against those who’d imprisoned them. They were entombed alongside their grimscythe, which is said to still remain undisturbed.
Moonreaver seems a crude weapon, created by an inexperienced artificer without workshop or tools. The stone of its scythe-blade is rough and uneven, while its moonsilver haft is knobbled and uneven in places, like a gnarled tree branch. At times, the moonsilver’s polished surface reflects the othermoon, rather than reality, exuding a cold that rimes the grimscythe with ice. 
 
## Evocations of Moonreaver

When swung by an attuned wielder, Moonreaver seems to cut through space, briefly revealing the othermoon’s vistas before the tears in reality close. Its Evocations unleash freezing winds through these rifts and banish things to the othermoon.
Upon attuning to Moonreaver, the wielder awakens Cold Breath of the Moon for free.
