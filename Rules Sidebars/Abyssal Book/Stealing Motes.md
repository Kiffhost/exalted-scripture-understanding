A number of Abyssal [[Charms]] let them steal motes. Motes can only be stolen from characters with mote pools of their own, and the deathknight canâ€™t steel more motes than an enemy has. She may choose whether to drain personal or peripheral motes with such effects, adding them to the same pool she steals from.
