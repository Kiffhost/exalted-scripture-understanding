Nightmare Shard’s mirrored edge lays bare the truth of soul-hauntinghorrorsandinsidiousnightmares.Itswielder rolls (Perception + Occult + Essence) to read a character’s intentions. Success reveals a Derangement possessed by that character if he has one, as well as its intensity. 

## Special activation rules

A character who isn’t dissonant with moonsilver can awaken this Evocation at no cost by successfully defeating a non-trivial enemy who suffers from a Derangement, or a non-trivial creature of the Wyld such as a raksha.
