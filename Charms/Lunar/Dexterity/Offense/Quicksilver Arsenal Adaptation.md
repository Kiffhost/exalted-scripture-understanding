*The Lunar’s fluid battle style draws no distinctions between weapons.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, for each dot that the Lunar has in [[Archery]], [[Brawl]], [[Martial Arts]], [[Melee]], or [[Thrown]], she gains a dot that may be placed in another of those Abilities with a lesser or equal rating, up to a maximum of ([[Essence]] + 5) dots.
When the Lunar purchases a dot in one of these Abilities with experience, she likewise receives an additional dot to assign as above. This can’t take her above the ([[Essence]] + 5) limit.
