None can put asunder the sacred oath of a Sworn Kinship. When a character that isn’t part of the Dragon-Blood’s Hearth makes an influence roll targeting her or any of her Sworn Kin, they may combine their will against it. If any Hearthmate who witnesses the influence has an [[Intimacy]] opposing it, it becomes available to all members of the Hearth, either to bolster their [[Resolve]] or to use in [[Decision Points]]. A Hearthmate who does so subsequently gains the borrowed [[Intimacy]] at Minor intensity.
If a Hearthmate already has two opposing Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] — either ones he possesses naturally, or ones borrowed from a Hearthmate — each additional Hearthmate who possesses an opposing Defining [[Intimacy]] instead grants him +1 [[Resolve]] each.
If the Dragon-Blood uses this Charm multiple times in the same scene, the [[Willpower]] cost of all activations past the first is waived.
