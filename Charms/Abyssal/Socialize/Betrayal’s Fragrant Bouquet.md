*The Abyssal knows well the stench of treachery and deceit.*
The deathknight makes a special read intentions roll.
Success lets her player ask the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes.
- Does he intend to deceive or betray me?
- Does he think I intend to deceive or betray him?
- Has he betrayed someone who trusts him in the past?
- Who here does he most distrust?
If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind, the Abyssal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
