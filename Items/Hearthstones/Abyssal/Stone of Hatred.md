This red and black stone feels icy cold unless its bearer thinks of an enemy, at which point it turns unbearably hot. Socketed in an attuned artifact weapon, it focuses the bearer’s enmity; the weapon’s attacks deal aggravated damage to any opponent for whom the bearer holds a Major or Defining [[intimacy]] of hatred.
