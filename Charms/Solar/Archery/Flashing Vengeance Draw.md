To invite the wrath of the Lawgiver is to invoke oneâ€™s own doom. The Solar gains ([[Essence]]) automatic successes to her [[Join Battle]] result, and if she acts before her target, her first attack is unblockable. [[Flashing Vengeance Draw]] is expressly permitted to be used in combination with [[Charms]] that boost [[Join Battle]] results, so long as they are not based in [[Melee]], [[Thrown]], or [[Brawl]].
