*Striking at an unseen movement, the Exalt draws a formless pattern from the depths of the universe.*
A blazing white-gold [[Essence]] diagram extends in a circle around the Lawgiver, spreading out to short range. Spirits with [[Essence]] ratings equal to or lower than the Exalt’s must materialize or leave the circle. Spirits with a higher [[Essence]] rating than the Exalt must apply their [[Resolve]] against the Solar’s ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) in order to resist, with the Solar’s influence gaining ([[Essence]]) dice against normal spirits or ([[Essence]]) automatic successes against demons and other cursed spirits. This mandala stays fixed on the location the Solar is standing for one scene, and vanishes if she leaves the circle. Spirits of equal or lower [[Essence]] than the Solar cannot attack characters inside the circle while standing outside it, and spirits forced to leave the diagram may not attack characters within it.
