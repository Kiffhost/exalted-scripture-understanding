Even as her life crumbles around her, the Sidereal refuses to succumb to despair — how can she, when the world itself calls for an encore? The Sidereal counts suffering a noteworthy defeat or setback related to her patron Maiden’s purview as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX). She loses one additional Limit when she does. Examples include: Journeys: Getting somewhere too late. Not being able to catch someone or something you’re pursuing. Suffering significant harm from dangers encountered while traveling. Serenity: Struggling with significant troubles in a relationship (romantic or otherwise). Missing an opportunity to win or leverage someone’s positive feelings, obligations, or support for you. An enterprise or organization the Sidereal’s involved coming on hard times. Battles: Retreating, surrendering, or suffering defeat in combat. Having an audience or public sentiment turned against you. Losing soldiers, significant amounts of materiel, artifact armaments, etc. Secrets: Having a secret you were keeping exposed. Missing an opportunity to learn something, or learning something that’s actually inaccurate or detrimental to her. Failure in endeavors involving spirits, sorcery, artifice, geomancy, etc. Endings: Missing an opportunity to kill someone or destroy something once you set out to do so. Someone or something the Sidereal is protecting or caring for coming to serious harm. The death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, a betrayal by a friend, etc. These examples aren’t exhaustive or mutually exclusive — just because something falls under one Maiden’s purview doesn’t mean it can’t also be under another Maiden’s as well. With a Performance 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay ten motes, one Willpower once per story when she fulfills an auspicious prospect this way to end a Psyche effect, Shaping effect, or sorcerous curse she suffers, finding clarity in failure. The Scripture of the Dancer Once, there was a maiden… ...who stood at the center of every dance. Back then, she knew all the dances. She never missed a step. One day, she heard something in the music, as a singer dropped the beat. It taught her the joy of dancing poorly. She started dancing more and more awry. “Love has no rules,” she said.
