*The Infernal thrills as arrows rain down upon her, skipping between them to meet her foe.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after dodging an attack made from medium or long range, instantly dashing into close range with her attacker. She adds (Essence/2, rounded up) automatic successes on any close range attacks or rushes she makes against that enemy until the end of her next turn, and can rush with (Dexterity + Dodge).

If the Infernal has [[Sand-Through-Fingers Defense#Laughing Gust Denial (Dodge 5, Essence 2)|Sand-Through-Fingers Defense (Laughing Gust Denial)]], its benefits apply to her movement with this Charm.
