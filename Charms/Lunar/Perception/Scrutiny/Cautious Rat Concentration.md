*The Lunar watches those who watch her.*
She makes a read intentions roll against all characters she’s aware of. She discerns whether each character whose [[Guile]] she beat harbors any suspicions toward her, and those suspicions’ general nature — she can distinguish whether the prince eyeing her believes she might be an impostor, or fears she’s seduced his husband. If the Lunar uncovers any suspicion, she gains +1 [[Guile]] for the scene. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
