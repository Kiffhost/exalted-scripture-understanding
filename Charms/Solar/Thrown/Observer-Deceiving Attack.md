*The art of misdirection comes naturally to a master of throwing weapons.*
Through the use of this Charm, the Solar can conceal a thrown attack, causing her opponents to believe it was made from a completely different angle or direction. Characters who want to spot the true course of the attack must succeed at a ([[Wits]] + [[Awareness]]) roll at difficulty of (Solarâ€™s [[Essence]] + {the number of 10s on the attack roll}). Any 1s rolled by her opponent subtracts from his successes. At [[Thrown]] 5, [[Essence]] 3+, successful misdirects allow the Exalt to attack without breaking stealth.
