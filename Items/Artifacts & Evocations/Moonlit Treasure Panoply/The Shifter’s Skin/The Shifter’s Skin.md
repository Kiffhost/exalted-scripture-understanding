*Kintai Shatterstep devoted herself to making an art of shapeshifting, flowing between forms with a dancer’s grace.*
This virtuoso talent made her a master of infiltration and subterfuge, clad in stolen faces and the skins of beasts. Those who stood against her found their kingdoms and armies collapsing from within, undone by sabotage and devilment.
[[The Shifter’s Skin]] was born of Kintai’s ordeal, infiltrating the citadel of the Seven Tyrants of Bruhn to sow the seeds of their downfall. But the tyrants were more prepared than she knew — she was found, and forced to flee into the labyrinth of the Ashknell Forest. She clambered through trees in a squirrel’s shape, tunneled beneath the earth as a badger, and took to the air on a larch’s wings, but it wasn’t enough. The keen-eyed tyrants pursued her no matter what shape she took, striking her again and again with arrows that spread rot through her flesh.
As midnight fell, Kintai finally escaped her pursuers, but she knew her cursed wounds were fatal. In a final act of defiance, the master shapeshifter cast off her skin like a serpent’s scales, stripping away the rot that consumed her as she drew her last breath. Her Circle retrieved her remains to entomb them, but kept her cast-off skin, reinforcing it with moonsilver and forging it into armor as mutable as Kintai herself. It’s been passed down through the [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] since then, a faithful companion to those who would match Kintai’s skill in shapeshifting. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the Shifter’s Skin

The Shifter’s Skin’s [[Evocations]] bolster its wielder’s shapeshifting prowess, enhancing many Lunar [[Charms]] that involve shapeshifting.
The Skin’s wearer reduces the cost of shifting into animal shapes by one mote. This includes [[Charms]] like [[Emerald Grasshopper Form]].
Non-Lunars: This artifact’s listed [[Evocations]] are unsuitable to non-Lunars. Such characters might instead awaken [[Evocations]] that grant them limited animalistic shapeshifting and upgrade their native [[Charms]] in ways that expand on that shapeshifting. Alternatively, characters who already have some form of transformation, like an Infernal’s Devil-Body, could awaken [[Evocations]] that upgrade it with bestial power.
