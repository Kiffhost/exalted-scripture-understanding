*The Infernal speaks with the voice of the Old Ones, proclaiming their blessings and commands to an unrighteous world.*

Upon learning this Charm, the Infernal gains one of its keys for free. Each allows her to express a certain kind of Intimacy through oratory.

When the Infernal uses this Charm, she chooses a key she knows and makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Performance) roll to instill one of that key’s Intimacies. The instilled Intimacy’s Resolve penalty is increased by one for the rest of the scene, or by two for mortals and First Circle demons.

The Infernal gains a special pool of motes equal to the 10s on her roll. They can only be spent on Charms that enhance influence rolls against affected characters that leverage the instilled Intimacy. This includes influence rolls with any Ability.

With Performance 5, Essence 2, the Infernal gains motes for her 9s as well.
## [[Keys]]
#### All is Lost
The Infernal explains why her audience is already doomed, defeated, or otherwise without a hope, expressing a Principle of belief in her explanation or similar Intimacies.
#### Gospel of Submission
The Infernal speaks of hierarchy and submission. She can express a Tie reflecting obedience, submission, loyalty, or the like towards affected characters’ superiors in an organizational, legal, social, or metaphysical hierarchy. Alternatively, she can express a negative Tie towards affected characters’ inferiors.
#### Hope in Hell
The Infernal speaks of a better future, expressing an Intimacy based on hope. This isn’t compatible with Charisma-based rolls.
#### Infernal Rhapsode Eloquence
This key can only be used through storytelling, acting, and poetry recitals, not conventional oratory. She expresses a Tie toward the work she performs or an Intimacy related to that form of performance more broadly, like a Principle emphasizing the importance of stories in people’s lives.
#### Litany of Love and Hate
The Infernal praises her beloved and condemns those she reviles, expressing one of her own Major or Defining Ties based on love or hatred.
#### My Will Be Done
The Infernal commands the attention and obedience of her audience, expressing Ties of loyalty, obedience, terrified awe, or other Intimacies that give affected characters reason to obey her. This isn’t compatible with Manipulation-based rolls.
#### Parable of the Peak
The Infernal speaks of lofty wisdom, expressing one of her own Major or Defining Principles based on philosophical, ethical, or spiritual beliefs. This isn’t compatible with Manipulation-based rolls.
#### Demon-Prophet Exhortations (Performance 4, Essence 2, any one key) (+1m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to make a persuade roll that leverages an Intimacy that fits one of her keys. Instead of persuading targets to perform a specific task, she names a broader goal related to her Intimacy. Affected characters work toward that goal however they see fit, with a level of effort based on the strength of the supporting Intimacy (Exalted, p. 216). She doesn’t gain motes from her 9s and 10s.
#### Call to Righteous Blasphemy (Performance 5, Essence 3, [[#Demon-Prophet Exhortations (Performance 4, Essence 2, any one key) (+1m, 1wp)|Demon-Prophet Exhortations]])
If the Infernal uses this Charm to instill an Intimacy and then uses [[#Demon-Prophet Exhortations (Performance 4, Essence 2, any one key) (+1m, 1wp)|Demon-Prophet Exhortations]] to leverage that Intimacy in the same scene, the Willpower cost to resist the persuade roll is increased by one and the instilled Intimacy’s intensity count as one step higher in the Decision Point. If it’s already Defining, the Willpower cost increases by two instead.
