Carved from white jade and starmetal, its innards a bewildering mesh of god’s hair and demon’s sinew, this ancient torc isn’t meant to be worn by its owner. Instead, it locks into place when fixed around another’s throat — a difficulty 6 gambit in combat — then tightens painfully, either on the owner’s command or whenever the wearer attacks or disobeys the owner. On each turn, the collar’s wearer must succeed on a difficulty 5 ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll or suffer a level of bashing damage. If he wishes to take another action, he must use a flurry. The collar relents only when the owner tells it to stop or the wearer falls unconscious. While attuned, it cannot be removed except by the owner as long as she lives, or with an appropriate spell or working of the Solar Circle.

Attuning to the collar costs three motes. Attunement lapses immediately if the collar is over ([[Essence]] x 10) miles away from the owner.
