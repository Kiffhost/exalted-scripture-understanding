The Lunar steels her will against even the harshest duress. When her [[Resolve]] is beaten by influence that opposes a positive Major or Defining Tie toward an individual, the cost to resist is reduced by one [[Willpower]], minimum zero. If she knows GrudgeNursing Resentment, she may use this Charm against influence that opposes negative Major or Defining Ties. This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset by upholding the Tie used to invoke it.
