The Lunar is a frenetic blur of violence, the momentum of her blows impelling her across the battlefield. To use this Charm, she must move into close range with an enemy and attack him on the same turn. If successful, she reflexively moves one range band in any direction. This doesnâ€™t count as her move action. 
## Protean 

In flight-capable shapes or aquatic animal shapes, the Lunar may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to instead ascend or descend two range bands through air or water, respectively.
