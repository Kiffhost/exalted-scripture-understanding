*The Infernal becomes all that her nemesis is and isn’t, a hateful mirror reflecting his weakness and vice.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must be using [[Nemesis Self Imagined Anew]] on a character with lesser or equal Essence. Her nemesis need not be present. His reflection leaves him with a faint sensation of phantom pain, emerging to cocoon the Infernal in quicksilver. She emerges as a perfect copy of her nemesis — more perfect, in fact, for she has his reflection.

The transformed Infernal loses all traits of her own and uses those of her target, essentially treating his character sheet as if it were her own in every way. She’s still a [[CREATURES OF DARKNESS|creature of darkness]], and the duplication doesn’t apply to equipment and Story Merits. The Infernal retains her memories and her personality, though replacing her own Intimacies with those of her nemesis may distort her identity to fit. Any Charms or other magic that she has active when she uses this Charm immediately end. Magic used by others is suppressed during this transformation, whether beneficial or harmful.

It’s impossible to see through this transformation by any means, though Charms like [[Eye of the Unconquered Sun]] that can undo shapeshifting can penetrate it. The Infernal automatically succeeds on rolls made with any Ability to impersonate her nemesis, and rolls against her Guile fail automatically if they would reveal contradictory information. Divination, scrying, magic that detects identities, and similar effects treat her as if she were her nemesis.

The Infernal can reuse this Charm reflexively when its duration ends to sustain the transformation. Otherwise, she reverts back to her true form. Any magic affecting her ends, as do any other effects or conditions the Storyteller deems incompatible with her true nature. If her nemesis has any Charms or other magic that she’s capable of learning, she may incur experience debt to learn up to (higher of Essence or 3) of them.
## Reset
Once the Infernal uses this Charm on a character, she can’t use it on any other character for the rest of the story.
