The wielder’s scholarly mastery flows through her and into [[Sun’s Brush]], spelling out his opponent’s doom with every stroke. This Evocation functions like a foe-scribing gambit, but instead of writing a full message, the Exalt brands her target with one of three words: Falsehood, Ignorance, or Wickedness. The target of a successful gambit can try to hide or cover it, but it shines through disguise as a Solar caste mark (Exalted, p. 175). This Evocation is incompatible with written social influence. She may mark an opponent with each of the three words, but cannot stack the same gambit. Falsehood (Difficulty 5): When an enemy hit by this gambit lies or tells a half-truth, his brand glows, revealing the deception. Ignorance (Difficulty 3): The enemy’s brand burns with golden light whenever he attacks or makes an opposed roll against a character with a higher base [[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]] dice pool, inflicting a −3 penalty. Wickedness (Difficulty 6): This gambit can only be used against a creature of darkness. It deals ([[Intelligence]]) dice of aggravated damage (ignoring [[Hardness]]) as [[Sun’s Brush]] burns the word onto its target. Any character that sees the brand intuitively understands that its bearer is a creature of darkness. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used once per day, unless reset by introducing a fact that advances the wielder’s goals or the events of the current scene. 

## Resonant

The [[Initiative]] cost of a successful gambit is waived.
