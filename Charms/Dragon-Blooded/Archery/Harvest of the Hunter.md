*The Dragon-Blood may go to hunt with an empty quiver yet never lack for arrows.*
Anything that grows will yield up arrows to the archer’s gathering hands. She can create useable ammunition for a bow or [[Crossbow]] from any kind of plant, whether it’s a marsh reed or a stalk of corn. In combat, she doubles 8s on an ammunition check for an [[Archery]] weapon (Exalted, p. 202). As long as she rolls a single success, she’s guaranteed to scavenge a single arrow. Outside of combat, she may use this Charm to gather enough arrows to fill her quiver as long as there’s sufficient plant life to draw her harvest from, although the Storyteller may require a special ammunition check to create arrows in barren deserts or other areas devoid of plant life.
