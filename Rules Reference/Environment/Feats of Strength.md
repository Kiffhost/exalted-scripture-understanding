  - Feats of Demolition

Feats of strength and feats of destruction are Strength + Athletics actions, with a difficulty determined by the [[#chart]] below. Light objects can just be picked up—no roll is necessary to lift a sword or saddle. If you want to lift a boulder blocking a mountain pass or kick down an iron-banded oak door, that’s a feat of strength. ***Characters must have a Strength rating of at least 3 to attempt any feat of strength, with more extraordinary feats having higher minimums per the [[#Chart]].***

In the case of feats of strength to destroy an object, using a tool that would logically assist adds 1 automatic success to the attempt. If the tool is an artifact weapon, add 2. 

In combat, it’s generally a good idea to ignore these rules and allow characters to use [[Stunt|stunts]] to automatically break things, as long as those things aren’t tactically significant to the battle or important to the story, and so long as it’s within the scope of what the character might be able to accomplish. Also, you can allow feats of strength to automatically succeed if the character’s dice pool is three times the difficulty or more.

Note that even though the Exalted may be able to exercise divine strength beyond the limits of mortal men, they’re still constrained by their size—no matter how strong a Solar is, he still can’t uproot a mountain, because there’s no way for him to get leverage on something that big. At best, he could tear loose great boulders, or rip open a seam in a cliff face with his hands. 

Finally, while these rules establish a baseline, Storytellers are encouraged to modify them to represent particularly dramatic situations or according to common sense. 
<details><summary>Example: Holding up a collapsing building</summary>
For example, a Solar hero might attempt to hold up a collapsing building while her Circlemates rescue the mortals trapped within. The Storyteller decides to model this as an extended (Strength + Athletics) roll with an interval of one minute and a terminus of 5, but no goal number. At each interval, the Solar must successfully match the given difficulty to hold up the collapsing building, with failure causing the Lawgiver to take bashing damage and the terminus to decrease by 1, and a botch signaling the complete collapse of the structure. At the action’s terminus, the Solar takes even more damage, and then the feat begins anew with a higher difficulty. This adaptation creates a tense and dramatic rescue scene, highlighting the Solar’s incredible strength and dedication. In another, simpler example, a martial arts tournament challenges its competitors to break various hard substances (such as wood, blocks of ice, and finally stones) with their fists to prove their fitness to compete. Since this is a test of a character’s Martial Arts prowess, it becomes appropriate to substitute (Strength + Martial Arts) in place of (Strength + Athletics).
