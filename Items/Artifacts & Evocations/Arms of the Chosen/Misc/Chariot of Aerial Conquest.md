The Chariot of Aerial Conquest is a wondrous battle-airship of a lost age, when the Chosen waged war amid the skies and imposed their will through terror. It resembles a five-sided howdah large enough to bear over two dozen men, but is plated with armor of orichalcum and jade that renders it impervious to all but the deadliest attacks. It requires that a hearthstone be socketed into the crystalline control arrays at the fore of the ship to provide an uninterrupted flow of geomantic power. Using a hearthstone to power the Chariot denies its master its mote regeneration, but doesn’t impede its other effects.

Once fully powered, a screen of blue jade in the foremost side turns transparent, allowing the pilot to see outside as she directs the ship, flying as high as thirty yards off the ground. In combat, it can fly up to long range above the ground and allows the pilot to roll movement actions with (Wits + Sail + Maneuverability). All occupants benefit from full cover, although enemies can use custom gambits to disable or breach the Chariot. Each of the Chariot’s other four sides can be lowered to board or debark while landed; they also feature armored arrow-slits that can be opened in flight, providing heavy cover for archers who fire through them. Once the Chariot has lifted off, its propulsion is silent. Blue jade alloyed in its hull camouflages it by blending with the color of the sky, making it impossible to notice without a difficulty 4 (Perception + Awareness) roll until it begins landing.

# Cargo

The chariot can carry two tons of cargo, or forty standing men in tight quarters.
