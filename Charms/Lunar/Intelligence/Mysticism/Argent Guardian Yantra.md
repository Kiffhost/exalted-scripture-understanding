She traces out either a circle of anima, extending out to short range from her, or a line of anima extending from her to a point within short range. She rolls (Intelligence + [Integrity, Lore, or Occult]) to determine the ward’s strength. Hostile spirits and fae with Resolve lower than her successes can’t cross the ward or attack through it, although those inside a circle whenitformsmaypassthroughtoexitit.Entitieswhose Essence exceeds the Lunar’s may spend one Willpower to ignore the ward for the scene. This Charm ends if the Lunar leaves the circle or crosses her own line.
