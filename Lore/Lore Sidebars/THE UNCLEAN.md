In Immaculate fables, these Anathema were by far the most avaricious and power-hungry of their kind. In their wickedness, they struck bargains with demons and other vile spirits, gaining forbidden knowledge and the secrets of darkest sorcery. No sacrifice was too extreme for these Anathema—they fed entire cities to their patrons, and allowed horrors from beyond to sate carnal hungers on their own flesh. In the end, their illgotten power could not save them from the Ten Thousand Dragons, who stood fast against their wicked magic and slew them. To this day, they are remembered as the Unclean—forever stained by their perversions and by the vile forces they bargained with.
