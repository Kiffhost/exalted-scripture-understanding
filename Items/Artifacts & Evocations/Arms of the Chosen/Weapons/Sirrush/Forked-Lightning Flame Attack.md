*As forked lightning peppers the earth, [[Sirrush]] sprays the air with fire.*
The Exalt applies a single decisive attack roll against up to ([[Wits]]) opponents within an 180-degree arc in front of the wielder. This cannot target opponents behind cover. Divide up her [[Initiative]] equally among all targets hit, rounded up, for rolling damage, up to a maximum of the wielder’s (Essence + 3) dice per target. Against battle groups, there’s no limit on how much damage is rolled and the wielder doubles 10s. 
After activating this Evocation, the wielder must make an ammunition check. 
This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing a non-trivial enemy or routing a battle group.
