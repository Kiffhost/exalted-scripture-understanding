*As the Sidereal shows her esteem for a trusted lieutenant, vermillion stardust enfolds him like a swirling banner.*
Though it quickly fades, her lieutenant can hear it blowing in the wind whenever he relies on the Sidereal’s teachings.
The Sidereal blesses a character with a Major or Defining Tie of respect, loyalty, or awe toward her, promoting him as a trusted lieutenant.
He gains the following benefits
- Whenever he’s faced with a decision involving violence, warfare, or military leadership, he intuitively knows what decision the Sidereal would make in his place. If the Sidereal has Wise Choice (p. 296), she can use it to evaluate his options from afar, though only the lieutenant receives this information. This doesn’t lend him the Sidereal’s skill as a leader or strategist, but it does let him avoid penalties on Strategic Maneuver rolls from lacking information if the Sidereal has that information.
- He gains +2 Resolve against influence opposed by a Tie of loyalty, respect, or awe to the Sidereal.
- The Sidereal can waive the cost of a single Ascending (Caste) Horoscope used on him. Using this Charm counts as a suitable interaction to use any of these Charms, letting the Sidereal use one reflexively.
- If the Sidereal has Efficacious Formulation of Strategy, she can use it from afar whenever her lieutenant makes a Strategic Maneuver roll.
- If the Sidereal has Charms that let her player ask the Storyteller questions, like Eye for Strife (p.
225), she can use them from afar to evaluate the lieutenant’s current circumstances. For instance, she could use Eye for Strife to reveal the best way to provoke someone her lieutenant’s currently dealing with. Only the lieutenant receives this information.
The Sidereal can have up to (Essence) lieutenants at a time.
