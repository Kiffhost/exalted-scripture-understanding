*When the necromancer shapes necromancy and stunts it with a description of how she casts the spell through the Skull Diary and the screaming of the skulls she possesses, she gains ([[Stunt]] rating + 2) necromantic motes towards the spell.*
Once per scene, unless stunting to enhance the necromancer’s control spell.
