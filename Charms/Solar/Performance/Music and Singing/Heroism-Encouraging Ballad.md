*The Lawgiver’s music is a benison against fear.*
While playing this song, the Lawgiver is immune to terror, and may target another character who can hear her song, making him completely immune to fear-based effects as well. Alternately, the Solar can inspire heroism in multiple allies, doubling [[Intimacy]]-derived [[Resolve]] bonuses from any applicable [[Intimacy|Tie]] or [[Intimacy|Principle]]: so long as there is a reason to be brave, her allies are emboldened against threaten actions and supernatural fear-based effects. Lastly, when the Lawgiver plays this song on the battlefield, allied battle groups gain (Solar’s [[Essence]]) automatic successes to rally for numbers (p. 210). While using this Charm, the Solar can’t take any non-Reflexive actions. Bonuses from this Charm count as dice added by a Charm.
