*At the confluence of mastered senses, the Solar feels second sight growing in her heart.*
In the moment battle begins, her [[Awakening Eye]] reads the flow of [[Initiative]] and makes her aware of attacks that will happen in the near future. This Charm supplements a [[Join Battle]] roll with a free full ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) Excellency, and by creating a cascading reroll of 10s. For every 10 rolled, reroll one nonsuccess. Non-successes which reroll 10s provoke more rerolls until a 10 fails to appear in the result. In addition, mark down how many non-successes became successes during the reroll process; every rerolled success adds one to a pool of automatic successes the Solar may use to detect hidden opponents until combat ends. These bonus successes are depleted when the Exalt uses them, though she may choose when and how many successes to use, spreading a number of successes over a number of attempts.
