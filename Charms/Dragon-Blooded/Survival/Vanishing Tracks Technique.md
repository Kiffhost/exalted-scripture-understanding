*The Dragon-Blood is a master of moving without trace, and can obscure the passage of others with her mastery.*
She rerolls 6s on a roll to cover her tracks. She may conceal the spoor of her Sworn Kin and ([[Essence]]) additional characters, allowing them to use half of her rolled successes (rounded up) in place of their own result if itâ€™s higher.
