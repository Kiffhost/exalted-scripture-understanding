Flickering into nothingness for a second, the Exalt lets her foe pass through her. When an enemy in close range attacks Kaijin’s wearer, she may use this Evocation to clash with a difficulty 3 gambit rolled with ([[Wits]] + [[Dodge]]). If successful, she may either reflexively move one range band away from him, or cause him to move one range band past her (and potentially into a hazard, over a cliff, and so on). For every threshold success on the gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll, she steals one point of [[Initiative]] from him. This doesn’t count as the wearer’s combat action. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by succeeding on a disengage roll and moving out of close range from all enemies. 

## Resonant

The gambit’s [[Initiative]] cost is waived.
