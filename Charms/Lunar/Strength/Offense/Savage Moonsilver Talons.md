Honing her strike with murderous fury, the Lunar rends through foes. She attacks an enemy whose Initiative is at least 15 lower than hers. On a withering attack, she doubles attack roll extra successes to determine raw damage. On a decisive attack, she adds attack roll extra successes as damage dice. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Lunarâ€™s Initiative and then crashing an enemy.
