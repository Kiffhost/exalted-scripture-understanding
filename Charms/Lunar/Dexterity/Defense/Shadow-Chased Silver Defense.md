Embodying predator and prey, the Lunar impossibly moves away and toward her foe simultaneously, both evading and intercepting. She adds Evasion to her Parry, or vice versa. She can enhance her Defense with Charms that only apply when she uses that form of defense — e.g., if she added Parry to Evasion, she could enhance it with Heron Sheds Rain. She can’t add Evasion against undodgeable attacks, or Parry against unblockable attacks. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully defending against three decisive attacks from nontrivial enemies.
