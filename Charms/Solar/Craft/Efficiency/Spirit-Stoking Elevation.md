*This Charm allows the Solar to replace the experience points costs of certain [[Charms]] with an expenditure of white points at a rate of 5wxp:1xp.*
This Charm supports the costs of [[Lore]] [[Charms]] such as [[Flowing Mind Prana]] and [[Wyld-Shaping Technique]], and hypothetical [[Charms]] with experience costs in [[Occult]] or [[Medicine]]. However, it does not cover experience costs from sorcerous projects or from the [[Charms]] of other Abilities.
