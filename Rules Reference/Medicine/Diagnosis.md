Sometimes, the cause of an ailment is obvious—it requires no great skill to realize that a soldier whose arm has been hacked off is missing an arm, or that a Circlemate who was just stung by a giant scorpion might be suffering from its poison. Other times, however, the cause of a malady is less obvious, requiring diagnosis before proper treatment can be administered (forging ahead without diagnosis adds +2 to +4 to the difficulty of treating the ailment).

Diagnosing a patient can be made with a (Perception + Medicine) roll to notice hints of the ailment’s origin, or with an (Intelligence + Medicine) roll to interpret the probable cause of overt symptoms, based on whatever the Storyteller deems most appropriate. Usually diagnosis requires at least a few minutes of examination. It can be rushed to a [[miscellaneous]] action in urgent situations, but doing so increases the difficulty of the roll by +1 or +2.
