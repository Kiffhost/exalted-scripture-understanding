*The Infernal dismisses an attack with a contemptuous sneer, not even bothering to block as her raw, cosmic might pushes the blow astray.*

The Infernal can block unblockable attacks. For a one-Willpower surcharge, she adds (Willpower) as a non-Charm bonus to her Parry Alternatively, the Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to perfectly parry a source of uncountable damage. If the damage is recurring, she becomes immune to it for the rest of the scene.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by successfully parrying a decisive attacker that her attacker spent 15+ motes to enhance.
## [[Keys]]
#### Invincible Universe Emperor (Melee 5, Essence 5)
The Infernal surges with power when she successfully defends an attack with this Charm’s enhance Parry. She gains (Essence) motes, separate from her normal mote pool, and gains an additional (Essence/2, rounded up) motes at the start of each of her turns. These motes can only be spent on Charms that enhance attacks, command actions, and threaten rolls, as well as persuade rolls that are framed as direct commands. This ends if she’s hit by an attack or if she goes a round without spending these motes on an action.
