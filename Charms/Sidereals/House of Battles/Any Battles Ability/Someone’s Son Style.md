The Sidereal bears the fate of an honest soldier, aided by those who know she may one day stand in their defense. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  Any character she’s protected — either personally or by fighting in defense of their community — counts as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of gratitude toward her. 
-  She gains +1 [[Resolve]] against influence that appeals to pride, ambition, vanity, or selfinterest. 
-  She gains +1 [[Guile]] against any effect that would reveal information contradictory with her being nothing more than a soldier. 
-  Enemy generals can’t gain bonus dice from spies, informants, or traitors on Strategic Maneuver rolls against a general the Sidereal fights alongside. The Sidereal herself doesn’t gain this benefit as a general.
