*The martial artist strikes her throat, abdomen, spine, brow, and crown in a lightning-swift blur, altering the pattern of her Essence to conceal her Exaltation.*
The stylist chooses an Exalt type she’s familiar with and a Caste or Aspect, causing her anima banner and Caste Mark to take on an appropriate appearance and mimicking effects like the anima flux of the DragonBlooded. If she uses native Charms with overtly supernatural effects, they change to resemble the mimicked Exalt type’s magic. Reaching bonfire anima doesn’t disrupt resplendent destinies of that Exalt type.
The stylist adds (Anima) dice on rolls with chosen Caste or Aspect’s Attributes or Abilities and adds (Anima/2, rounded up) to static values based on them.
(Martial Arts doesn’t count as a Sidereal Caste Ability for this purpose). If a Caste or Aspect requires selecting from a list of Abilities or Attributes, like Solar Castes, the stylist must do so when she uses this Charm. If the stylist mimics an Exalt type that doesn’t have Castes, Aspects, or the other relevant traits, her player should work with the Storyteller to determine an equivalent set of rolls she receives bonuses on.
If the martial artist uses this Charm to emulate a Dragon-Blood, she can enter Elemental Aura using the Immaculate Dragon styles’ Charms or Five Jade Fury, letting her access the Immaculate Charms’ Aura benefits.
### Enlightenment
While emulating a different Caste of the stylist’s Exalt type, the stylist gains that Caste’s anima powers in addition to her own. If she uses a power with a reset, like a Greater Sign’s once-per-story limit, she can’t use any other anima powers with the same duration restriction until the initial power is reset.
