*The Infernal’s performance leaves her audience with pleasant memories of new friends, rather than the disgust and regret that follows a mixed soirée.*

As long as the Infernal performs, her audience ignores any instinctive fear or revulsion associated with others’ alien or unnerving appearances, including the effects of the Hideous Merit. The performance also suppresses any negative Minor Ties they have to groups that are forbidden or disreputable: criminals, heretical cults, foreigners, demons, Infernals, and similar groups. (This doesn’t apply to Ties to individuals.) If the Infernal performs for the entire scene without being interrupted by combat or similarly jarring events, audience members won’t recall any details about their fellow attendees they would normally consider alien, dangerous, or suspicious. Nontrivial characters can pay one Willpower to resist if given reason to question this.
