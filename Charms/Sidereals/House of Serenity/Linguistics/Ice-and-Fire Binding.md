The Sidereal recites ritual prayers for health and prosperity, binding a spirit to the Maiden of Serenity’s service. After a scene spent praying to a god or elemental with an [[Essence]] of up to (higher of Sidereal’s [[Essence]] or 3), the Sidereal rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Linguistics]]). If she prays to a fire elemental or a god associated with fire, the maximum [[Essence]] increases by one. Success summons that spirit and imposes a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of “I must ensure and defend the joy, health, and pleasure of those around me.” This [[Intimacy]] can’t be weakened or altered by any means. If that [[Intimacy]] could let the spirit treat influence as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220), he must do so. The spirit can’t use Hurry Home while bound by this Charm. Alternatively, the Sidereal can use this Charm against a spirit of any kind present in the scene. Doing so works as above, except she can recite the binding in a single turn. This binding lasts (1 + Sidereal’s extra successes) seasons. Once it ends, the Sidereal may have the spirit forget her identity and all details about her.
