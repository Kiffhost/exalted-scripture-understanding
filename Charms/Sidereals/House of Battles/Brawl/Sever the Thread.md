*The Sidereal’s awful strength rips fates and flesh asunder.*
To use this Charm, the Sidereal must have Initiative 10+.
Her decisive damage roll gains −2 target number unless her target’s player commits in advance to accepting the highest level of crippling injury possible based on the amount of damage they took. Un-Exalted enemies of fate must instead take an injury one step more severe.
This doesn’t count against the once-per-story limit on taking such injuries and renders him immune to this Charm for the scene.
