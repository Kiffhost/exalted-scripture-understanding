*In profane mockery of the gods, the necromancer rips open the flesh of reality, shaping this wound into a temporary shelter.*
The necromancer opens a bleeding fissure in the air at a point within short range. Those with her permission may pass through into a sanctum like a god’s, but with walls of polished bone and fountains of spiritual gore. This space has room to hold ([[Essence]] x5) guests comfortably, though it has no amenities.
Its interior count as a shadowland, protecting ghosts from the light of day and rendering them material, though it doesn’t open into the Underworld. It persists as long as the necromancer resides there, and for ([[Essence]]) days thereafter; beyond that, the wound in space knits itself closed. Characters and objects left within are deposited safely outside.
A necromancer who chooses her location carefully may roll ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) when casting the spell to establish the difficulty to notice it, but this suffers a −2 penalty from the blessure’s ever-weeping blood.
## Control
As a ritual, the necromancer may cast this spell upon a coffin, casket, or similar vessel meant for the dead, creating a blessure within that travels with her. If she stays in one place too long, such as when sleeping, the air begins to bleed, lightly scoured by her sheer presence.
## Distortion (8)
A rival necromancer may force open the portal to the hidden refuge for up to (his [[Essence]]) minutes.
