*The Infernal’s every brush stroke squirms with life, eager to nest in the hearts of her readers.*

The Infernal makes a written instill or persuade roll against a single target. If her influence succeeds and her target doesn’t resist with Willpower, this also counts as a separate persuade roll, compelling the target to try to convince others to read the text. He adds (Infernal’s Essence/2, rounded up) dice on influence rolls to do so. This persuasion must be supported by an Intimacy of the appropriate level, as usual (Exalted, p. 216). It costs one Willpower to resist.

This Charm’s effect lingers for (Essence + {Charisma or Manipulation}) days after it ends. Once this period elapses, the text no longer conveys this compulsion and affected characters are freed from its effect, losing the dice bonus it offers.
