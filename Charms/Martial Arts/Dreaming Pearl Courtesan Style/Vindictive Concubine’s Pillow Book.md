*Once a man has let the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan into his heart, his bedchamber, or his confidence, he is all but dead.*
[[Vindictive Concubine’s Pillow Book]] applies the double 10s rule to the damage roll of a decisive attack after the attack roll has been made. In addition, for each of the following criteria met, the next number down is doubled. 
- The martial artist is making an ambush attack against a character who already knows her.
- The martial artist possesses some knowledge of the victim’s personal life or dealings that could be potentially embarrassing or ruinous for him, and he knows that she knows it.
- The martial artist stole a point of [[Initiative]] from her victim with the [[Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata]] on her last or current turn.
- The martial artist used the [[Seven Storms [[Escape]] Prana]] and successfully overcame the enemy’s [[Resolve]] on her last or current turn (regardless of whether he spent [[Willpower]] to resist or not).

<details><summary>Example</summary>Meeting one of the listed conditions would apply double 9s, while meeting three or more would apply the maximum of double 7s.</details>

## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood can only use [[Vindictive Concubine’s Pillow Book]] once per fight, unless reset by successfully defending against a decisive attack with 15+ dice on its attack roll. 
## Mastery
The martial artist treats being in [[Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form]] as an additional criterion for doubling damage successes with this Charm. Additionally, once the martial artist has reached double 7s, any further criteria she meets add +1 to her base [[Initiative]] upon resetting.
