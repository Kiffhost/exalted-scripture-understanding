*The martial artist’s stance bends the flows of Essence around her, becoming a nexus through which the world’s breath flows.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the stylist chooses (Lore or Occult) hearthstones. She can reflexively manifest one of these hearthstones as a jewel upon her brow, committing two motes for a lesser hearthstone or four motes for a greater hearthstone. Doing so confers that hearthstone’s benefits as though it were socketed in an attuned artifact. Hearthstones that enhance weapons benefit the stylist’s unarmed attacks, while hearthstones that enhance armor apply to her natural soak.
The stylist can manifest Linked hearthstones this way, and she gains the benefits of Dependent hearthstones if she has another hearthstone socketed in any artifact she’s attuned to. Manifested hearthstones are indestructible but don’t survive the stylist’s death.
The Storyteller should veto hearthstone choices that are overpowered if made permanent, like the Gem of Incomparable Wellness.
While using a Form Charm, if the stylist makes an attack that benefits from the manifested hearthstone, she adds one die of post-soak withering or decisive damage for a lesser stone or two dice for a greater stone.
