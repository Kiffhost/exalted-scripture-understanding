*Such is the Abyssal’s dedication to her grave purpose that she remains immutable by will alone.*
When the Abyssal is exposed to a Shaping effect, she can defend with this Charm, regardless of what Ability she uses to resist. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) successes on her opposed roll or adds (higher of Essence or 3) to the targeted static value. If the Shaping effect is rolled, its 1s subtract successes.
Even if the Abyssal fails, she can pay one Willpower to mitigate the consequences. If a transformation is normally permanent, it becomes possible for the Abyssal to break it, though it’s up to her to figure out how — often with the use of Lore, Medicine, or Occult.
The Abyssal also can’t be changed in a way that kills her, leaves her unable to take any actions, or stops her from using Charms or other magic at all — at least, not immediately. The Storyteller can inflict a weakened version of the effect that develops progressively, giving the Abyssal ample time to find a way to break it, as above — seasons, or even years. Alternatively, the Storyteller can alter the transformation’s nature so that it doesn’t have such an impact on the deathknight.
With an Integrity 5, Essence 2 repurchase, Immutable Graven Mythos’s bonus becomes non-Charm. Against Shaping effects that are normally unrolled, the Abyssal rolls (Essence + current temporary Willpower) against the opposing character’s (current temporary Willpower). That character loses one success and one Willpower for each 1 or 2 that he rolls. Success negates that effect and renders the Abyssal immune to it for the rest of the session. If the Shaping isn’t created by a character, the Storyteller sets a difficulty for the Abyssal’s roll.
### Whispers
The Abyssal can invoke her Whispers instead of paying the Willpower cost to mitigate a Shaping effect’s consequences.
