The countless poisons distilled and combined within the Toad stylist strengthen her venomous strikes.
Upon using this Charm, the stylist chooses one of the following benefits for all poisons she creates for the rest of the scene. When her soak reduces a withering attack to minimum damage or her Hardness negates a decisive attack, she may choose an additional option, maximum (Stamina). She can choose the same benefit multiple times.
 - +1 Duration.
 - +1 damage.
 - Increase penalty by one.
This applies to poisons created with magic other than this style’s Charms, but not to poisons obtained mundanely and applied to weapons. It doesn’t apply retroactively to poisons the stylist has already inflicted.
