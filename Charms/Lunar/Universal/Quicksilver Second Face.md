*Reveling in protean grace, the Lunar dances between shapes.*
She can pay a two-[[Initiative]] surcharge to shapeshift reflexively on her turn, without the usual miscellaneous action [[Defense]] penalty. She may do so multiple times in one turn, but not in the middle of an action—e.g., she can’t make an attack roll in one shape, then shift into another before rolling damage. This isn’t compatible with [[Charms]] that let her shapeshift into certain forms, like [[Towering Beast Form]] or [[Emerald Grasshopper Form]]. An [[Essence]] 2 repurchase lets the Lunar reflexively shapeshift outside her turn. Among other things, this can help defend against attacks.
