The No Moon shaman Soul Orchid created Nightmare Shard as a weapon against the Gentry of Autumn’s End, a court of raksha who caught entire cities in paradise-traps of gossamer illusion, false utopias that fattened the soul for the Fair Folk to feast on even as they enthralled the senses. Soul Orchid quested into the outer reaches of chaos to steal a manifest enigma, an incomprehensible truth that could only exist in the Wyld. She forged it into moonsilver, creating a weapon that could cut through dreams to reveal the horrid reality. Nightmare Shard’s bladed edge is elegantly wrought, but its mirrored surface casts a warped and grotesque reflection of the world. These reflections are born of Soul Orchid’s own fears and nightmares realized, giving Nightmare Shard the power to cut through happiness as easily as it could flesh. The Lunar freed the Gentry’s victims and abandoned the skycutter, unable to bear its burden any longer. Nellens Radagar has recently returned to the Blessed Isle from the newly conquered satrapy of Salt, bearing Nightmare Shard as a trophy. Since his return, he’s been troubled by the dark power of his weapon, even as his family lauds him for his triumph. He smokes qat and opium to ease his troubled conscience, and takes counsel from a mysterious masked sage who returned with him from the provinces.
