Like green leaves reborn after the harshest winter, the Dragon-Blood’s arrow must inevitably strike its mark. After an attack roll, she can reroll up to ([[Essence]]) non-1 failures for one [[Initiative]] each. This Charm must be declared before the attack roll, but the [[Initiative]] isn’t paid until after the roll.
