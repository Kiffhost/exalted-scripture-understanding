Certain attacks, particularly attacks modified by some [[Charms]], are unblockable, undodgeable, or both. An unblockable attack bypasses [[Defense|Parry]] entirely, necessitating an application of [[Defense|Evasion]] to defend against. Likewise, an undodgeable attack bypasses [[Defense|Evasion]]. Using an attack thatâ€™s rolled but both unblockable and undodgeable is a difficulty zero action (p. 186).
