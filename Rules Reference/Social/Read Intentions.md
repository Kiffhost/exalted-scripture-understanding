The read intentions action allows a character to discern what another character wants to achieve in a scene of interaction. Reading someone’s intentions is not an [[Social Influence#Influence roll|influence roll]]—instead, it is a ([[Perception]] + [[Socialize]]) roll against the target’s [[Guile]]. On a success, the Storyteller should give a brief description of what the character wants out of the interaction: “He’s seducing you to get you alone,” or “She’s making polite small talk and waiting for this party to end.”

*A character who is unaware they’re being observed suffers a -2 penalty to their [[Guile]].*

Alternatively, this action can be used in order to determine what [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] a character has. Before rolling for the action, the player should generally describe what kind of [[Intimacy]] he wants to discern (“Does he love anyone?” “How does he feel about me?” “Is he a devout Immaculate?”). On a success, the Storyteller chooses and reveals one of the target’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that fits those criteria. If there is no [[Intimacy]] that does, the Storyteller should let the player know this.

The read intentions action is not a form of magic. The character using it is analyzing the target’s words and behavior to get a better feel for his motives and [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], and the Storyteller should use common sense in deciding how much information can be gleaned from a character’s behavior and appearance. You might deduce that a young princeling is in love from a look of longing in his eyes or a wistful sigh, but discerning his paramour’s identity might be impossible unless she’s physically present or if he’s carrying some evidence of her identity.
# Retry
Once a [[Read Intentions]] action has failed, it can’t be retried on the same target for the rest of the scene.
