*Strumming the threads of fate, the stylist shakes loose curses and predictions.*
The stylist attempts to undo a fate-altering Shaping effect on herself or another touched character. She and the character responsible for the effect make opposed (Intelligence + {Lore or Occult}) rolls. Against environmental effects and the like, the Storyteller sets a difficulty. If the stylist fails, she can’t reuse this Charm on that effect.
This Charm can also unravel a Sidereal’s resplendent destinies. If the stylist succeeds on her roll, she may fray one of a target’s resplendent destinies (p. 142) or destroy a destiny that’s already been frayed.
### Enlightenment
With Martial Arts 5, Essence 4, the stylist permanently gains the ability to sense prophecies (p. 143), becoming aware of their presence whenever they alter a roll’s target number in a scene that she’s in.
This doesn’t reveal any additional information, like the prophecy’s nature or purpose. The stylist can use this Charm to negate prophecies by touching an affected nontrivial character. The Sidereal who created the prophecy adds non-Charm successes on his opposing roll equal to the prophecy’s highest Ambition Factor.
