The Dragon-Blood strikes down arrow and archer with a single shot. When she wins a clash with [[Dragonfly Finds Mate]] while in Wood Aura, she may spend one [[Willpower]] to send her arrow flying toward the enemy who attacked her as a decisive attack that uses the same attack roll. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by using [[Dragonfly Finds Mate]] to successfully clash a decisive attack made by a nontrivial foe with 15+ [[Initiative]].
