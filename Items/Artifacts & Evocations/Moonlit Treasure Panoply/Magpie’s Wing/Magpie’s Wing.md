Vorsay Red-Veiled forged [[Magpie’s Wing]] in his early days as one of Luna’s Chosen, before he rose to fame as a legendary thief-king of the First Age. In his mortal life, he’d been a criminal, running contraband past the Old Realm’s enforcers, and he put every smuggler’s trick he’d learned into Magpie’s Wing’s ingenious design.
More than just a weapon, its mirrored surface conceals hidden chambers, thieves’ tools, and intricate mechanisms of fluid moonsilver.
The skycutter’s design resembles its namesake bird, with the skycutter’s three-foot blade forming its feathered wings. The stylized magpie’s head bears what seems to be a hearthstone slot, socketed with a red stone — but in truth, the hearthstone is a fake, concealing a hidden compartment within the [[skycutter]]. Its actual hearthstone socket is formed by the magpie’s talons, near the skycutter’s grip, which will grasp a stone placed in them. Some among its wielders say it has a larcenous streak, that its metal and [[Essence]] yearn to be put to use for underhanded purposes.
[[Magpie’s Wing]] accompanied Vorsay on all his storied crimes. Countless treasures disappeared into its deceptively large secret compartment: the cursed jewels of Dis, a faerie prince’s hoard of souls, and most famously, the Crown of Thunders. None know how he met his end, nor what his final heist was — only that he never returned from it. [[Magpie’s Wing]] remains lost with him, despite the efforts of some in the [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] to retrieve it. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the [[Magpie’s Wing]]

Magpie’s Wing’s [[Evocations]] center around the skycutter’s mutable form and secret compartment, aiding the wielder in larcenous endeavors.
The skycutter’s secret compartment is exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for concealing an object up to the size of a hen’s egg or a hearthstone within it.
Upon attuning to it, the wielder awakens [[Corvid’s Many Secrets]] for free.
