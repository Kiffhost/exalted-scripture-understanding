The constellation of the Sword governs death by illness. When [[Doom-Gathering Arc]] deals damage, it always leaves an infected wound, even on the Exalted (Exalted, p. 235). This illness is written in the stars; it has morbidity (Doom + 2) and cannot be cured without magic. 

## Resonant

The infection spreads with unnatural haste; its interval is one day.
