*The Lunar leads her pack from the front line, inspiring them with her might.*
She rerolls ([[Strength]]) failed dice on an [[Appearance]]-based [[command]] roll. If this leaves her roll without any 1s and with at least one 10, she gains one [[Initiative]]. 
## Totemic 
A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
