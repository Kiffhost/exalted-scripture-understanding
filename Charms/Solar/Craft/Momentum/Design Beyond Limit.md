# Arms of the Chosen Errata

The Solar tempers an artifact to awaken even greater depths of power. She spends (10 – Essence) hours reforging an artifact with a rating of 3+ dots in a wellstocked workshop. Upon completion, the artifact’s master may instantly awaken a single Evocation of his choice (including custom Evocations) that he meets the prerequisites for without spending experience points. Design Beyond Limit may awaken Evocations beyond the normal maximum an artifact can sustain (p. 18). An artifact may only benefit from a single use of this Charm per story

# Pre-Errata

A Solar who has the power to build an Artifact may also temper it with greater power. To use this Charm, the Exalt must have an Artifact weapon to work with, and the owner of the weapon must have unlocked all of its Evocations. Typically this means the Artifact has a rating of three or four dots, as Artifacts rated five or N/A usually have no known limit to their number of inactive Evocations. With this Charm, the Exalt spends (10 - Essence) hours reforging the weapon in her workshop. When she is finished, the weapon gains one new Emerald, Sapphire, and Adamant Evocation. Each of these Evocations is inactive and must still be learned. If the weapon does not belong to the Solar, the experience points cost can be paid by the weapon’s owner. This Charm may not be used twice on the same weapon until the added Evocations have been mastered. The nature of added Evocations will reflect the wielder’s spirit, the weapon’s attitude and character, and the forger’s design.
