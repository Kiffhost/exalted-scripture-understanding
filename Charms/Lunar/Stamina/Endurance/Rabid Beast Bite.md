Suffusing a blow with septic Essence, the Lunar leaves festering wounds. An enemy damaged by a decisive attack with an unarmed strike or natural weapons is exposed to an enhanced form of infected wounds (Exalted, p. 235). The disease uses (Lunar’s Stamina) in place of its morbidity and virulence if higher, and can infect characters with Exalted Healing. Crashed foes and trivial characters acquire the infection at Major intensity on a failed roll. Alternatively, the Lunar may use this Charm to transmit any disease she’s currently suffering from. This doesn’t enhance its morbidity or virulence. She can’t transmit incurable diseases like the Great Contagion.
