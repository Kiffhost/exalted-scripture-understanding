The Solar hardens her heart, forcefully reinstating her values in the face of successful influence. After being persuaded to take a Major or Defining course of action, this Charm allows the Solar to deny the influence, even if this means asserting the [[Intimacy]] that might have been used to raise her [[Resolve]]. Her opponent’s argument was compelling, but she cannot deny her own principles. This Charm may only be used once per story, but is reset if the Solar witnesses the defense or upholding of a Defining Principle as a result of changing her mind. For example, a Lawgiver who is persuaded to withdraw her army from the border might reject that persuasion, going back on her decision to withdraw. When a beastman horde suddenly rushes the border and her army is still there and able to prevent the invasion, and if she has a Defining Principle such as “I will defend my kingdom from foreign invaders,” she will see that her decision to change her mind was justified and necessary, and [[Steel Heart Stance]] will be reset.
