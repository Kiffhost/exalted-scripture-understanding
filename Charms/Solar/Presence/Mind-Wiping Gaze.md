The Solar sheds the entire force of her presence out through her eyes. Her intense stare penetrates the soul of her target, momentarily blanking out his memories. When the Exalt perceives a character who is about to make a social influence attempt she disagrees with (or wishes to stifle for whatever reason), she may use this Charm, rolling a ([Charisma or Appearance] + Presence) action against her targetâ€™s Resolve to extinguish the candle of his mind. If successful, her target forgets his social objective for the rest of the scene, and may only remember it if reminded and then by paying one Willpower. The Solar may only use this Charm on a given target once per scene. If her target spends a Willpower to resist, the Solar regains the Willpower she spent activating the Charm. Mind-Wiping Gaze may be enhanced by Presence Charms that enhance persuade and threaten actions.
