The Sidereal seems to flicker from rather than move, appearing at her destination in the instant she vanishes. The Sidereal can pay a two-mote surcharge when she uses [[Inexorable Advance]] to move between range bands (including with a reflexive move action). She moves without crossing the space between, circumventing difficult terrain, [[environmental hazards]], and the like. A clear path must exist; she can’t move through walls.
