The fiddler’s tune commands a fearsome swarm, vexing foes with their biting mandibles.
When the Lunar uses [[Thousandfold Wasp Dance]], the swarming hazard never damages her allies. She may pay a two-[[Initiative]] surcharge to add +2 to the hazard’s Damage.
## Resonant
If the Lunar pays the [[Initiative]] surcharge, the swarm counts as difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) for enemies.
