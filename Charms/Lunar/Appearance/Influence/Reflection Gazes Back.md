Those who seek to understand the Lunar see only what she chooses to reveal. When a character the Lunar is aware of rolls to read her intentions, she reflexively makes an influence roll to threaten him, seduce him, or instill in him a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear or desire toward her. Each 1 on the opposing character’s roll adds a non-Charm die to the Lunar’s roll. If the opposing character fails his read intentions roll, his 1s also subtract from his [[Resolve]].
