The Dragon-Blood moves through forests with unfettered grace, scaling the highest trees and dancing effortlessly along the leaves of the canopy. She can walk on branches, leaves, or similar living plant-based surfaces with perfect balance, able to stand and cross over them even if they couldn’t normally bear her weight and never needing a roll to maintain her balance no matter how narrowtheyare.Aslongasshe’sstandingonsuchaplantbased surface, she gains +1 Evasion. In addition, she may use her reflexive move action to move one or two range bands up or down a tree or similar plant-based surface, as long as there’s a horizontal surface on which she can stand at the end of her movement (or if she uses Incense Smoke Ladder to continue moving up it).
