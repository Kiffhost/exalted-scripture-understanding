*Honing her focus and concentration beyond the limits of human perception, the Dragon-Blood unleashes arcing lighting along her bladeâ€™s edge, guiding it to strike true.*
When she makes an attack that benefits from aiming, she rerolls ([[Essence]]) non-1 failures on both an attack and damage roll. If her enemy is wearing metal armor (including artifact armor made from the five magical materials), she adds its mobility penalty to the number of failures she can reroll.
A [[Melee]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Dragon-Blood pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge while in Air Aura to reflexively aim against an enemy wearing metal armor before attacking with this Charm.
