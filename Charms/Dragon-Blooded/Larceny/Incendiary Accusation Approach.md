Every criminal knows that they’re playing with fire, but those who dare to cheat the Dragon-Blood discover just how true that is. When she uses this Charm’s prerequisite to detect a character cheating or using Larceny, she may pay an additional one mote and one Willpower to cause a small fire to ignite on his person, revealing his misdeeds to all and rolling a single die of lethal damage against him, ignoring Hardness. A cheating gambler’s illicit cards go up in flames, while a pickpocket is caught literally red-handed.
