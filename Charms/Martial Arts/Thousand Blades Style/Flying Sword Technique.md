*The stylist unleashes one of her flying weapons to strike a distant foe.*
The stylist makes a withering or decisive attack against an enemy at short range, adding (Arsenal) dice on the attack roll. This increases to medium range at Arsenal 3+ and long range at Arsenal 5+. Her weapon returns to her side after the attack.
## Mastery
The stylist increases the attack’s range by an additional band. This doesn’t let her attack at extreme range until she reaches [[Essence]] 3.
## Terrestrial
The stylist can’t attack beyond medium range.
