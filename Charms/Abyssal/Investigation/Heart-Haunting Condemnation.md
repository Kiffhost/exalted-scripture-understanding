*Those who defy the justice of Death’s Lawgiver must face the wrath of the dead, tormented by accusing specters and dreams of chains.*
The Abyssal makes a ({Charisma, [[Manipulation]], or Wits} + [[Investigation]]) threaten roll, accusing someone of a crime or wrongdoing and urging him to confess and face punishment, provide restitution to his victims, or otherwise atone. She doubles 8s if she presents evidence of her claim, or doubles 7s if the evidence is conclusively damning. If she beats his [[Resolve]] but he spends [[Willpower]] to resist this influence, he’s cursed to face the Abyssal’s justice.
Each night, the cursed character is beset by haunting apparitions, eerie omens, and awful nightmares, echoing the Abyssal’s accusations. Their psychological impact is represented by the deathknight repeating her influence with another threaten roll, as above, which she can enhance with magic as usual.
Against mortals with [[Willpower]] less than or equal to the deathknight’s [[Essence]] and trivial characters, a successful roll may result in them being haunted to death should the Abyssal wish it, found drained of blood or entirely bleached of color.
This haunting counts as a sorcerous curse. It ends once the Abyssal has made a number of additional rolls equal to her extra successes, minimum one.
With [[Essence]] 5, when the Abyssal uses [[Lingering Echoes of Anguish]] to witness a crime or wrongdoing that offends one of her Defining Intimacies, she can use this Charm from afar, paying a thirteen-mote surcharge. Her initial threaten roll is conveyed by a haunting manifestation, no matter where her target may be. She can only do so once per story.
## Reset
