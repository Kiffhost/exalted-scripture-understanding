*Riding straight out of nightmares, the Infernal’s steed moves like nothing that belongs in this world, a whirlwind of toxic dreams.*

The Infernal’s mount moves one range bands in any direction. Its movements are disjointed and nightmarish: the Infernal rolls ({Appearance or Wits} + Ride) to inspire fear in all who see it. It can traverse any surface, horizontal or vertical, including non-solid surfaces like water, clouds, or chimney-smoke. If the Infernal uses this Charm while within close range of an enemy, she also treats her roll as a disengage against them. If she fails, she’s unable to move.

The Infernal’s mount dissolves partially into hallucinogenic mist in motion. If its movement brings it within close range of an enemy, he’s exposed to a poison with Damage 2i/round, Duration (Infernal’s successes) rounds, and a −3 penalty. If an enemy’s Resolve was beaten by the Infernal’s influence, his 1s subtract successes from his roll against the poison. The poison doesn’t deal decisive damage to crashed enemies — instead, they lose that many points of Willpower.
## [[Keys]]
#### Crimson Gust Ride
The Infernal may have her mount partially dissolve into crimson wind instead of poisonous vapor, making it utterly silent in motion. Instead of poison, enemies face a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 4A.
#### Living Shadow Gallop
When the Infernal uses this Charm while in darkness, she and her mount may dissolve into shadow-stuff, capable of passing mundane barriers and obstacles as long as even the slightest opening exists. She must end her movement in darkness as well, but can sense the presence of shadows she could travel to even if she can’t see them. This replaces the Charm’s poison.
#### Sand-Racing Sirocco Charge
The Infernal may have her mount partially dissolve into swirling sand. Instead of poison, enemies face a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage (Infernal’s Essence, maximum 5)B. Enemies damaged by the hazard are blinded until the end of their next turn, suffering a −3 visibility penalty on vision-based actions.
#### Demon Lancer Charge (Ride 5, Essence 3) (+3m)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote surcharge to reflexively make a withering or decisive attack at any point during her movement.
#### Land-Wracking Hurricane Run (Ride 5, Essence 3) (+2m, 2i)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote, two-Initiative surcharge to move up to two range bands with this Charm, or three range bands while using [[Beast of Proud Bearing]].
#### Typhoon-Dragging Carriage (+2m, 2i, Essence 3, any two keys)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote, two-Initiative surcharge to expand the poison out to short range from her path.
