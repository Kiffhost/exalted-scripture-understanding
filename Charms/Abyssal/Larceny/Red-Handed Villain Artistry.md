*The Abyssal leaves a macabre signature for investigators, whether a grisly message written in blood or a rose left in place of stolen treasures, stirring both revulsion and obsession.*
When the Abyssal leaves behind a message, calling card, or other distinctive signature as part of a conceal evidence roll, she adds (Charisma or Manipulation) dice. Her roll also counts as an influence roll against anyone who cases the scene. By default, this can either be a threaten roll or an instill roll to create Ties of obsession, hatred, or morbid fascination with the crime’s perpetrator, but the Storyteller can allow other rolls that fit the deathknight’s crime scene.
If an investigator’s Resolve is beaten by the Abyssal’s influence, his case scene roll suffers a penalty equal to her threshold successes, minimum (Abyssal’s Essence), and his 1s subtract successes, even if he spends Willpower to resist. Failure represents the target being so fixated on the Abyssal’s grisly signature or his preconceptions about the suspect that he overlooks actual evidence.
