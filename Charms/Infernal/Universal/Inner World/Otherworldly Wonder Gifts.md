*The Infernal brings forth strange treasures and unworldly allies from her inner world.*

When the Infernal uses [[Sanctum-Soul Threshold Meditation]] to leave her inner world, she can bring its objects or inhabitants with her. Typically, this requires her to make an introduce fact roll to add them to her inner world before this, or otherwise create them from inner world’s raw materials.

The Infernal must pay separately for each object or willing inhabitant she wishes to bring with her. She can pay two motes to bring an object light enough for her to carry, or five motes for objects up to the size of a person. She can’t bring artifacts or other supernatural things, except for those she’s created herself within the inner world.

The Infernal can pay one mote to bring an inhabitant of her inner world that’s equivalent in strength to a one-dot [[Familiar]] (Exalted, p. 161), or five motes for an inhabitant equivalent to a mortal human or a two-dot Familiar. She can’t bring more formidable beasts or supernatural creatures with her. Note that these inhabitants aren’t loyal to the Infernal by default. She can’t bring artifacts, supernatural creatures, or the like with her, except for artifacts she’s created herself and other things made through her own prowess, rather than reshaping her inner world.
