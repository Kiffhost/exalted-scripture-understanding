When all else fails, pain and intimidation are brutally effective motivators. Sometimes also called an intimidate action, threaten works like a [[Bargain]]: You can convince people to do things without having to appeal to their [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], only rather than offering something they want, you present them with something they don’t—usually the threat of bodily harm, although social blackmail, economic ruin, and general intimidation will also do the job. It can also be used as an [[Instill]] action which gives the target a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear towards you, or intensifies such an [[Intimacy]] he already has. For a threaten action to be effective, the target must be more afraid of the consequences of refusing you than he is of whatever you want him to do. If the target has any awe- or fear-based [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] you’re aware of, that’s usually a good place to start

Blackmail and bullying won’t make you many friends. Using the threaten action on someone almost always causes him to form an immediate negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards you, with a context chosen by the target’s player, regardless of whether the attempt succeeds or fails. It can also often weaken any existing positive Ties the target might have, although that’s ultimately up to his player ([[Intimacy#Gaining Intimacies]]).
# Retry
You can only retry a failed [[Threaten]] roll if you significantly escalate the threat used to coerce your target.

A torturer might progress from light cuts to broken bones to potentially lethal torture. A scheming eunuch who fails to cow a court rival with the threat of revealing an illicit affair might threaten to frame him for treason. A Solar might flare his anima banner, revealing that the threat behind his menacing glare is far, far greater than his foes first realized.
