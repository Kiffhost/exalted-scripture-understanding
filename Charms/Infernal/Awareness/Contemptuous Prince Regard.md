*The Infernal regards a broken world bereft of its true masters and sneers at what the treachery of the gods has wrought.*

The Infernal adds one die on an Awareness roll for each condition that applies:
- The Infernal is observing or searching for someone or something that she has a negative Tie toward.
- The Infernal is observing or searching for a character whose Essence is lower than hers or who’s a mortal or First Circle demon.
- The Infernal is searching for something she wishes to harm or something she can use to cause harm.
- The Infernal is looking down from an elevated position or observing someone lying prone.

If the Infernal beats a character’s Larceny or Stealth with her roll, that character subtracts one success from his total to determine whether other characters beat his roll.
## Special activation rules
This Charm’s duration can be extended as per the [[Infernal Awareness vs. Multiple Foes|Awareness Excellency]].
### Keys 
#### Unblinking Hatred Awareness
The Infernal can always use this Charm after an Awareness roll.
#### World-Scorning Scrutiny (Essence 2) (+2m)
For a two-mote surcharge, the added dice are non-Charm. Every two extra successes the Infernal rolls subtracts an additional success from an opposing character’s roll, up to one additional success per condition met.
#### Omniscient Malevolence Meditation (Awareness 5, Essence 3, [[#World-Scorning Scrutiny (Essence 2) (+2m)|World-Scorning Scrutiny]]) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, the Infernal makes two rolls and keeps the higher result. The Willpower surcharge is waived if she meets at least two conditions. If she uses this key after an Awareness roll using [[#Unblinking Hatred Awareness]], she rerolls all dice, both failures and successes, and keeps the higher of the two results. She can activate additional Charms to enhance the reroll, in addition to the Charms used on the original roll.
