*The Lunar binds her mightiest prey’s [[Essence]] into wonders worthy of the hunt.*
Upon beginning a superior project with any Attribute to create an artifact that incorporates the remains of a supernatural creature she participated in slaying, she gains (its [[Essence]] x2) gold points, which must be spent toward the project’s interval rolls or the costs of [[Charms]] enhancing it. Upon completion, the Lunar rolls (prey’s [[Essence]]), awakening one Evocation whose prerequisites she meets at no experience cost for every two successes, minimum one Evocation. Alternatively, she may awaken [[Evocations]] for another character that participated in slaying the quarry, or for her Solar mate. This Charm can only be used once per story.
