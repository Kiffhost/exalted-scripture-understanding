The sorcerer may warp the substance of chaos to her will. She doubles 8s on any shape sorcery rolls made in the Wyld, and can perform sorcerous workings without needing to pay experience costs. However, such miracles fade to shadow outside the Wyld. If she used a free working to give herself opalescent wings, they would fade away as soon as she entered Creation, only to reappear when she returns to the Wyld. A palace enchanted to fly could do so freely through the skies of chaos, but would fall subject to gravity in Creation. The Storyteller may retroactively charge the player experience points for any working that circumvents or cheats this limitation in play
