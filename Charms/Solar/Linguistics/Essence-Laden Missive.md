*The Exalt can infuse a short statement with [[Essence]], such that the [[Essence]] travels through the reader’s mind to escape through his tongue.*
A character who reads such a missive will immediately and unironically repeat the statement he just read without realizing he’s doing so. This is not a Charm which simply forces the character to read aloud, but rather causes him to announce the missive. The roll to determine whether the reader blurts out the missive is treated as a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Linguistics]]) inspire action with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes.
