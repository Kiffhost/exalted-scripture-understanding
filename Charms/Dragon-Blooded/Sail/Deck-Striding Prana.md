No landlubber she, the Dragon-Blood crosses over storm-tossed decks or windswept rigging with fluid grace. She adds (Sail) bonus dice on a movement roll or a roll to maintain her balance, or may use her reflexive move action to ascend or descend one vertical range band up a ship’s rigging, a ladder that spans decks, or similar nautical scenery without needing to roll. In Water Aura, this Charm’s Initiative cost is waived and it loses the Perilous keyword.
