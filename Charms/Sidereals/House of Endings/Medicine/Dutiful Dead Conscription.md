*The Sidereal deputizes the dead into fate’s service, offering them a chance to pass on into the next life in exchange for their assistance.*
She requests that a ghost undertake a serious or life-changing task (Exalted, p. 216) in service to herself, destiny, or the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]. If the ghost accepts, the Sidereal’s [[Essence]] crystallizes into an amethyst butterfly broach, a badge of the authority with which she invests him. He gains the following benefits: 
- He gains a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] toward completing that task, which can’t be weakened or altered by any means. 
- Once per scene, he may gain −1 target number on a roll that’s part of that task. 
- He can use the Sidereal’s auspicious prospects anima power (p. XX). 
- He gains the [[Materialize]] Charm (Exalted, p. 510) if he doesn’t already have it. 
- He’s not considered an enemy of fate or a creature of darkness. 
- If he’s destroyed without the use of magic like [[Ghost-Eating Technique]], he reforms at the Sidereal’s side within a day. 
- Upon completing the task, the ghost passes onto Lethe, enjoying Rising Butterfly Prayer’s benefits. If the Sidereal uses necromancy to summon and bind a ghost, she can use this Charm reflexively to confer its benefits upon him for the binding’s duration without assigning a task. The Sidereal can also deputize Liminals and Abyssals, though the only benefit this confers is that they aren’t considered enemies of fate (or creatures of darkness, for Abyssals). This benefit becomes permanent if they fulfill the task, though they may still revert to the status if their actions warrant it. With [[Essence]] 3, the Sidereal can pay two experience points to change this Charm’s duration to Instant. If the deputized ghost is permanently destroyed or completes his assignment, she’s refunded this experience cost.
