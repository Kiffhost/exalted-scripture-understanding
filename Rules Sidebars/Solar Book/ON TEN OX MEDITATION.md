For example, the Solar sees a laden wagon sinking into a sand pit. She has Strength 5, and no time to activate Increasing-Strength Exercise—perhaps someone will die if she does not act instantly. According to the rules on page 229, this feat requires Strength 7, and twelve successes on a (Strength + Athletics) roll. She grabs the hitch, channeling from deep within her reservoirs of might to try to pull it free anyway. The player invokes a full Athletics Excellency, Thunder’s Might and Ten Ox Meditation, rolling eighteen successes. The player spends six of these successes to raise the Solar’s Strength by two—the minimum needed to accomplish the feat. Because the player still has twelve successes left over, and has raised the Solar’s Strength to 7, the Exalt is able to pull the wagon from the sand trap immediately.
