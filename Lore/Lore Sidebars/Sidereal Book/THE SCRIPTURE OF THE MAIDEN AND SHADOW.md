Once, there was a maiden…
...whose shadow fled from her. She chased it over
fire and stone.
She chased her shadow to a monster’s mouth. It
went right in. It didn’t know how to stop.
The maiden caught her shadow in a deep cave
full of ghosts. It turned into a ball of thorns that
wrapped around her. When the ghosts pricked
their fingers on the thorns, they came to life. This
didn’t make anyone very happy.
The maiden made a ladder from the ghosts’
bones, but it only pointed downward. “Why go
on?” her shadow asked.
“I can’t quit now,” said she.
