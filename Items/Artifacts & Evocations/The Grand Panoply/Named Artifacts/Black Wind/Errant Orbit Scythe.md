*The Solar takes Black Wind’s power to hand, and the [[Templates/skycutter]] yields its killing blades to her masterful technique.*
She hurls its blood blades out on independent missions of destruction, making a number of withering attacks equal to the number of blades expended, to a maximum of ([[Essence]] or 5, whichever is lower) attacks. These attacks may be directed at multiple opponents or at a single opponent; each grants [[Initiative]] equal to half the amount of damage inflicted on its target (round up). 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience. It awakens after the first time the Solar accumulates five blood blades at once, after gaining [[Essence]] 3+.
