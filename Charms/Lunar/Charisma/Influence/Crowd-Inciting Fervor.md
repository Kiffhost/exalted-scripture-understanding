The Lunar gives voice to the fury others bury within their hearts, breaking the chains of fear and restraint. She rolls (Charisma + [Performance or Presence]) with (higher of Essence or 3) bonus dice to inspire rage. Each affected character’s player chooses someone or something that his character’s rage is directed against and treats the influence as a successful roll to instill an Intimacy that expresses this rage or to weaken one that opposes it. Resisting this influence requires entering a Decision Point and invoking a Major or Defining Intimacy.
