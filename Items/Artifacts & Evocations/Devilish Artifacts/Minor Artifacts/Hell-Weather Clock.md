These complex devices, roughly the size of a broad-shouldered human adult, are common possessions for Second and Third Circle demons. Some have crystalline panes that reveal the intricate assembly of green iron cogs and brass springs within, while others bear flattering depictions of the demons who commissioned them, but no hell-weather clock has a face. These instruments don't portray the passage of time, but rather sing out warning of the devastating “weather” of Hell: Hegra’s emotion-storms, toxic floods, urban avalanches, rampaging Yozis and behemoths, and the Silent Wind’s approach.

When attuned for one mote, a hell-weather clock’s sounds change in pitch and tempo as hellish weather builds and approaches its location, creating music that a canny listener can interpret. This adds two non-Charm successes on Survival rolls to predict local weather in Hell and on Awareness rolls to notice rapid changes in hell-weather in advance. This can’t predict magic that creates or manipulates hell-weather. The clock’s master can go (Essence) months without contact before her attunement lapses.

Some hell-weather clocks are small enough to fit in a pocket. However, they add only one non-Charm success on rolls. Additionally, their constant noise imposes a −1 Stealth penalty, which can rise up to −3 as hell-weather approaches.
