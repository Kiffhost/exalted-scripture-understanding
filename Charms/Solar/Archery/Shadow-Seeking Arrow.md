During combat, if the Lawgiverâ€™s [[Awareness]] check uncovers an opponent, she may make an attack against that opponent regardless of the [[Initiative]] order, without using her attack action for the round, and without having to use an aim action. The Solar may pay to use this Charm multiple times to attack multiple opponents she has uncovered in a single [[Awareness]] check.
