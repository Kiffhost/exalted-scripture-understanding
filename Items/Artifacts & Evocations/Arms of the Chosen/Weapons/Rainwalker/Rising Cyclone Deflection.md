Whirling with impossible speed, [[Rainwalker]] diverts any attack it blocks. This Evocation defends against a withering attack and must be declared before rolling. If the wielder successfully parries the attack, she may redirect it at another enemy within close range, using the same attack roll and declared [[Charms]]. If she uses this Evocation together with [[Arrows Like Raindrops]], she may redirect ranged attacks against enemies out to short range. The enemy who makes the redirected attack gains no [[Initiative]] from hitting or damaging his ally â€” all gathered [[Initiative]] is lost. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by parrying a decisive attack with 15+ dice on its attack roll. 

## Dissonant

CharactersdissonantwithRainwalkercannot awaken this Evocation. 

## Resonant

The wielder gains half the [[Initiative]] that the character who made the redirected withering attack would have received (round up).
