*The Dragon-Blood sights along every possible line of attack, readying her arrows to strike anywhere and everywhere in defense of her allies.*
Whenever an enemy makes a ranged attack against the Dragon-Blood or one of her allies within her weapon’s range, she may reflexively clash it with a special decisive attack, without needing to aim. Unlike a normal clash, success doesn’t prevent the enemy attack from hitting, nor does it deal decisive damage or reset the Dragon-Blood’s [[Initiative]]. Instead, every threshold success subtracts one success from the enemy’s attack roll against his original target. The attacker still suffers the onslaught penalty of her attack, and if he misses his target, the −2 [[Defense]] penalty for losing a clash. The Dragon-Blood gains three [[Initiative]] if the clash removes all successes from the attack, or one [[Initiative]] if she lowers the attack successes from an amount the original target couldn’t have dodged or parried to one that he can. This doesn’t count as her combat action, and she may clash any number of attacks each round. This Charm ends if the Dragon-Blood attempts to dodge or parry, or if she makes an attack on her own turn (although she may use other [[Charms]] to clash, counterattack, or make reflexive attacks normally). This Charm can only be used once per scene.
