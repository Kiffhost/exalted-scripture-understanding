*The deathknight calls her weapon from afar, beckoning it to her imperiously outstretched hand.*
The Abyssal summons her weapon from within short range to her hand, rolling ([[Wits]] + [[Melee]]) at difficulty 4. If successful, her weapon flashes instantly to her hand without crossing the space between.
On a failed roll, she pulls the weapon towards her, but it does not reach her hand until the beginning of her next turn, and its movement can be stopped by physical obstacles. She can’t use this Charm to steal other character’s weapons.
