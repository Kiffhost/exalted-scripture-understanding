Many of Creation’s beasts are touched by strange magics. Some have fed upon the flora and fauna of demesnes, bordermarches, and other places of power. Others bear divine blessings, or have the blood of gods or demons flowing through their veins. An ancient sorcerer’s familiar might be its master’s final work of magic. A sorcerer with this initiation has formed a mystical bond with such a creature as her familiar, and attained a deeper understanding of the world through it. 

Witch-beasts are always three-dot familiars (Exalted, p. 161) for the supernatural powers they possess. Examples include a Fae-Blooded cat that walks through mirrors, a death-tainted raiton, or an oracular pig. Three-dot familiars that are apex predators, like tyrant lizards, don’t qualify. A character must already have an appropriate familiar to take this initiation.
