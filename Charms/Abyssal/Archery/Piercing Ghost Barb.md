*The Abyssal’s loosed arrow becomes a wailing phantasm, passing through all obstructions to strike true.*
The Abyssal can pay a four-mote, two-Initiative surcharge when she uses Bloodthirsty Arrow to make her projectile intangible until it strikes her foe, rendering the attack unblockable. She ignores light and heavy cover completely and can pierce full cover without needing to aim or have an opening to attack through. The target’s soak and Hardness are halved against the attack, rounded down, except for any granted by magic.
The ghost-arrow’s flight can be impeded by wards against the undead and by living plants. An enemy wielding a just-uprooted sapling could block it, while a wall that’s had a line of salt drawn along one side would prevent the arrow from passing through.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Abyssal’s Initiative and building back up to 15+ Initiative.
