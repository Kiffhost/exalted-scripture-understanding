*The Solar hurls her weapon across the sky to seek her foe like a bird of prey.*
This Charm allows the Exalt to make a withering or decisive attack at medium range without aiming. In addition, if [[Iron Raptor Technique]] is used to crash an opponent, the Exalt gains one point of temporary [[Willpower]]. Usually the weapon returns to the Solar’s hand on the same tick she makes the attack. However, if the attack roll is a botch, the Lawgiver’s weapon becomes embedded in scenery at close range to the defending target.
