This hearthstone is outwardly clear and colorless, with a shifting prismatic radiance held deep within. It perfectly reflects and stores all of its bearer’s memories within its facets, so long as it resides within an attuned hearthstone socket and those memories were made while carrying the stone. The bearer of the Memory Stone may draw pristine recollections from the stone’s depths whenever she chooses, granting her perfect recall. If the stone ever falls from attunement for more than a day, all stored memories within it fade away, and the stone’s former master must once more rely upon her own fallible recollections.
