This unusual, chalky-black jewel offers no benefit when placed into a hearthstone socket. Rather, it is a weapon.
If placed into an open hearthstone socket on an enemy’s equipment (a difficulty 3 [[Martial Arts]] or [[Brawl]]-based gambit in combat), the stone locks into place with an audible ringing crash, and dramatically increases the artifact’s weight. This automatically disarms weapons, sending them smashing to the ground where they cannot be retrieved so long as the hearthstone remains in place.
It makes armor so heavy that movement actions become impossible and all other actions suffer a -3 penalty. Forcibly prying the stone loose requires a difficulty 4 feat of strength that cannot be placed in a flurry.
