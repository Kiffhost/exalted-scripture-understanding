*A [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Generic Artifact Weapons/Direlance]] is a massive spear forged with an alloy of one of the magical materials.*
Its sturdy construction allows it to be used to make mounted charges like a [[Lance]] or be wielded as a long [[Spear]] in melee. If used like a [[Lance]], the [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Generic Artifact Weapons/Direlance]] may be used single-handed during a mounted charge. If used as a [[Spear]], a [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Generic Artifact Weapons/Direlance]] requires two hands to wield.
