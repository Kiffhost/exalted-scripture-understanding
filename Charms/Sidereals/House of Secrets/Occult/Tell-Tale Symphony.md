Patterns of Essence sing to the Sidereal, revealing the subtle harmonies of the cosmos. The Sidereal can sense when a spirit is within earshot by soft ringing of bells that surrounds them, even if they’re dematerialized. This typically extends out to medium range, though environmental conditions and magic may increase or decrease it. She can roll (Perception + Occult) instead of the usual roll to oppose such spirits’ Stealth or read their intentions. A successful read intentions roll also reveals whether they belong to the Celestial Bureaucracy and, if so, learn what position they hold. With Occult 5, Essence 2, the Sidereal can hear the subtler music of sorcery, Evocations, and spirit or fae Charms. While this reveals the presence of such effects and their general nature, it doesn’t reveal what they do or how they work.
