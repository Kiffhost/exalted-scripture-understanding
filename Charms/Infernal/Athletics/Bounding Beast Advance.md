*The Infernal leaps from afar to pounce on her prey.*

The Infernal uses a reflexive move action to jump one range band vertically or horizontally, without needing to roll.

If the Infernal leaps to move into close range with an enemy, this Charm’s cost is reduced by one mote.
### Keys 
#### Sky-Vaulting Surge (Athletics 3) (+3m)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote surcharge to end a horizontal leap in mid-air as she moves in a single great bound. On her next turn, she must use this Charm again to continue her leap or fall to the ground. She can choose to descend one range band in addition to her forward movement.
