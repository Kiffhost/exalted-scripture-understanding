Near the end of Old Man Kai’s first life, his brusque manner incensed a passing Prince of the Earth, who thrashed Kai within an inch of death. Finding no redress in his own land, Kai traveled ten thousand miles to Meru, heart of the Old Realm, to seek justice from the holy Ambrani Rao, high priest of the Sun. But Rao would not see an elderly, pilgrimage-scarred peasant from the provinces. Offended beyond endurance, Kai took the Second Breath. Brushing Rao’s guards aside, he burst into the holy sanctum and berated the Sun’s own priest for pride and lack of compassion. Old Man Kai forged the wrackstaff [[Talion]] as a vessel for his angry, unquenched sense of righteousness. With it he thrashed the Prince of the Earth who had first offended him, then went out into the world to chastise all — gods, demons, princes and thieves — whom he deemed unjust. Today the staff itself is an object of veneration by a Southern cult whose ecclesiasts claim that it reveals to them the iniquity in mortal hearts — though, conveniently, it never disagrees with their judgments. The staff is a plain shaft of orichalcum, its surface cunningly worked to resemble rough wood grain. A thin band of starmetal encircles each end, while squares of starmetal inlaid along the shaft spell out the name “Talion” in Old Realm characters. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Talion]]

Talion’s wielder may devote herself to pursuing a grievance against someone — termed the offender — who has wronged her in a manner defined by one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. For example, she may wish to slay the assassin who murdered her beloved brother, or reduce to penury a merchant prince whose practices affront a key [[Intimacy|Principle]]. Her desire for justice becomes a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] that cannot be altered or diminished while the Exalt remains attuned, or until end of story after her attunement ends. If she rolls [[Limit]] for violating this [[Intimacy]] (Exalted, p. 134), she doubles 9s. While pursuing that grievance, she adds two non-Charm dice to track the offender; to mitigate [[environmental hazards]] that obstruct pursuit of her grievance; and on feats of strength and demolition against obstructions to pursuing her grievance, treating her [[Strength]] as two higher for purposes of meeting [[Strength]] minimums. When the wielder satisfactorily concludes pursuit of a grievance — e.g., via punishment, compensation, or penitence — she sheds the associated [[Intimacy|Principle]] and gains one temporary [[Willpower]] per session the pursuit lasted. The first time each story she successfully concludes a grievance, she sheds one point of [[Limit]]. The wielder may only pursue one grievance at a time. Once she concludes her pursuit successfully or it becomes impossible to pursue, she may choose a new grievance, though no more often than once per session. She can abandon an existing grievance when a new story begins.
