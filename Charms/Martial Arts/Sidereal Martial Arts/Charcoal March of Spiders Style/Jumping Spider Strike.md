*The martial artist bounds forward to strike a distant foe with impossible speed and force, as if the all the tension of fate’s tapestry was released through her.*
The stylist makes an unblockable decisive attack against any enemy she can perceive regardless of distance, even out to extreme range, leaping to whatever range she wishes to attack from in a single monstrous bound. She must have an unobstructed path along which to leap. She strikes with terrible force, adding two dice of damage per range band crossed, maximum ten dice. An enemy incapacitated by this attack is reduced to nothing but blood and dust. If the stylist uses this Charm from concealment or from extreme range, her target rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) opposing her attack roll. If he fails, her attack is an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). The stylist can use this Charm outside of combat, prompting a [[Join Battle]] roll for all involved parties. She can also use it against inanimate objects and structures, in which case she treats the attack as a feat of demolition with effective [[Strength]] 10, rolling ([[Strength]] + [[Martial Arts]]) with ([[Essence]] + range bands) non-Charm successes.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used once per scene unless reset by successfully defending against an attack from long or extreme range by a nontrivial enemy. 
## Enlightenment
The stylist may use this Charm to mediate on a character for whom she holds a negative Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]], committing its mote cost indefinitely while she meditates. If that character comes within ([[Essence]]) range bands of her, she automatically and reflexively attacks him as above, without needing to perceive him. This is an ambush (Exalted, p. 203) unless the enemy was already aware of the Sidereal’s location.
