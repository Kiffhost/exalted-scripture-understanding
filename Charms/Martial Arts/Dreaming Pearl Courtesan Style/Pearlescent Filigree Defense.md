*An iridescent sheen comes over the martial artist’s garments as Essence enfolds them, turning silk as strong as steel.*
Any clothing the martial artist wears while this Charm is active is treated as mortal light armor. This is explicitly compatible with this style, but not with any other styles that forbid armor. In addition, whenever the martial artist is hit by an attack, she may spend up to her (Appearance) in motes, adding one point to her armored soak against that attack for each mote spent this way. 
## Mastery
The first time the martial artist uses this Charm to defend against a decisive attack in a fight, she reveals the supernal resilience of her seemingly vulnerable figure, gaining hardness 10 against the attack as well as a surge of three motes that can be spent to add to the armor’s soak, or on similar effects, such as many Solar Resistance Charms. These motes vanish at the end of the scene if not spent.
