*Coughing and clattering, [[Rattlebones]] unleashes dozens of razor-sharp bone darts capped.*
The wielder makes an undodgeable decisive attack against all characters, including allies, in a ninetydegree arc out to short range. Against hit enemies, the attack’s base damage depends on their range from the wielder: three dice at close or two dice at short. The wielder divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among them, rounded up, to determine the total damage. Battle groups instead suffer (wielder’s [[Initiative]] + 3) damage dice.
While using [[Osseous Arbalest Graft]], this Evocation’s range extends to medium. The attack’s base damage against enemies at medium range is one die.
## Resonant
If the wielder benefits from aiming, she may waive its usual benefits to exclude allies from this barrage.
## Dissonant
This Evocation can only be used once per scene unless reset by crashing an opponent at close range.
