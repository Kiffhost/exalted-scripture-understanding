*Bending her knees low to sink into a stance that minimizes her profile, the vizier recedes from the front lines to guide her shadow fingers in battle.*
The stylist gains the following benefits
- When she’s attacked, the stylist may treat a shadow finger within close range as protecting her with a defend other action.
- When she makes a distract gambit to benefit a shadow finger, she grants an additional (Essence, maximum 5) Initiative. She may choose to divide the gambit’s Initiative among multiple shadow fingers.
- She reduces the −3 penalty for Stealth in combat by the number of shadow fingers within short range.
- She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on rolls to introduce facts and may do so reflexively.
## Special activation rules
When one of the stylist’s shadow fingers wins Join Battle, she may reflexively enter this Form.
