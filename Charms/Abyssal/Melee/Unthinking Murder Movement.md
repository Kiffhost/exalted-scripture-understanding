*The deathknight’s killing arts cut down foes with effortless grace, bloodying her blade without a hint of exertion.*
The Abyssal makes a decisive attack, which is unblockable and undodgeable unless her opponent enhances his [[Defense]] with magic. It deals ([[Essence]] + attack roll extra successes) dice of damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t include her [[Initiative]] or reset her to base.
If the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]] equals or exceeds this attack’s base damage, she waives the [[Willpower]] cost to use [[Artful Maiming Onslaught]] on the attack.
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by dealing 3+ damage to a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack that resets the Abyssal to base [[Initiative]], then reaching 12+ [[Initiative]].
