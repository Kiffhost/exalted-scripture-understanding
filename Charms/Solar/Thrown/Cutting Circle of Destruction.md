The Exalt hurls her weapon along a course designed to do the utmost harm. It screams through the air, careening from target to target, gathering momentum and Essence until it strikes a final, furious blow. For this attack, the player must designate a final target to be the recipient of a decisive attack, and up to (Dexterity) other targets her weapon will strike before reaching its final destination. For each of these other targets, Cutting Circle of Destruction creates a withering attack, and as long as each withering attack generates more damage than the last, her weapon continues on to the next target, until it launches itself against the final target with the gathered Initiative for a final decisive attack. If at any point her next withering attack fails to gain more Initiative than the last, Cutting Circle of Destruction aborts immediately to the last target in the string and the player rolls out a decisive attack against the designated final target. 

## Special activation rules

Each withering attack in this string can be enhanced by supplemental Charms as if those Charms were reflexive, allowing the player to control how many motes they wish to spend on any attack in this string. War
