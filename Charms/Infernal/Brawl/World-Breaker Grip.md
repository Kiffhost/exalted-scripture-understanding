*The Infernal grasps her prey like a beast’s chew toy, dragging it around thoughtlessly.*

The Infernal makes a grapple gambit. If she succeeds, she gains the following benefits for the duration of the clinch:
- She suffers none of the usual penalties for grappling.
- Dragging her enemy only costs one round of control.
- She can use her grapple action for her turn to make a withering or decisive attack using the grappled enemy as an improvised weapon. Human-sized foes typically count as medium weapons. If she deals 5+ withering damage or any decisive damage, the grappled enemy suffers one die of bashing damage, which ignores Hardness.
- The Infernal can likewise use the grappled enemy to as an improvised weapon to parry. If she uses him to successfully block a decisive attack, he suffers one die of damage of that attack’s type, ignoring Hardness.
- If the Infernal ends the clinch by using [[Unwitting Victim Bludgeon]], she waives that Charm’s Willpower cost.
