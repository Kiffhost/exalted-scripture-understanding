*In a flash of insight, the student becomes the master.*
As per [[Flowing Mind Prana]], when the Solar rolls to regain experience points at the end of the story, she may pay one experience point to activate this Charm, reflecting on her student’s progress. This allows her to reroll all non-successes on the roll to regain experience a single time. This Charm explicitly allows the Solar to gain back more experience points than she invested in training. If this occurs, “overage” experience does not count toward progress to raise the character’s [[Essence]].
