*On the occasions that she can be moved to largesse, the deathknight demands repayment with interest.*
The Abyssal makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Bureaucracy]]) bargain roll with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes against a single character to demand repayment of a debt to her or an organization she belongs to. If the Abyssal succeeds, the weight of the debt is magnified in her victim’s mind, driving him to repay it as soon as possible — even if he doesn’t actually owe it.
For debts that must be paid in money or goods, he’ll provide an amount representing a [[Resources]] expenditure that’s one dot higher than what he owes (Exalted, p. 578). If he must perform a service to repay the debt, this counts as a persuade roll to convince him to do so, reducing the level of [[Intimacy]] needed to support the Abyssal’s demand by one (Exalted, p. 216). The Abyssal can demand repayment for debts that aren’t actually owed, but no more than a one-dot Resource expenditure or an inconvenient task. If he dies before repaying the debt, he lingers as a ghost, still bound by this Charm’s influence.
Resisting this influence costs (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) [[Willpower]]. Doing so renders a character immune to this Charm for one week.
This Charm is more effective against characters whose permanent [[Willpower]] is equal or less than (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]). She doesn’t need to roll against them and they can’t resist with [[Willpower]]. Such characters will give whatever she asks to repay the debt, even pledging to serve the Abyssal for the rest of their lives — and beyond. Whether or not the debt actually exists is irrelevant.
