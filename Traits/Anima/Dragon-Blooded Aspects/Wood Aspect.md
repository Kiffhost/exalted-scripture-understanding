Wood is the life of Creation, that which changes in the bloom of birth or the rot of death. It lives, grows, and dies to make way for new growth, the only element that undergoes the cycle of life and death. Wood is life-sustaining, nourishing man and beast with fruits and grain. Wood is life-ending, its thorns dripping with deadly poison. The five elements are intricately interwoven, and wood is that which unites them. It lays its roots in the earth and draws nourishment from water, air, and the light of the fiery sun, bringing them together as it reaches full bloom. 

To Exalt as a [[Wood Aspect]] is to blossom with sensuality, developing a newfound appreciation for each and every experience. This need not be hedonistic or lascivious (though it certainly can be). There’s as much satisfaction to be had in the profound epiphany of spiritual enlightenment or the exhilaration of feeling a hated foe’s blood splatter against one’s face as there is in banquets, wine, or sex. Every experience and sensation is an opportunity for growth and self-discovery, if only one will take the time to properly notice it.

The Children of Sextes Jylis pursue this sensuality through every part of life. Every battle teaches harsh truths about one’s strengths and weaknesses, whether it ends in defeat or triumph over arrow-strewn corpses. Every love affair teaches new lessons about the heart. Every performance offers a deeper understanding of the rhythms and melodies of a song. Wood Aspects have a strong affinity for the cycle of life and death, as both master healers and master poisoners. They have an almost instinctive understanding of animals and plants, taming deadly beasts to ride into battle or navigating bramble-choked wilderness with effortless vigor. 

A [[Wood Aspect]] tends to her Sworn Kinship as though it were a garden, nurturing her Hearthmates’ growth as warriors and heroes while pruning back their weaknesses and flaws. Each of her Sworn Kin is an irreplaceable part of a greater whole, and the bonds between them must be nourished so that they might together reach their fullest potential. Wood Aspects likewise devote themselves to the growth of their Dragon-Blooded cultures, nurturing the people and places with the potential to benefit the whole while weeding out those things that have no place in their perfect society.

# Aspect Markings

Wood Aspects tend toward a greenish tinge to their skin, hair, lips, or even blood, and often have green eyes. They may smell of flowers, pine, fresh fruit, or other plants. Some have leaves or flowers growing in their hair, or even grow a light layer of bark on their skin, typically along the back and shoulders. 

# Anima Banner

[[Wood Aspect]] anima banners burst with bright green light, waving like meadow grasses, spreading like tree branches, or blossoming like flower petals. Some are wild and untamed, while some seem dappled like a forest in sunlight. They may be accompanied by sound like a strong wind moaning through dense forests, or the scents of living foliage. Their iconic animas frequently depict wood dragons, writhing tangles of thorns, massive trees, giant flowers, vines of ivy rising skyward, or forest animals such as wolves, bears, or foxes.

# Anima Effects

Wood Aspects need not fear poison, even as their venomous anima flux weakens their foes. They can also embody the lithe grace of plants (p. 155). 
- For five motes, the [[Wood Aspect]] becomes immune to mundane plant-based poisons, and doubles 9s on rolls to resist other poisons and diseases for the scene. She gains these benefits for free while at bonfire.
- For three motes, the [[Wood Aspect]] becomes flexible as a sapling in the wind, ignoring one point of penalty to Evasion or ([[Essence]]) points of penalty on a movement action for an instant.
- A Wood Aspect’s anima flux is laced with toxic power. A character that takes damage from it is exposed to a poison with Damage 2i/round, Duration ([[Essence]] + [[Stamina]]) rounds, and a −1 penalty.

# Great Curse Manifestation

A Wood Aspect’s Great Curse might intensify her sensuality into hedonistic excess, dangerous thrill-seeking, or wild binges that leave her overcome by guilt, regret, or the desire to atone. She may instead become overzealous in her attempts to nurture the people and societies around her, becoming overbearingly controlling of that which she protects or mercilessly pruning away undesirable elements.
