The words of the Lawgiver turn the wheels of the world. When the Solar advises another character on social etiquette or group or cultural policy, roll ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Socialize) dice and add her successes as bonus dice that the target may use to enhance a Socialize roll, or to increase his Guile or Resolve for a single tick at a rate of two successes per point. The target of this assistance may spread this bonus out over the course of several scenes and multiple actions, or he may choose to use all of the dice at once. If the target applies any part of this bonus to an action, any positive Intimacy he has for the Lawgiver is increased in intensity and if one does not exist he gains one automatically.
