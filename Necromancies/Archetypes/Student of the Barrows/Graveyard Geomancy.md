Once per scene, the necromancer gains three necromantic motes when she begins to shape necromancy in a place of death such as a graveyard, battlefield, or other site of mass death. Every [[Shape Necromancy]] action taken while in such a place grants an additional necromantic mote. She may always gain this benefit in a [[shadowland]] at night, or while in the [[Underworld]]. When attuned and standing within an Abyssal demesne or manse, she may gain its rating in necromantic motes instead of three.
