*Before a brazier of grave ash, the necromancer meditates to send her soul to haunt another or make pronouncements through the dying.*
The necromancer casts a scrap of clothing, lock of hair, or similar symbolic link to another character into the brazier’s flames, rolling ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) against his [[Resolve]]. If successful, she may scry on the target, observing him remotely, as a shade hovering behind him. She can be perceived by characters capable of seeing dematerialized spirits. While using this spell, she can’t sense anything through her own body or take actions with it, unless she chooses to end it prematurely. Taking damage automatically ends this spell.
The necromancer may choose to possess either the target, or any trivial mortal or ghost within close range of him. While doing so, she may perceive through her chosen host’s senses and speak through his mouth, her voice emerging with an unearthly tenor. She may socially [[Social Influence|influence]] those able to hear her speaker as normal but possesses no other control over her speaker’s body.
Communicating through the chosen speaker causes injury and distress: The speaker’s eyes burn with black power and weep bloody tears; his skin grows pale and jaundiced; he begins to shudder with chills and even sweat blood. A ghost’s corpus begins to fray, melting and flowing like cooked fat before boiling away. After an hour of communication or at the scene’s end, the speaker suffers either five levels of lethal damage or gains a mundane disease of the Storyteller’s choice at Major intensity. Exalted targets instead suffer one level of lethal damage. Though still incredibly painful, the effect may be averted if the necromancer communicates for less than a minute.
Targets may force the caster out by entering a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and citing a Defining [[Intimacy]] to spend three [[Willpower]]. This renders them immune to further uses of this spell by that necromancer for (their [[Essence]]) years.
## Control
If the necromancer has met the target previously and he is near death, she may cast this spell on him without requiring a sympathetic link. Valid targets include a character with a disease at Major or Defining Intensity, with his Incapacitated health level filled, in the final years of his life, or similar.
Should she speak through him, he will pass away at the scene’s end unless he resists with [[Willpower]].
Once per story, she may use this spell on ghost she is aware of without a sympathetic link.
## Distortion (10)
To distort this spell, the necromancer must be within short range of the target or a possessed speaker. If distorted, the necromancer can’t use [[Charms]] to enhance her senses or social influence while this spell is in effect, and her chosen speaker only suffers a single die of lethal damage at the scene’s end.
