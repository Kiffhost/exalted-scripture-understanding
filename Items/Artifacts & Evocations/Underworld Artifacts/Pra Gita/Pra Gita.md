Once, there was a fisherwoman whose love was the stuff of legend. When her beloved husband fell deathly ill, that she traveled the lands of the living and dead, beseeching spirits both sacred and profane.
Yet no matter how sincere her pleas, they went unanswered by god and demon alike. At last, she came to a palace of crimson ice and fell to her knees before the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears. The witchqueen agreed, but demanded that the fisherwoman first cut off her hands as proof of her love. Without hesitation, the woman drew her blade. Five days later, her beloved had been healed.
Yet what surprise could there be? In time, her beloved proved faithless, for his love was a meager thing compared to what she felt for him. Broken-hearted, she came again before the Lover, begging for revenge. The ghost-queen smiled upon the woman and returned her hands, now forged into talons of merciless soulsteel. With them, she slew her beloved and a hundred others, a sainted terror in the Lover’s service. When at last she died, she passed into oblivion, content with her vengeance.
[[Pra Gita]] was recovered by Iopesh of Quay, warrior-king who sought them out to reclaim his throne from the faithless son who’d overthrown him. The necromancer Jurul Mokasha turned them against her brother after his debauchery and dereliction stained their family’s name. [[Time]] after time, those who wield them have learned that the wages of love are betrayal. The Lover smiles with each new wielder who claims them, for her great lesson spreads from the tip of each razored talon.
These claws appear as a pair of hollowed, leathery hands with razor-sharp fingernails of delicate soulsteel filigree. A hearthstone socket gapes like an open wound in each palm. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Pra Gita]]

[[Pra Gita]] punishes the unfaithful — those who are unloyal in love, friendship, loyalty, or the like. The wielder must be aware of this disloyalty to gain this artifact’s benefits against the unfaithful.
Pra Gita’s wielder awakens [[Dread Accuser’s Talon]] at no cost upon attunement.
