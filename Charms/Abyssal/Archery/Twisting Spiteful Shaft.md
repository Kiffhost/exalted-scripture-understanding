*The deathknight’s arrow burrows through her victim’s flesh, boring deeper and deeper toward his heart.*
The Abyssal adds one die of damage to a decisive attack.
If it deals 3+ damage, her arrow begins burrowing into her victim. His wound penalty is increased by −1, and he suffers (Abyssal’s Essence) dice of lethal damage at the start of each of his turns for the rest of the scene, ignoring Hardness.
Removing the arrow requires a (Wits + Medicine) roll at difficulty (higher of Abyssal’s Strength or 3) as a miscellaneous action.
