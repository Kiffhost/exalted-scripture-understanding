Some Dragon-Blooded Charms have multiple elemental aspects. Some have different effects for their multiple aspects and require the Dragon-Blood to choose one; these Charms will be keyworded as, e.g. Air OR Earth. Others belong to two or more elements simultaneously, and are keyworded as, e.g., Air/Earth. For purposes of the Dragon-Blood’s Elemental Aura, the latter Charms count as whichever element is most advantageous to her — she could enter Water Aura using a Charm that is both Air and Water, and using a Charm that is both Fire and Wood would not disrupt her Fire Aura.
