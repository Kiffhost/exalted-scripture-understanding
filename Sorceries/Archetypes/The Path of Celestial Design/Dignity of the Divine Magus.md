Once per scene, when the sorcerer succeeds on an influence role to assert the authority of a bureaucratic position she holds or a god on whose behalf she’s acting, she gains ([[Bureaucracy]]) sorcerous motes. She can also gain this benefit when she’s insulted, cheated, slandered, or otherwise treated rudely or unfairly. If she spends these sorcerous motes on a harmful spell that targets someone who’s slighted her, she adds ([[Bureaucracy]]) dice on any rolls involved.
