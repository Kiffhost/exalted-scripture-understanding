*The Abyssal’s words eat away at organizations like acid, sowing discord with rumors and lies.*
The Abyssal rolls ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Bureaucracy]]) to sabotage a project or other bureaucratic task she’s aware of, as her player retroactively describes a whisper campaign or similar effort she’s previously mounted against the project’s leader. That character opposes the deathknight’s roll with whatever (Attribute + Ability) pool is most appropriate to the targeted project.
If the Abyssal succeeds, the sabotaged project will suffer at least ([[Essence]]) botches over its duration.
Each extra success she rolls adds an additional ([[Essence]]) botches. Such botches typically result in breakdowns of communication within the organization, failing morale among project members, and strained relationships between the project’s leader and others within the organization, if they aren’t already the case.
## Reset 
This Charm can’t be used on an organization more than once per story.
