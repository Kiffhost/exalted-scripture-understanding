The Lunar’s anima banner erupts into a pillar of all-conquering force as she embodies the divine might of a legendary god-beast. When performing a feat of strength that benefits from a full Excellency, she uses the highest Strength rating of any animal form whose heart’s blood she possesses to determine if she can attempt it. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes capable of Strength 10+ feats, the Lunar can attempt a feat of strength no matter how high its Strength minimum is.
