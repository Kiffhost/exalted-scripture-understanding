*To look upon Death’s Lawgiver is to witness the inevitable end of all things.*
The Abyssal makes a ([[Appearance]] + [[Presence]]) [[instill]] roll against any number of characters who can perceive her to [[instill]] a [[Intimacy|Principle]] related to death or a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of awe, fear, or obedience towards the Abyssal.
She converts dice added by her [[Appearance]] to non-Charm successes. This costs two [[Willpower]] to resist; doing so renders a character immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene.
For this Charm’s duration, instilled [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] count as one step stronger to determine what tasks they’ll support for the Abyssal’s [[persuade]] rolls (Exalted, p. 216), and increase the cost to resist [[persuade]] rolls that leverage them by one [[Willpower]].
