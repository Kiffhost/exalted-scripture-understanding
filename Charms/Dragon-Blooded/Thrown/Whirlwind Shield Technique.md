*Whirling currents of wind swirl around the Exalt, catching her weapons as she tosses them into the air to create a vortex of deadly steel and whatever rocks, branches, or other detritus are caught up in the wind.* 
She rolls the whirlwind into battle with (Wits + Thrown). It has a Parry rating equal to half the total successes, rounded up, on its [[Join Battle]]  roll (maximum5), and its only action is to protect the Exalt with defend other (Exalted, p. 196), moving to accompany her wherever she goes. 
It gains one [[Initiative]] whenever it successfully defends against an attack. The whirlwind shield has soak ([[Essence]] + [[Dexterity]] + [[Stamina]]). Withering attacks against the whirlwind shield reduce its [[Initiative]] normally, while decisive attacks strip two points of [[Initiative]] for each level of damage, although this isnâ€™t awarded to the attacker. If the whirlwind is crashed, this Charm ends. 
This Charm can only be used once per scene.
