The Lunar distills venoms that intermingle the deadliest aspects of countless beasts. For two [[Initiative]], the duration of a poison conveyed by [[Adder Fang Method]] or [[Poison Blood Technique]] increases by one round, plus an additional round for every 10 on the attack and damage rolls. If it would deal bashing or lethal damage, it deals aggravated damage instead. With a [[Stamina]] 4, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, each 10 on the attack and damage rolls lets the Lunar either increase the poison’s duration by round, increase its damage by one (maximum 5), or increase its penalty by one point (maximum 5). She may divide her 10s among these different benefits. Additionally, no matter how many successes her victim rolls, the poison’s duration can’t be reduced below one. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is venomous or poisonous may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm.
