*Drawing strength from the Dragon-Blood’s ministrations, her patient can fight through the worst of his illness.*
When the Terrestrial successfully grants her patient a specialty with [[Disease-Banishing Technique]], she may commit that Charm’s mote cost. When that disease would inflict an automatic botch on one of his rolls (Exalted, p. 234), it instead only inflicts a penalty equal to (6 − {higher of her patient’s [[Stamina]] or Resistance}). The Exalt may mitigate up to ([[Essence]]) botches this way.
