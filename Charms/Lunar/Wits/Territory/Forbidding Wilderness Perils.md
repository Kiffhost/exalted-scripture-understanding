Bristling with traps and curses, the Lunar’s lair is a place of dread for her foes. She spends a day working in a territory claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation, granting it one of the following effects: Hazardous: The Lunar removes natural barriers to the wild’s perils, or bargains with nature spirits to assail her foes. Enemies traversing the territory suffer a difficulty (Lunar’s Essence), Damage 1B/hour environmental hazard: extremes of temperature, foul weather, rockslides, etc. Enemies can avoid the hazard by finding a shelter with a Survival roll and remaining within it. 

Inhospitable: The Lunar destroys natural resources, convinces spirits to withhold their bounty from outsiders, and otherwise denies foes any respite. Enemies suffer a penalty of (Lunar’s Essence) successes on rolls to forage or find shelter. Botches result in them encountering a significant natural danger, like a bear inhabiting the cave they’d hoped to rest in. 

Terrifying: Strewing grotesque displays throughout her territory, carving unsettling glyphs, or pacting with spirits of night and shadow, the Lunar imbues her lair with supernatural menace. Enemies within it are treated as having a Minor Tie of fear toward the land. Enemy battle groups suffer a −1 penalty on rout checks within it, and Strategic Maneuver rolls to deploy enemy troops within it cost a point of Willpower. The Lunar and her allies add two non-Charm successes on rolls to enact the Demoralized stratagem (Exalted, p. 212). The Lunar may stack this Charm to grant a territory multiple effects. Subsequent activations cost only five motes, though if the Lunar ends the original activation, she must immediately commit the full cost for another. A Wits 5, Essence 4 repurchase lets the Lunar grant a new effect: 

Diseased: The Lunar creates pools of standing water that breed disease-carrying mosquitoes, spreads rabies among wildlife, or bargains with disease gods. Enemies within her territory must contend with her choice of cholera, plague, or rabies (Exalted, p. 235). The frequency at which they must roll depends on the disease: daily for rabies, or weekly for cholera or plague. Characters can avoid the roll by recognizing the signs of the disease (for example, diagnosing a traveling companion who’s contracted it), introducing a fact about how it’s spread, and then taking appropriate measures, such as avoiding drinking from cholera-ridden water sources. With Essence 5, the Lunar can inflict hemorrhagic fever, which must be rolled against monthly.
