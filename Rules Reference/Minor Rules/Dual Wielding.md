Characters can wield one weapon in each hand as long as both weapons lack the two-handed tag. Even with a weapon in each hand, characters can still only make a single attack on each turn. However, if the character is wielding a different weapon in each hand, she is free to choose between the weapons and their associated tags each time she attacks or parries, and may stunt her attacks and defenses however she wants, as with a Crane stylist defending with her hook sword’s Parry value while describing her blocks as performed with her war fan.
Characters who dual-wield two identical weapons gain a +2 bonus to Clash attacks. “Unarmed” is considered a single weapon.
