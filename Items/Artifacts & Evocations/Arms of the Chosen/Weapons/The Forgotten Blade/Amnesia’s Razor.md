The Forgotten Blade’s memory-destroying power attains its zenith. This Evocation can only be activated at Initiative 15+ or upon successfully activating Amnestic Desolation. For the rest of the scene, the Exalt adds (Essence) bonus dice to her attack rolls, and opponents struck by the blade are affected as follows: 
- Hitting an opponent generates an automatically successful memory-excising gambit. 
- Incapacitating an opponent gives the wielder the option to use Amnestic Desolation for free against him without needing to roll a gambit instead of killing that opponent. 
- She may use To Fall Unmourned for free whenever she kills an opponent. The Exalt can strike a single inanimate object, structure, or location in order to sever the world’s memory of it, rendering it unrecognizable and unmemorable as per To Fall Unmourned. Doing so ends this Evocation. Those who enter an affected structure or area can recognize and remember it normally while inside. This power fails against colossal natural features such as mountains and seas, or against truly potent magical objects such as N/A artifacts and manses, though the Storyteller is encouraged to allow narratively appealing player ideas to stretch these limits. Amnesia’s Razor can only be used once per story. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
