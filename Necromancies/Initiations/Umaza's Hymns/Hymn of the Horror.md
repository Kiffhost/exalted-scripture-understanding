*Once per scene, when the necromancer sings to [[Inspire]] feelings of fear, [[Instill]] fear- based ties, or [[Threaten]] a character, she rolls ([[Performance]]) with (target’s unmodified [[Resolve]]) bonus dice, gaining one necromantic mote for each success.*
These last until spent; later uses of this replace these motes, rather than stacking.
