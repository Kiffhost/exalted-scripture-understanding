Enacting a fluid battle strategy, the Dragon-Blood and her crew descend on enemy ships with unstoppable force. This Charm enhances any boarding action in naval combat (Exalted, p. 245) with double 9s. If the Dragon-Blood successfully boards and initiates combat, every threshold success on her naval stratagem roll adds one bonus die to the Join Battle rolls of her and all her allies, and she may waive the Willpower cost of Bellowing Thunder Admiral if she wins Join Battle.
