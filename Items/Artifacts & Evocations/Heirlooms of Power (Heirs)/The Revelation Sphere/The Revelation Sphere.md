Amilar Mia awoke in the frozen North, a sphere of dreams clutched in her fist. She knew not how she’d found it, had no memory of her journeys over the last months, but she could feel the power slumbering within the fist-sized orb of rune-etched jade, banded with orichalcum rings. Though seemingly solid, an attuned wielder can twist and manipulate segments of the sphere like a puzzle-box, manipulating it into various configurations of uncertain purpose.
It’s since been passed down through the generations, along with the study of its ancient origins, whether researched in the ruins of Shogunate archives or translated from archaic runes that occasionally drift to the puzzle-sphere’s surface.
Amilar Borulan speaks of how the Widow Daimyo, in her folly, created it to seek out the tombs of the Anathema and despoil their treasure-laden graves; his great-niece Veja calls him a fool, and insists the ancient Dragon-Blooded hero Ophalon ra-Vamaja plucked it from the eye socket of a titanic sorcerer-behemoth.
Whatever the Revelation Sphere’s true origins, it’s a powerful relic in the hands of those seeking after the truth, lending supernal percipience and a clarity as cold as the land in which it was found. Sorcerers can tap its potential to fuel scrying and divinations. Amilar Nefa made her fortune locating jade mines with its power; Amilar Kopal cast open a window in time to find the lost panoply of the Scarecrow Prince, scattered across the Scavenger Lands. Those who’ve truly bonded with the sphere begin to dream of icy labyrinths, feeling a subtle call toward the North and the ends of the earth beyond it. Loyalty to the Seventh Legion and the watchful eyes of their kin have thus far ensured no Amilar has deserted Lookshy in search of this maze, but perhaps someday… Backer: AG 
 
## Evocations of the Revelation Sphere

The Revelation Sphere is exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for rolls to navigate to a manse, demesne, or similar place of power; rolls to track a character bearing an artifact, hearthstone, or similar magical object the wielder knows of; and Investigation rolls to find hidden artifacts, concealed entrances to manses or similar places of power, and the like. If an enhanced roll upholds a Major or Defining Principle, the wielder doubles 9s.
The Revelation Sphere is a sorcerous relic, using the Talisman of Ten Thousand Eyes’ shaping rituals (Exalted, p. 470). Characters who take Terrestrial Circle Sorcery at character may choose it as a sorcerous initiation, gaining the artifact without needing to spend Merit dots.
