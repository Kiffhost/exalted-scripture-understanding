The Solar channels her fiery Essence into an arrow that explodes on impact. This is a non-standard decisive attack that targets no particular character directly, but the range band they’re standing in. The shot lands without a roll, and everything at close range to the arrow is subject to an explosion that can’t be parried, only dodged. The explosion has an attack pool of the Solar’s Initiative (maximum 10 dice), and rolls decisive damage equal to the Solar’s Initiative. If this attack is successful against at least one enemy, then it resets the Solar’s Initiative to base. It can expressly be used to blow up inanimate objects, scenery, and siege weaponry without affecting the Solar’s Initiative. All characters struck by this attack are knocked out of the exploded range band and land prone, losing one Initiative each, not transferred to the Solar. Characters blown down by this Charm have no control over where they land; characters who dodge this explosion are automatically knocked to the next range band, but they do not lose Initiative nor do they fall to prone, simply rolling to their feet or skidding along on their heels without losing balance. If used to damage a battle group, Nova Arrow Attack causes disarray and panic, applying a -2 success penalty to its next attack.

### On Nova Arrow Attack

The natural evolution of Fiery Arrow Attack, I wanted to do this Charm originally, but was too pressed for time to come up with a balanced explosion mechanic. Fortunately as I was rounding out the Archery section of this book one came to me, partly inspired by one of the new Brawl Charm mechanics below. (Guess which.)
