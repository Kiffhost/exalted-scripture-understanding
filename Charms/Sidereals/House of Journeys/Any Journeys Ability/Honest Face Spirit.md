The Sidereal is easily trusted, distinguished by fate from her shiftless and unreliable fellows. The Sidereal gains +2 [[Guile]]. Anyone seeking someone to perform a task or responsibility is inclined to see her as qualified, which counts as a Minor Tie. Rolls to uncover a lack of qualifications suffer +1 target number. An Any Journeys Ability 5, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase extends this Charmâ€™s duration to Indefinite.
