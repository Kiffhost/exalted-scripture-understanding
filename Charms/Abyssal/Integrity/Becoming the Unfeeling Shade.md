*Afflicted with unwanted feelings, the Abyssal feeds them to the yawning void where her heart should be.*
When the Abyssal is targeted by [[social influence]] that leverages one of her positive Intimacies, she discards that [[Intimacy]], losing it completely. If that [[Intimacy]] provided the support necessary for an instill or persuade roll, the roll fails automatically, unless she has another [[Intimacy]] that can support the action.
The Abyssal canâ€™t voluntarily reform the discarded [[Intimacy]] for the rest of the story. If someone tries to instill her with that [[Intimacy]], the roll follows the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221).
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal can invoke her [[Whispers]] to discard any [[Intimacy]] when she uses this Charm, consigning it to the nightmares of the Neverborn.
