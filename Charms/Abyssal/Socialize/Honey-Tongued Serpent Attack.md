*The deathknight’s dark grace makes even the most untoward remarks seem like charming eccentricities, daring jests, or, at worst, necessary evils.*
When the Abyssal makes an instill, persuade, or bargain roll, those who hear her can’t take offense at her remarks or respond with hostility. They can’t form or strengthen negative Ties to her because of it, nor can they weaken positive Ties towards the Abyssal as a result. This costs one Willpower to resist, separate from the deathknight’s influence roll.
