*The Abyssal arcs through the air with the fatal force of a reaping scythe to cull the ranks of the living.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she jumps into close range with an enemy and make a non-ranged attack against him on the same turn. She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) to the raw damage and Overwhelming of a withering attack, or that many dice of decisive damage.
If the Abyssal uses [[Earth-Forsaking Attitude]] to avoid falling damage after this attack, she reduces its total cost by two motes.
