*The Infernal moves like a demonic wind. She is untouched by all opposition and adversity, even as the sky blackens with arrows meant for her.*

The Infernal ignores penalties to Evasion from external sources: onslaught penalties, environmental penalties, and the like. It won’t assist with “internal” conditions, like wound penalties, poison penalties, or crippling penalties. It also doesn’t negate penalties from surprise attacks.

If the Infernal successfully dodges an attack, she adds one die on the next attack roll, rush, or disengage she makes against her attacker. Bonuses from multiple uses of this Charm stack. She loses this benefit if she doesn’t use it by the end of her next turn.

While using [[Opened Eye of the Hurricane]] (p. XX), the Infernal also gains +1 Evasion.
## Keys
