*An expert in countless weapons, the Dragon-Blood’s [[Essence]] is inextricable from her arsenal.*
As long as she has one full-cost attunement to an artifact weapon, she reduces the attunement cost of further artifact weapons (regardless of the Ability used to wield them) by three motes each, to a minimum of one mote. This doesn’t stack with other discounts. If the Dragon-Blood ends her full-cost attunement, she must commit enough motes to bring another attunement to its full cost, or all discounted attunements end.
