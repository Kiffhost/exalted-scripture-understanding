*The Lunar may walk undetected through a kennel of watchdogs or lounge safely on a behemothâ€™s tongue.*
She becomes completely undetectable by smell and taste. Rolls to detect her using only those senses automatically fail, while attempts to track her gain no benefit from superhuman or magically enhanced scenting.
