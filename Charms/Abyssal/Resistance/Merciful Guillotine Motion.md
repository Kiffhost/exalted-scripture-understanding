*The Abyssal’s grasping chains twist and wind together to form a wicked guillotine-blade, falling in thunderbolt-quick descent to grant the absolution of a quick death.*
The Abyssal makes a decisive savaging attack with ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) against an enemy grappled with [[Chain-and-Armor Mortification]]. She adds her attack roll extra successes as damage dice, and also adds two damage dice for each round of grapple control she has. . If this incapacitates her enemy, her [[Initiative]] doesn’t reset.
While using [[Iron Labyrinth of Suffering]], the Abyssal can bring the blade down on multiple grappled foes, as long as they’re all within close range of each other. She makes a single attack against all of them, as above. She divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among all hit foes, but her extra successes and rounds of control add dice to the damage rolls against each enemy.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by successfully grappling a crashed enemy using [[Chain-and-Armor Mortification]], or crashing a foe who’s grappled with her chains.
