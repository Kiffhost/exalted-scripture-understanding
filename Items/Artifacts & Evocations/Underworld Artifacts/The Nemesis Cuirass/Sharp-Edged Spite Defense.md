*The Nemesis Cuirass’ jagged barbs and spikes turn aside blades and pierce the flesh of unworthy foes.*
When an enemy makes a non-ranged attack against the wearer, she counterattacks with a ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) disarm gambit, which opposes the attack roll’s successes rather than the attacker’s [[Defense]]. If she has a negative Tie toward the attacker, she adds ([[Intimacy]]) dice on her attack and [[Initiative]] roll.
Against unarmed attacks, this is instead a damaging decisive attack, adding ([[Intimacy]]) dice on the attack and damage roll if the wearer has a negative Tie toward the attacker.
## Resonant
The wearer can make damaging counterattacks against enemies she has a negative Tie even if they use weapons to attack.
