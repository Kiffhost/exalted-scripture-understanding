*Sitting in quiet meditation, the Solar centers herself within the cycle of the elements and the forces of nature.*
Once per day, the Solar may use this Charm to generate motes that may only be used for activating [[Survival]] [[Charms]], and which vanish at the end of the day if they aren’t used. Roll the Exalt’s [[Charisma]] or [[Wits]] + [[Survival]] and add one to the result to determine how many motes the Solar is able to accrue.

### On [[Harmony with Nature Approach]]

Free motes to fuel your familiar’s Donkey Kong Rampage? Love me. Gotta learn [[Food-Gathering Exercise]] first? Curse me. Such is the life of the Exalted Developer.
