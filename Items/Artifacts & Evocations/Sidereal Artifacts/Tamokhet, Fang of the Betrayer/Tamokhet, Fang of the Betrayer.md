“I had arrived in Nexus in time to attend the annual gala thrown by Wilting Lily, a merchant prince famed for procuring the most obscure of treasures. Though she was well aware of my diminished personal fortunes, she was more than happy for me to peruse her stock and give my expert opinion of them, if only to improve her sales patter.” “My attention was drawn to a starmetal kakute, which, based on its inscription, I tentatively identified as Tamokhet, one of the lost Betrayer’s Tools. My host was delighted as I recounted its supposed provenance, known only from a digression in a medica materia of the Realm Before concerning the diseases of certain heavenly spiders. Sul-Xi, an obscure figure, slew by trickery a traitor among the spiders’ ranks. Its death-curse birthed a plague upon reality, contained only when Sul-Xi shattered it into nine different diseases and forged each into a terrible implement of treachery.” “Tamokhet, counted seventh among the nine, is linked to the inauspicious constellation of the Sword, of which I will speak no further. It may be the same needle described obliquely in Yasak Hala’s Histories of Treason, or the weapon with which Five-Faced Aknuris ended Old Zephyr’s Manuvian Dynasty of Old Zephyr. To my knowledge, no other records of the hand-needle survive.” “I took my leave before the auction concluded, but was told that Tamokhet went for an exorbitant sum. (Thanks in no small part to her paraphrase of my account, I’m sure.) No one I spoke to could recall the winning bidder’s appearance, which I fear cannot be solely attributed to the strength of their host’s libations. I left the city in haste, shortly before Wilting Lily was murdered by a treacherous conspiracy of her bodyguards, paramours, and advisors.” —Ledaal Kusam Valdris, One Thousand Shards of Jade
