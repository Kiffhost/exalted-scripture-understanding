*The Sidereal is accustomed to weaving disparate strands together into a cohesive whole.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, for each dot the Sidereal has in a Craft Ability, she gains an additional dot in another Craft Ability whose rating is equal or lower before adding these dots. When she purchases a Craft dot with experience points, she receives an additional dot in another Craft Ability with an equal or lower rating.
