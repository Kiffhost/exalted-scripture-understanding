Shimmering heat-haze and whirling snowflakes surround the wielder as she dances, fending off her foes.
She suffers no penalties for flurrying a full defense with a dance-based Performance action.
## Resonant
If the wielder’s Performance roll beats the Resolve of at least one nontrivial character, the Initiative cost of the full defense is refunded.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens at no cost when a Dragon-Blooded V’neef scion attunes the Dragon-Dancer’s Wings.
