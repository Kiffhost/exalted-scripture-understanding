Hundred Rivers has a Minor Tie of kinship towards his master upon first being summoned. At the end of each session, this Intimacy is strengthened one step if the Storyteller deems he had a positive experience with his master at any point during it. If he had a negative experience he deems his master’s fault, the Tie instead weakens by one step, and he flees her side to wander the wilderness. She cannot summon him again with Beckon the Wandering Wolf until a week has passed. Hundred Rivers, like Daring Venture itself, yearns to explore Creation. He won’t enter buildings, and exhibits great discomfort on paved surfaces. He especially loves sweet citrus fruits.

## SPECIAL ATTACKS
### Harry
If Hundred Rivers moves into close range of an enemy and deals 5+ withering damage on the same turn, that enemy cannot disengage on her next turn.
### Pack Hunting
Hundred Rivers considers his master and any of her Sworn Kin his pack. When Hundred Rivers attacks, he adds one automatic success for each packmate in close range of his target, maximum threesuccesses.
## MERITS

### Keen Nose
Hundred Rivers doubles 9s on scent-based Perception rolls.
### Marvel of Coat and Claw
Those who see Hundred Rivers’ master and her companions in the beast’s presence are treated as having a Minor Tie towards her, either positive or negative depending on how they view the legendary wolf. Dynastic youths might marvel at the sight of him, while Thousand Scales bureaucrats might find his presence distasteful.
### Wild Guardian
Hundred Rivers grants his master three automatic successes to Survival rolls to track quarry or find food, water, or shelter.
