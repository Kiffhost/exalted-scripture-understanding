*Eerie wings unfurl from the Abyssalâ€™s anima, beating down soundlessly to send her skyward.*
The Abyssal can fly with her movement actions, letting her move vertically or horizontally through the air and hover in place when not moving. If she uses [[Stepping Outside Existence]] while in flight to rush an airborne foe, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost.
In combat, the Abyssal must pay two motes or two [[Initiative]] at the start of each subsequent turn.
Otherwise, this Charm ends, causing her to drift harmlessly down to the ground.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can use this Charm reflexively at the apex of a leap made with [[Sky-Cleaving Wraith]], waiving its [[Willpower]] cost.
