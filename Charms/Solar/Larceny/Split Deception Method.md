*The Lawgiver walks through the valley of the wicked wearing a thousand faces.*
This Charm allows the Exalt to place a second disguise over the one she is wearing by attempting a second disguise action per the rules on page 224. This attempt may be supplemented by disguise [[Charms]] as usual. When she is seen wearing two or more disguises, the player dictates which disguise each witness sees. The Solar may sustain no more disguises than she has dots of [[Essence]].
