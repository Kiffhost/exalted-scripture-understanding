*The sorcerer calls on the irreal Domain of Nine Arches, where the Yozis once bound monstrous ambassadors to settle disputes during their initial voyages through the seas of chaos.*

The sorcerer summons a Conciliator of Enmities, a slug-like spirit the size of a wolf, with six delicate arms and a single eye of burning topaz. The Conciliator is a unique spirit. It’s naturally immaterial, though always visible to the sorcerer. If the sorcerer supplies it with someone’s name or a symbolic link to a character, like a scrap of clothing or lock of hair, the Conciliator vanishes, reappearing to visit that character a few minutes after the next sunset.

Upon appearing each night, the Conciliator makes a special instill roll with a dice pool of (sorcerer’s Essence + Perception + Occult). Success weakens the target’s strongest negative Tie to the sorcerer by one step . He can’t spend Willpower to resist this. If he doesn’t have such a Tie, this weakens his strongest Intimacy that would support enmity with the sorcerer.

The Conciliator also absorbs any of the target’s memories that cast the sorcerer specifically in a negative light. Weakening a Tie of romantic rivalry would erase a victim’s memories of the sorcerer kissing his husband, but weakening a Principle of belief in the Immaculate Philosophy wouldn’t affect memories of a monk’s sermon about mistrusting Anathema in general. If a target is left with no remaining Intimacies that the Conciliator could target, the erased memories are replaced with pleasant memories reflecting an affable and agreeable outlook on the sorcerer.

The Conciliator visits the victim again on the next two nights, repeating this process. After its third visit, the spirit returns to the sorcerer, bows once more, and departs.

If a victim is presented with convincing proof that his memories have been altered, he can pay (sorcerer’s Essence) Willpower to recover them and restore any weakened Intimacies to their original intensity. This doesn’t render him immune to the effects of the next night’s visitation.

The Conciliator can be banished prematurely if damaged with magic capable of striking dematerialized foes. Characters able to perceive it may initiate hostilities before it has the chance to assail the victim. It has (sorcerer’s Essence) Evasion, (sorcerer’s Intelligence) soak, and a single health level. If relevant, it has Join Battle, Stealth, and movement pools of (sorcerer’s Intelligence + Occult), but it can’t take any other actions. If damaged, it ruptures in a rush of foul air, ending the spell and undoing its Psyche effect as if the victim had spent Willpower to resist. If it isn’t slain by the start of its second turn in combat, it makes its influence roll and vanishes for the night.
# Control
Before the Conciliator departs, if it succeeded in weakening any Intimacies, it allows the sorcerer to remove its topaz eye, which immediately hardens into a gemstone. Once per day, the sorcerer can look through the gem to make a read intentions roll against the victim regardless of range, adding (Occult) bonus dice and inflicting the −2 Guile penalty for being unaware of her observation. Success reveals both the target’s current intentions and a glimpse of the target’s surroundings. The gem shatters if the target spends Willpower to resist the Psyche effect or if it’s broken by other magic.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 5)
A character can distort the spell if they interrupt the Conciliator before it feeds on its victim. Success causes it to depart for the night without assailing its victim, believing its duty is done.
