Night’s Sweet Whisper snuffs out the flames of hostility. The piper rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) with (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) bonus dice to inspire peace, ignoring [[Resolve]] bonuses for not employing spoken language. In addition to the usual effects, each affected character loses (1 + the piper’s extra successes against him) [[Initiative]], and one [[Initiative]] at the end of each of his turns (which the piper doesn’t gain). If a Lunar uses [[Charismatic Lunar Trick]] (p. XX) or [[Heart-Stirring Expression]] (p. XX) to enhance this roll, their costs are reduced by two motes each. This Evocation can only be used once per scene. 

## Resonant

The piper gains up to ([[Charisma]]) [[Initiative]] lost by affected characters from the initial roll.
