*Cornering their foe, the Lunar’s fellow warriors unleash a vicious coordinated assault.*
She makes a distract gambit, and if successful, each of ([[Essence]]) allies receives the full [[Initiative]] cost paid. As usual, this [[Initiative]] is lost if not used to make a decisive attack against the gambit’s target on each beneficiary’s next turn. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Lunar’s [[Initiative]] against an enemy with a −2 or greater onslaught penalty. 
## Protean 

In animal forms with Pack Hunting, the Lunar can grant [[Initiative]] to crashed allies. They still count as crashed for all purposes except making decisive attacks against the gambit’s target.
