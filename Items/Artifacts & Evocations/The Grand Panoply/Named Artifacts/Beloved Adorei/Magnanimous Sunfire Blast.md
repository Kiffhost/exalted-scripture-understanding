Striking against an opponent whose values he finds abhorrent, the Solar may use the Evocation to punish the wickedness of his foe. When he has revealed a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that is opposed to one of his own using the prerequisite, he may use the third Evocation of Adorei on a successful decisive attack to roll damage dice equal to the number of opposed Intimacies he has uncovered at any point using [[Heart-Knowing Blade]], at a rate of one mote per [[Intimacy]]. Adorei unleashes a burst of burning Solar [[Essence]] at the point of impact when this power is used.
