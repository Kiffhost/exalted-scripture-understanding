Flames stream from [[Blazerider]] as it flies, driving it forward at incredible speed. This Evocation increases its Speed Bonus by +1, and the flames that wreathe Blazerider’s edge grant +1 Overwhelming on withering attacks and double 10s on decisive damage rolls.
## Resonant
A Dragon-Blooded Ferem scion may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to extend this Evocation’s duration to one hour, increasing her flight speed to seventy miles per hour in addition to the above. Other resonant wielders may gain access to this benefit with a repurchase of this Evocation.
