*The Abyssal swears an oath of vengeance to stain the Old Laws red, binding herself to an insatiable need for bloody revenge.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when an enemy deals her a significant defeat or setback, violates one of her Major or Defining Intimacies in a significant way, or commits a similar wrong against her, or when learns of such an offense. She gains a Defining Tie of vengeful hatred towards the transgressor. This replaces any existing Ties she has toward them. It’s up to the Abyssal what form her vengeance will take, but it must be either proportional or excessive compared to the wrong done to her.
As long as the Abyssal retains this Tie at Defining intensity, she gains the following benefits:
 - She gains +2 [[Resolve]] against the offender, unless he leverages the Tie with an appeal to her hatred.
 - If she cites the Tie in a Decision Point, the cost to resist is reduced by one [[Willpower]].
 - She can use [[Venomous Scorn Rebuke]] against the offender without provocation. Instead of forming a new Tie of contempt, she applies the [[Resolve]] modifier bonus to this Charm’s [[Intimacy]].
The Abyssal can’t voluntarily weaken the Tie while this Charm remains active. If she goes a session without working toward her revenge at all, she loses one [[Willpower]].
Upon avenging herself, the Abyssal is filled with grim satisfaction, fully replenishing her motes and temporary [[Willpower]]. Her Tie is converted into a Defining Principle chosen by her player to reflect the impact of this experience on her worldview.
## Reset 
Once per story, unless reset by successfully attaining revenge. If the Abyssal maintains this Charm for multiple stories, she must wait until the current story ends for it to reset.
