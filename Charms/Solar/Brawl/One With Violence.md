The Exalted brawler does not meditate as the monks do, but her violent ruminations are no less weighty. Hers is not the way of blind instinct, but the force-honed circumstance of a natural disaster. This Charm enhances the crash bonus the Exalt earns for driving any target into crash with a [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] attack, awarding her extra [[Initiative]] equal to (her [[Essence]] or five, whichever is smaller).
