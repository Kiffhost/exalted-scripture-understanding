Articulated plate covers the wearer in interlocking metal plates held together by hinges and pins. Chain is only used to cover areas such as the armpits, groin and the back of the knees, where there’s no way for plate armor to mimic the human range of motion. Articulated plate provides superior protection and maneuverability to plate-and-chain and is less fatiguing to wear, but requires much greater skill and time to forge. It’s commonly available only in the Realm and in great cities such as Nexus and Lookshy.
