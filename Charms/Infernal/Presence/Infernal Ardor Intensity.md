*The Infernal’s passions are a whirlwind, a tempest, a rain of emerald hellfire to captivate and terrify all who behold her.*

The Infernal empowers one of her Intimacies based on emotion. She adds (Intimacy) dice on influence rolls made with any Ability and gains +1 Resolve against influence that opposes the chosen Intimacy. She reduces the cost of any Charms she uses with actions that receive this benefit by one mote each, minimum one. She doesn’t receive these benefits if her action violates or opposes the chosen Intimacy.

This Charm lasts one scene for five motes, or indefinitely for seven motes. It ends prematurely if the Infernal voluntarily weakens the chosen Intimacy or if it’s fully removed, and can’t be used for the rest of the day.
