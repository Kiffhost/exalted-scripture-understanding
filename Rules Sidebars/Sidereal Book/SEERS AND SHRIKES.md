[[Stab the Seer’s Eye]] is intended to oppose magic like [[God-King’s Shrike (Dogstar Ruminations)]], but the Storyteller should be judicious in introducing Sidereal opposition. If the players want to try to wipe the Imperial City off the map, they should expect to face [[Bronze Faction]] opposition — potentially the likes of [[Chejop Kejak]] — but there’s not a Sidereal for every possible disaster. The Storyteller should warn players if a particular prediction is likely to draw [[Yu-Shan|Heaven]]’s notice.
