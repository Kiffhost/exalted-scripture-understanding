*The Dragon-Blood weaves herself seamlessly into the company of thieves and gangsters.*
After spending at least an hour interacting with a particular criminal society, such as “the Nexus crime underworld” or “the Lintha family,” that she’s interacted within the past, she may gain a temporary [[Larceny]] specialty in interacting with it. The specialty also applies on any influence rolls she makes to convince others she belongs to that criminal group or to exploit that belief. She retains the specialty indefinitely, but may only have one specialty granted by this Charm at a time.
