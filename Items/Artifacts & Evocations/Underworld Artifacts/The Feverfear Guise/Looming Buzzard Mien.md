*The Feverfear Guise warns of terrible things to come, of rotten wings beating unseen, of villages abandoned or piled high with corpses.*
When the wearer draws on her medical expertise as part of an influence roll, she adds (Medicine/2) dice, can use applicable [[Medicine]] specialties, and may substitute [[Intelligence]] for [[Appearance]] to determine how many bonus dice it adds.
Against characters who sought the wearer out for her medical expertise, the added dice are non-Charm.
The same is true for threaten rolls and other fear-based influence rolls — for instance, warning that a water source is tainted — are non-Charm. She also gains this benefit on influence rolls made with this artifact’s other [[Evocations]].
## Resonant
The wearer may pay a two-mote surcharge to extend this Evocation’s duration to indefinite.
