The Dragon-Blood is one with her weapon. Roots spring from the bones of her wrists and hands and from her weapon’s grip, interlocking to form an unbreakable hold. She gains +1 Parry when blocking with the bound weapon, and the difficulty to disarm it increases by +2. In Wood Aura, this doesn’t count as a Charm bonus.
