*Viciously barbed chains erupt from the Abyssal’s armor, dragging victims to their dooms.*
While using [[Chain-and-Armor Mortification]], the Abyssal doesn’t suffer any of the usual penalties for grappling and can grapple using the chains’ full range. A successful grapple drags an enemy into close range.
