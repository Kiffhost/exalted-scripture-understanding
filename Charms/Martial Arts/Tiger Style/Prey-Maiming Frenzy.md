*Once the martial artist has seized hold of an enemy, she lays in with a flurry of brutal strikes, flaying skin and smashing bone until little but a bloody pulp remains.*
The martial artist makes a decisive savaging attack against a grappled enemy, adding her Strength to the raw damage of the attack. Every round of control she has over the clinch adds +1 to her base Initiative when she resets, although this cannot bring her above her Initiative at the time she made the attack. 
## Reset
Prey-Maiming Frenzy can only be used once per fight, unless reset by crashing a grappled enemy. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood cannot add more than her Essence to her base Initiative with this Charm.
