*Invoking Heaven’s favor, Godcarver’s master creates sanctified relics and holy treasures.*
When the wielder uses [[Heaven-Pleasing Altar]] in a place blessed with [[Temple-Consecrating Talent]], the god can answer the prayer by imbuing an [[Eclipse]] Charm or Evocation of the temple into a sacred talisman created by the wielder. Characters with mote pools and a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] who meet that power’s prerequisites can incur [[experience debt]] to learn it, paying eight points for [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]]. The wielder waives the [[experience debt]] for the first Charm or Evocation she learns this way. If a blessed object is destroyed or otherwise permanently leaves the narrative or if a character loses his qualifying [[Intimacy|Tie]], the imbued power’s experience cost is refunded. 
## Resonant
With an [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, characters without mote pools can use blessed objects, paying one [[Willpower]] for each five motes of its cost. 
## Dissonant
Only the wielder can benefit from blessed objects.
