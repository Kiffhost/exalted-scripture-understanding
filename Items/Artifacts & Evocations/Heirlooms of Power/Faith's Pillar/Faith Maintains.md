A life of virtue begins with a foundation of faith. Touching [[Faith’s Pillar]] to the ground, the wielder consecrates the ground on which she stands. As long as she doesn’t move from this point, she adds ([[Essence]] + the dedicated Principle) to her natural soak and gains ([[Essence]]) [[Hardness]]. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when a Dragon-Blooded Mnemon scion attunes to [[Faith’s Pillar]] with the proper dedication ritual.
