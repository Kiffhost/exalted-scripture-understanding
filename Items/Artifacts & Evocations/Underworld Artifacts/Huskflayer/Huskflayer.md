*To speak of fallen Chalazion, of its bone-orchards’ bitter fruits, of its skillful wound-leapers, is to tell the tragedy of Abeindor, the last of the shadowland’s ghost-kings.*
Cunning in statecraft and warfare, Abeindor nonetheless failed to see the threat that toppled his kingdom: a cult of soul-warping despair spread by the nephwrack prophet Bleeding-Throat Evangel. Mass suicides decimated Chalazion’s living as the Evangel’s teachings spread like a plague, while its dead fell into oblivion in droves.
As an exiled Abeindor drowned in his own despair, he was visited by a necromancer calling themself the Star of Dirt and Doubt. The Star offered him vengeance, though they warned of its terrible prince — but what had Abeindor left to lose? And so, the necromancer tore away the better part of his soul, and cast it upon their anvil. With it, she worked a binding on all Chalazion’s dead who had been loyal to Abeindor in life, forging their souls into [[Huskflayer]].
Abeindor fell upon his stolen kingdom like a storm from the Labyrinth’s depths. Behind him marched the shambling corpses of his once-living subjects, raised by the Star’s necromancy. By the end of Abeindor’s merciless campaign, the awful scythe had claimed more victims than he could remember, and none save him drew breath in Chalazion. The Evangel was last to fall. Asking a final faor of his mysterious patron, Abeindor bade the Star forge the nephwrack into a bauble of soulsteel, which still dangles from Huskflayer’s blade today.
With his vengeance complete, Abeindor had nothing. For a time, he turned [[Huskflayer]] to conquest, seeking new kingdoms to rule, but nothing eased the wound of lost Chalazion. Without purpose or passion, yet unable to find Lethe’s release, Abeindor finally condemned himself to oblivion. Then came the vultures, for the scythe had long been coveted by those who knew what the ghost king-did not: the weapon’s maker was a Deathlord in disguise.
Huskflayer’s design bespeaks cruelty. Its curving soulsteel blade does not cut cleanly, but tears away strips of flesh, which dangle from spiked flanges at the back of the blade like a wind-blown banner. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Huskflayer]]

Huskflayer’s [[Evocations]] are fueled by harvested flesh, represented by a pool of gore points (“g” in costs). This pool starts empty, and can store up to ten points. When the wielder deals decisive damage with [[Huskflayer]], she gains one point for each level of damage dealt. She can’t gain more than ([[Essence]]) points per round. Gore points last until spent.
This is subject to the following modifiers:
• Gore points can only be gathered from foes with flesh to harvest. Automata, animated skeletons, and similar creatures have nothing to offer [[Huskflayer]]. A ghost’s corpus counts as flesh, as does the substance of most other spirits.
• Incapacitating an enemy awards an additional point, but the wielder doesn’t gain points for damage in excess of her enemy’s Incapacitated level.
• If an enemy takes a crippling injury to negate decisive damage, the wielder still gains points for those levels.
• Against battle groups and enemies with Legendary [[Size]], double the point award. (The wielder still doesn’t reap points for dealing Magnitude damage to battle groups with withering attacks.) • Against trivial enemies, the wielder reaps only one point per attack.
As [[Huskflayer]] swells with stolen flesh, its blows grow more forceful. For every three gore points it has, add one damage die on decisive attacks and +1 Damage and +1 Overwhelming on withering attacks.
Gore points spent on [[Evocations]] that enhance an attack still count toward determining this damage bonus, and any similar bonuses from Huskflayer’s [[Evocations]].
