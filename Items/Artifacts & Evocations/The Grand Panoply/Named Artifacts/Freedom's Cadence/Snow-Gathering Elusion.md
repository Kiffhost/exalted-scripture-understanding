*The more snow accumulates in an avalanche, the more unstoppable its course down the mountain.*
Likewise does this armor carry the Exalt forward to her destiny, regardless of what lies in her path; the more momentum she builds, the more advantage she gains. Whenever the wearer successfully uses her [[Defense|Evasion]] to avoid an attack, she may activate the second Evocation of [[Freedom’s Cadence]] to add one to the armor’s soak for the rest of the scene. She may stack one additional use of this effect, for a maximum of +2 soak.
