The Sidereal glimpses ahead to the consequences of her possible decisions, narrowing her range of options. The Sidereal contemplates up to (Essence + 1) options she has in a given situation and her desired outcome. The Storyteller tells her player which of those options would be best for achieving that outcome in the short term. However, there’s no guarantee it’ll be beneficial in the long term, and the Sidereal receives no warning if all the options she proposes are bad ones. Once for a given situation.
