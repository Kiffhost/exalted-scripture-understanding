*The Infernal is untouched by the blades and chains of the so-called righteous, a shadow ever just beyond their grasp.*

The Infernal adds a non-Charm die on a disengage, withdraw, or take cover roll, plus an additional non-Charm die for each condition that applies:
- There’s no more than one nontrivial enemy within close range of her.
- She’s been hit by a decisive attack this scene.
- She’s in darkness or dim light sufficient to impose visibility penalties.
- She’s moving toward the exit of a confined space, or taking cover behind something between an exit and her enemies.
## Keys
#### Shadow Without Form (Dodge 3)
Each condition the Infernal meets also negates a point of penalty on her roll.
#### Untouched Gloaming Grace (Dodge 5, [[#Shadow Without Form (Dodge 3)|Shadow Without Form]]) (+1m)
For a one-mote surcharge, the Infernal doesn’t lose Initiative for disengaging. This surcharge is waived if she meets at least one condition.
#### Casting Long Shadows (Dodge 5, Essence 2, [[#Shadow Without Form (Dodge 3)|Shadow Without Form]]) (+5m)
The Infernal can pay a five-mote surcharge to make a disengage roll against an enemy at short range.
#### Darkening Distant Horizons (Dodge 5, Essence 2, [[#Shadow Without Form (Dodge 3)|Shadow Without Form]]) (+2m, 1wp)
For a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, a successful disengage lets the Infernal move two range bands away, instead of that action’s usual effect. She can’t use this key and attack on the same round.
#### Dusk Before Dawn (Dodge 5, Essence 2, [[#Untouched Gloaming Grace (Dodge 5, Shadow Without Form (Dodge 3) Shadow Without Form ) (+1m)|Untouched Gloaming Grace]]) (+2m, 2i)
For a two-mote, two-Initiative surcharge, the Infernal also treats a successful roll as a Stealth roll to establish concealment, as long as she ends her movement in a place that provides a suitable hiding place. She can’t use this key and attack on the same round.
