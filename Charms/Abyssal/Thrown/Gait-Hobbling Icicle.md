*The Abyssal’s weapon is rimed with deadly ice, freezing muscle and blood.*
If the Abyssal deals damage with a decisive attack, her target can’t take a reflexive move action on his next turn and increases his mobility penalty by one until the end of that turn. He can still move as a nonreflexive action, requiring a to take another action. If the target has successfully rushed or disengaged an enemy, he loses the reflexive movement from it if he takes 3+ damage. This is a crippling effect.
If the Abyssal deals 3+ damage to an airborne target, he also falls to the ground, landing prone. This doesn’t affect forms of flight that aren’t dependent on wings or similar physical features.
