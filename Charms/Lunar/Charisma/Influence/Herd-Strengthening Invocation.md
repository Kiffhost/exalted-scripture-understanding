*The divine predator forces the herd closer together.*
The Lunar speaks on or gives a performance relating to a custom of a culture she has a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward. The specifics depend on her [[Intimacy|Tie]]’s emotional context. If it’s positive, her address reveals the custom’s virtues and merit; if it’s negative, she speaks against the custom to incite the crowd’s outrage against her. Audience members belonging to the relevant culture are treated as having a [[Intimacy|Principle]] embodying the chosen custom for this Charm’s duration. Its intensity equals that of the Lunar’s [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the culture when she used this Charm. They gain its benefits, but others can’t leverage it against them with social influence. They aren’t forced to obey it but lose this benefit if they violate it. If the Lunar completely loses her [[Intimacy|Tie]] to a culture, this Charm ends. This Charm can be stacked up to ([[Essence]]) times.
