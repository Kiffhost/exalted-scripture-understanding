By abstaining from rich foods, drugs, sexual intercourse, and other indulgences that compromise the balance of forces within her body, the sorcerer may draw greater power from within. So long as she abides by this ascetic lifestyle, she receives (Stamina) sorcerous motes after a night of sleep, plus additional sorcerous mote for every point of [[deprivation]] penalties she suffers. These sorcerous motes last until she next sleeps, and can be spent towards any spell she casts. Additionally, once per story, she may spend a scene in meditation to unlock (Essence + Stamina) sorcerous motes which last the duration of the story. Compromising the ascetic lifestyle of this shaping ritual causes the sorcerer to lose all motes granted by it, and denies her its benefits for the remainder of the story.
