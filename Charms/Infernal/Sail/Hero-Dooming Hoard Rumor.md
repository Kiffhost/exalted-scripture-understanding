*The Infernal lures the avaricious and foolhardy to an unpleasant demise.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have first hidden something of value — or at least, apparent value. She tells others of this hidden treasure, making a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Sail) persuade roll with double 9s to convince them to seek it out. Onlookers don’t realize that she’s employing any form of influence.

If the Infernal reveals the treasure’s nature, this influence becomes harder to resist based on its apparent value:
- **Resources 1**: No effect.
- **Resources 2-3**: The Infernal doubles 8s.
- **Resources 4-5**: The Infernal doubles 7s and increases the level of Intimacy needed to resist the influence by one step. Characters with Defining Intimacies must instead pay an additional Willpower to resist.
- **Artifact 2-5**: As above, but the level of Intimacy needed to resist is always Defining. The Willpower cost to resist is increased by (Artifact/2, rounded up), or by four points for an Artifact N/A.

Alternatively, the Infernal can leave the treasure’s nature unspecified, letting targets guess wildly at what it might be. If they have an Intimacy that could feasibly support the Infernal’s influence, targets will assume whatever fits that Intimacy best.

If the Infernal learns that the treasure’s been retrieved, she can no longer use it for this Charm.
