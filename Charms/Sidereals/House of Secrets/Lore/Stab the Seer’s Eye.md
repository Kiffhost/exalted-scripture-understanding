*Mortal astrologers who try to read the Sidereal’s destiny in the stars are struck blind to her secrets.*
When a character uses magic to scry on the Sidereal from afar or to predict her future, she becomes aware of this and asserts her Guile against his roll. If the effect is unrolled, that character rolls (Perception + Occult).
If he fails, the Sidereal learns his identity and dictates what his prophecy or scrying reveals.
Alternatively, this Charm can negate magic that guarantees some outcome will come to pass, like Transcendent Hatchet of Fate (p. 275). If such an effect would harm or impede the Sidereal, an employee of the Celestial Bureaucracy, or someone the Sidereal has a Major or Defining Tie for, she becomes aware of the effect and the identity of the character responsible. If she wins a notable victory over him — defeating him in combat, turning the audience against him in a debate, driving his business bankrupt — that effect is negated.
