Moving her hands through lightning-quick strikes to an enemy’s shadow, the martial artist corrupts it with her own Essence, warping it into a weapon of silent murder that betrays its master. When the martial artist makes an unexpected attack against an enemy, she may unleash the Umbra Noose Execution, a decisive attack that warps the enemy’s shadow into a razor-edged chain that coils around its master’s neck, raising him into the air. The umbra noose adds a number of dice equal to the total successes she received on her Stealth roll to the raw damage of the attack (to a maximum of [Essence x 2]). 

## Mastery

In addition to inflicting damage, the next five motes the opponent spends during the scene are funneled away by his traitor shadow and given to the Ebon Shadow stylist. The stylist may only spend these motes to pay for Ebon Shadow style Charms, and vanish at the end of the scene if still unused.
