The Lawgiver can reconstruct the statements of a witness so perfectly that the Solar gains a psychic vision of any case scene (Exalted p. 224) or profile character (Exalted p. 225) action the character describes. So long as that character has undertaken such an action, the Exalt can analyze the evidence or the profiled character as if she were there, adding her own Wits or Perception + Investigation roll to the witness’s own result and making an even more profound or clear reading of the situation. The Lawgiver may use Judge’s Ear Technique to evaluate any statements heard by the witness during this psychic vision, and she may use the Investigation Excellency to amplify her roll, but she may not use any Simple-type Charms or Charms which would require her to handle evidence in order to fill out the witness’s testimony.

### On Truth-Rendering Attitude

The backer wanted me to create a Charm for his Solar “Gavin of Nighthammer,” that would allow him to make a remote investigation through the eyes of a familiar or a subordinate. I decided to go with an approach that allows you to finish an action started by another, to model a great detective who can hear someone’s analysis of a crime scene and solve it instantly, or who can take their incomplete read on a particularly inscrutable or mysterious person, and give a full composite of that person and their most probable identity. Note that if someone tries to describe an event they did not witness, this Charm simply reveals nothing to the Solar. She should probably use the prerequisite to evaluate what she’s hearing. Also I decided to make it Mute to offset the weighty price. Backer: Ryan “Galby” Galbraith
