The deepest wilds are no mystery to the [[Solar Exalted]]. With this Charm, the Exalt can find her way safely through even the worst terrain. The Solar and a group of up to ([[Essence]] * 2) followers can travel up to 10 miles a day across the harshest terrain, and 20 miles per day across normal wilderness. The Solar automatically succeeds at any [[Survival]] roll to find the next oasis, natural shelter, river or other topographical feature the region might include.
