Adorei has dreams a daiklave should never have, and like all magic of the First Age, she is a thing which should not exist. To save her Solar’s life, Beloved Adorei may trade her own to activate this final Evocation. Adorei does not die instantly—she will stay alive until combat has ended before gradually fading out. Although Adorei knows she can never truly be her Solar’s wife, this Evocation grants her a wedding dance in which she recites her vows: 
- First Vow - Your Blood Is Mine: On a round in which the Solar successfully defends against every attack made against him, Adorei heals one of the Solar’s damaged health levels, starting with the -4 levels and going upward. If the Solar takes no attacks, nothing is healed. This power does not function in crash. 
- Second Vow - I Am Your Aegis: The Solar gains one point of Initiative at the start of each turn. This power functions in crash. 
- Third Vow - Life and Death Through Me: As they dance their final dance, no wound or social penalties can hurt the Solar’s Resolve or Guile. His own Intimacies can still be used to modify his Resolve downward or upward. Though it disgusts Adorei, she can know the Intimacies of the Solar’s attackers through their own attacks; when the Solar is struck with successful decisive damage, she can reveal a number of pertinent Intimacies equal to the damage successes. The Storyteller should draw from the Intimacies which are most likely to allow the Solar to unnerve, intimidate, or confuse the Solar’s foes. He then gains three automatic successes to threaten or instill emotions in his opponents which lower their defenses, sap their Initiative, or imposes penalties on their attack according to the profundity of the player’s social stunt and the Storyteller’s creativity. 

*Quoth the Daiklave:* “Challala chalandora Adorei.”
