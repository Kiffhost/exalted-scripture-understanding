Anointing a spirit’s brow with her own blood, the Sidereal binds it to serve her as a guardian. The Sidereal makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) instill roll against a touched spirit. Success instills a Principle requiring the spirit to protect something the Sidereal has a positive Tie toward with an intensity equal to that her Tie. The spirit can’t act against the instilled Principle, voluntarily weaken it, or retaliate against the Sidereal for binding him unless he enters a Decision Point and spends one [[Willpower]] to resist for a scene. If the [[Intimacy]] is ever fully removed, it reforms at Minor intensity at the beginning of the next scene. This Psyche effect last one story or until a spirit has spent (Sidereal’s [[Essence]] + 2) total [[Willpower]] resisting it. Fire and water elementals and other spirits associated with those elements are especially vulnerable to this Charm. The instilled Principle is always Defining and they can’t spend [[Willpower]] to retaliate against the Sidereal.
