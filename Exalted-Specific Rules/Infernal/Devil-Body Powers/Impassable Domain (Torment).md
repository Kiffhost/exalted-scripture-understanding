Those exposed to the Torment suffer the effects of difficult terrain until the end of their next turn, representing shifting ground, an area filled with webs of glassy fibre, an impairing sense of vertigo or similar effects. The Infernal can stunt to create new terrain appropriate to her powers within the area of her Torment, such as creating a jagged wall she can conceal herself behind by touching the ground with her [[Devil-Body#Torments|Hellish Touch]].

If this Torment has an Area [[Devil-Body#Torments|vector]], or if the Infernal has the [[Expansive Form]] power, those affected by her difficult terrain lose a point of Initiative when they enter it or start their turn in it.
