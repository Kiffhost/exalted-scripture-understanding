The Dragon-Blood channels elemental [[Essence]] into a deadly blast. Air manifests as crackling lightning; Earth as flying stones; Wood as poisoned thorns; and so on. This is a withering or decisive attack with ([[Dexterity]] + [Archery or Thrown]) against an enemy within short range, which can be enhanced with [[Charms]] of the appropriate combat Ability. The Exalt may spend a level of anima to extend this to medium range. This Charm’s elemental aspect is the same as the Exalt’s, and it gains additional benefits based on its element. Air: The elemental bolt deals lethal damage and ignores (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) soak or ([[Essence]]) hardness from metal armor, including the five magical materials. Earth: The elemental bolt deals bashing damage and has the Smashing tag (Exalted, p. 586). Fire: The elemental bolt deals lethal damage. Decisive attacks double 10s on damage. Water: The elemental bolt deals bashing damage and has the Flexible and Disarming tags (Exalted, p. 586). Wood: The elemental bolt deals lethal damage. Decisive attacks carry a poison with Damage 1i/round (B in Crash), Duration ([[Essence]] + 5), and penalty −1. The Dragon-Blood may purchase additional elemental variants of this Charm for three experience points each. ELEMENTAL BOLT [[Accuracy]]: +5 Close; +4 Short; +3 Medium; −0 Long; −2 Extreme; Damage: 10 + [[Essence]] (doesn’t add [[Strength]]); Overwhelming: ([[Essence]] + 1)
