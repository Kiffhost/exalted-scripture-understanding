Such is the Lunar’s exuberance in her own apparent good fortune that rivals don’t notice as she pulls cards from her sleeves or swaps honest dice for weighted sets. She doubles 7s on a roll with any Attribute to cheat at a game of chance or similar contest without being noticed, or to poison food, drink, or a weapon unnoticed. This Charm’s efficacy diminishes with repetition — the second time she uses it in a scene, she doubles 8s; all subsequent uses that scene double 9s.
