*The stylist lurches across the battlefield, flickering between bursts of inhuman speed and the marionette gait of the hungry dead as she strikes.*
When the stylist beats an enemy’s [[disengage]] roll or when an enemy provokes her reflexive movement from a [[rush]], she can use this [[Charm]] to make a decisive attack against him. If she deals 3+ damage, he can’t take [[movement]] actions until after his next turn.
## Terrestrial
This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round — or the next round, if she’s already attacked.
