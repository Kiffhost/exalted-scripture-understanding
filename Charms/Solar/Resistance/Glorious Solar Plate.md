*The Solar bends her anima into a suit of armor in the form of hardened sunfire, bearing all the glorious colors of Solar anima.*
This armor has stats identical to artifact heavy armor (+11 soak, 10 hardness, -2 mobility), and if the Exalt has mastered the [[Armored Scout’s Invigoration]], [[Glorious Solar Plate]] activates its effects for free. [[Glorious Solar Plate]] may graft itself over a suit of armor, appearing as a series of interlinked cosmic runes that describe the ascent of the Unconquered Sun to the zenith of heaven at the birth of the universe. This upgrades the armor’s traits if they are lesser than that of [[Glorious Solar Plate]], and adds the armor-enhancing powers of this Charm to the Lawgiver’s current set. If the Solar’s current armor is attuned, grafting [[Glorious Solar Plate]] onto it replaces the commitment cost, releasing the attuned motes. For additional purchases, the player may grant [[Glorious Solar Plate]] custom [[Evocations]]. The player should work with the Storyteller to create [[Evocations]] that exude the nature of the Exalt’s iconic anima manifestation. In addition, [[Glorious Solar Plate]] has the following powers: Heavens-Blazing Aura: Against energy-based decisive projectiles such as [[Blazing Solar Bolt]] and [[Flight of the Brilliant Raptor]], this armor gains (the greater of [[Essence]] or three) decisive soak. This defense applies even when the Solar is crashed. Unbreakable Sustaining Grip: The armor automatically treats crippling damage to joints and limbs, setting and stabilizing broken bones with binding [[Essence]] and channeling the Solar’s pain out through her anima. As a result, the Solar’s limbs cannot be hacked off and her bones and joints can’t be rendered dysfunctional while she is wearing [[Glorious Solar Plate]]. 

## Special activation rules

[[Glorious Solar Plate]] is expressly allowed to be used in combination with [[Whirlwind Armor-Donning Prana]], so that a suit of armor can be quickly donned and simultaneously enhanced by this Charm’s effects. Used on its own, [[Glorious Solar Plate]] appears already-equipped, perfectly fitted to the Solar’s form.
