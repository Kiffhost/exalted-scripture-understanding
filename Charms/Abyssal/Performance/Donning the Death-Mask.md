*The Abyssal thespian has no identity but what she chooses to show her audience.*
The Abyssal can use Performance instead of Socialize when calculating Guile. She gains +1 non-Charm Guile while acting in a performance. Likewise, if she disguises herself, feigns death, or uses Wicked Stagecraft Expertise, she gains this bonus against effects that would reveal the truth.
