Through quick action, the Solar may obscure someone with her own efforts to remain hidden. The Solar must be touching the one she wishes to hide, and must herself attempt a Stealth action at the same time. The Solar works to obscure her charge, covering him with her body, shrouding him with her cloak, or guiding him into a cleverly concealed niche. Add half the Solar’s successes (rounded up) and any stunt bonuses on this action as dice to her charge’s own Stealth roll.
