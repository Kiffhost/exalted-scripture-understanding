*The Lunar’s muscles ripple like flowing water as she strikes, magnifying her blow’s force.*
She makes a decisive attack, adding one success on the damage roll. With 3+ successes on the damage roll, she knocks her target back one range band. If this bashes him against an object or surface, she rolls an additional (Strength/2, rounded up) damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This is normally bashing, although some objects may inflict lethal damage. With 5+ damage roll successes, she can knock him back two range bands, increasing collision damage to ([[Strength]]). Ranged attacks can’t knock enemies beyond medium range, though they still suffer full impact damage. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Deadly Charge, the Lunar doubles her damage roll successes when determining how far she may knock back her victim.
