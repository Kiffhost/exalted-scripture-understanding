*Earth nurtures wood.*
Wood fuels fire. Fire becomes smoke, diffusing into air. Air condenses, and rains down as water.
Water enriches the earth, beginning the cycle anew. Thus do the elements of Creation proceed, the foremost among the many elemental cycles studied by savants and occultists.
Jurul Koba Kiriji forged [[Fivefold Dragons’ Grasp]] to further his understanding of this cycle, creating them not as a weapets is fashioned to resemble a dragon’s claws, with each finger composed of a different color of jade.
Each gauntlet’s palm houses a lens of flawless adamant, a prism through which the five elements become one.
Kiriji died before his house was cast down and replaced with House Ledaal, slain in the Wyld Hunt against the blasphemous Eater of Tongues. His daughter, Ledaal Koba Mukar, took up [[Fivefold Dragons’ Grasp]] to avenge him, the first of many deeds in her career as a storied monster slayer. In some generations, the gauntlets have been inherited by a sorcerer or savant — Ledaal Vuyen used them to unravel the elemental enigma-vaults of the Court of Dark Skies’ spirit prince, while Ledaal Pakayu, the Winter Flame, averted a potential schism within the Immaculate [[Order]] by drawing on her insights into the cycle to pen the Sutra of Reconciliation.
In others, their masters have been warriors devoted to the Great House’s Shadow Crusade — Ledaal Remanis, who burned the Voice Serpent to death from within; the outcaste-born Ledaal Empty Chamber, scourge of the fae Court of Formless Dancers; and Ledaal Kebok Adenu, who slew the Anathema Helltusk while besieging Garianghis.
