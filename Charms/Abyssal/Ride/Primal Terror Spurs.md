*The Abyssal’s steed surges forward as if pursued by all the horrors of the Underworld.*
The deathknight gains the following benefits for one hour:
 - She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) successes on mounted movement rolls.
 - When she succeeds on a mounted rush, she gains two [[Initiative]]. If her mount is rolled into combat, it also gains two [[Initiative]].
 - Outside of combat, her mount can carry her at incredible speed: she can cover a distance that would normally take an hour to cross in ten minutes, a distance that would take a day to cross in a handful of hours, or a distance that would take a week to cross in a day.
This Charm’s cost is reduced to two motes, one [[Willpower]] while [[Ridden to the Bone]] is active. If the Abyssal reactivates this Charm when its effect runs out, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost.
