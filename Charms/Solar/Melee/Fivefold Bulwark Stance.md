*Accepting no form of defeat, the Solar gazes along the edge of her blade and sees what it would see. The ebb and flow of battle becomes clear to her; she sees the arcs of incoming attacks as glowing trails of [[Essence]], and moves with impossible, fluid speed to strike the path of all harm.*
For a full scene, the Exalt may ignore certain penalties to her [[Defense|Parry]] [[Defense]] and reduce the cost to use [[Bulwark Stance]] by two motes and [[Dipping Swallow Defense]] by one. In addition, when she uses [[Dipping Swallow Defense]], it raises her [[Defense|Parry]] [[Defense]] by one.

### Sidebar
Fivefold [[Bulwark Stance]] ignores wound penalties, onslaught penalties, penalties from being grappled, and penalties incurred from being hit by temporary physically crippling techniques other than those that affect the senses. However, it is vulnerable to attacks that cripple the senses, such as those that cause blindness or dizziness, and attacks which physically stun the Solar (such as [[Ox-Stunning Blow]]). Poisons and illusions may also cut through the Solarâ€™s [[Defense]] through use of this Charm. Thus [[Fivefold Bulwark Stance]] deals handily with the most common group attack tactics, but is vulnerable to more specialized tactics. These penalties do not apply to [[Dipping Swallow Defense]] or [[Bulwark Stance]].
