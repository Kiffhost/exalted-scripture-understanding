Holding a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Expectant Maiden against her throat like a blade, the Sidereal murders her most closely cherished dreams on the altar of necessity. The Sidereal sacrifices a hopeful Defining Intimacy, cutting it from her heart so that she can never gain it again by any means. If it’s a Tie toward someone, he senses the Sidereal abandoning her hopes for him. Heaven recognizes this sacrifice: beneath the Violet Bier of Sorrows, a basalt sepulcher’s sealed gates swing open, unleashing the divine intervention of something imprisoned by Saturn before history’s dawn. The Storyteller determines both what form this intervention takes and its mechanical effects, but some things are always true. It will always substantially alter the Sidereal’s immediate situation in a way that significantly and unambiguously advantages her, no matter how great the opposition she faces. This intervention reflects both endings and the sacrificed hope in some way and will never contravene destiny. Any harmful effects it inflicts on nontrivial enemies can be defended against with opposed rolls or static values. Reset: Once per story.
