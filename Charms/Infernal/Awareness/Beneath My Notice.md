*Does a titan pause to regard an ant before trampling it underfoot?*

Whenever an enemy that the Infernal is unaware of comes within short range of her, she reflexively makes a decisive attack against him. She strikes without thought, not even aware of her own attack. If she deals 3+ damage, he must reroll Stealth to maintain his concealment, using the lower of the two results. The Infernal remains ignorant of her enemy no matter what.
### Keys 
#### Oblivious Titan Unshaken
The Infernal can use this Charm to clash an unexpected attack against her. She can clash an ambush if she uses it together with [[Threat-Monitoring Excitement]], rather than using her Defense against the ambush. She can use other Charms to enhance the clash attack normally.
