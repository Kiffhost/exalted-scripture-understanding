The Sidereal’s eyes flash with blue fire she makes the Lesser Sign of the Lovers against someone, striking his name from the Division of Serenity’s rolls of those who will find love. The Sidereal rolls (Manipulation + Socialize) against the Resolve of a character within medium range. If she succeeds, it becomes impossible for any character to have a Tie of love — romantic, familial, or otherwise — toward the victim by any means, even magic. Characters who already have such Ties lose them unless they’re nontrivial and their Resolve exceeds the Sidereal’s Manipulation, in which case their player changes the Tie’s context to a different one. Characters whose Essence exceeds the Sidereal’s may spend one Willpower to resist this altogether. The Sidereal’s victim may break free of this curse by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) that upholds a Defining Tie of love to someone who’s ever had a positive Defining Tie toward him. The curse laid on this Charm’s victim is a fate-altering Shaping effect. Its impact on other characters is a Psyche effect. Reset: This Charm can only be used on a specific character once per story.
