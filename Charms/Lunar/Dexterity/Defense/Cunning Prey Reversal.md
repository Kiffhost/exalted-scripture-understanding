*The Lunar is always just beyond her enemyâ€™s reach, an untouchable mirage that grows only more distant as he advances.*
She adds +1 [[Defense|Evasion]] against a decisive attack. If she successfully dodges, she gains any [[Initiative]] her attacker loses for missing. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]], the Lunar may use this Charm after an attack roll.
