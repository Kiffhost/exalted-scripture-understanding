*The Abyssal knows the ways of the ruthless and the desperate, effortlessly insinuating herself into the criminal underworld.*
The deathknight may reflexively invoke any of the following attitudes. Each can be leveraged with social influence as though it were a Minor Tie.
Familiarity: Criminals perceive the deathknight as a fellow criminal, viewing her as a potential accomplice to be recruited, a threat to their turf, or potentially as a member of their own organization.
Menace: The Abyssal exudes terror. Criminals and those who are frequently victimized by criminals view her as a threat to be avoided — a serial killer, vigilante, or similar peril.
Receptivity: The Abyssal adapts the bearing of one open to illicit business. Characters seeking to solicit illegal or seedy services perceive the Abyssal as the perfect procurer of whatever they wish to obtain, while those offering such services perceive her as a desirable customer.
Vulnerability: The Abyssal chooses a specific crime. Characters intending to commit that crime will view her as their ideal victim — charlatans see her as a guileless rube, thieves as a wealthy and inattentive target, and so on.
Only one of these attitudes can be active at a time, but the Abyssal can change between them reflexively.
