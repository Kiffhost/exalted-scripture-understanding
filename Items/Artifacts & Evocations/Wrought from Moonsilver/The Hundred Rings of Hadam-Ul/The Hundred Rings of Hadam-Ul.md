*Once, there was a serpent.*
It swam the seas of Creation and the Wyld, born of neither world but a terror to both. It was a creature of uncertainty — sometimes large enough to blot out the sun, other times finer than a single strand of hair. No net could catch it; no harpoon could pierce it; even names slid off the beast, which was and remains nameless. In the end, it fell to Hadam-Ul, a Lunar of modest renown but boundless patience. He followed the behemoth for 100 days and nights, testing its strength and observing its habits. Each day, he dove into the water, grappled with the serpent, and tied another knot into its body before it escaped. With his 100th knot, HadamUl tied its tail to its head — for it could not escape itself. Out of respect for his prey — and to end the suffering of a beast unable to die — Hadam-Ul forged it into a dire chain, transforming each knot into a linked ring of moonsilver. The serpent’s spirit abides inside the Hundred Rings, eager for a master who’ll unleash it to hunt anew.
