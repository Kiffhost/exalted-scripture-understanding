*Every detail of the Lunar’s bearing radiates predatory menace.*
She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on rolls to threaten others or [[instill]] [[Intimacy|Ties]] of fear toward herself (or her current form). A character affected by such a roll can’t initiate hostilities against her that scene unless another character does or he spends one [[Willpower]]. Even then, he suffers a −(Lunar’s [[Essence]]) penalty to [[Join Battle]]. 
## Protean
In predatory animal shapes, the added dice are non-Charm.
