The Sidereal’s blade is still as untroubled waters, waiting patiently for a perfect opportunity to strike. To use this Charm, the Sidereal must be aiming at an enemy whose Initiative is lower than that of all allies. She makes a withering or decisive attack against him, doubling her attack roll extra successes to determine a withering attack’s raw damage or adds them as dice of decisive damage. Alternatively, when the Sidereal makes a counterattack or clash against an enemy whose Initiative is lower than all allies’ while benefitting from a full defense, she can use this Charm reflexively to enhance it, without needing to aim. Reset: Once per scene unless reset by incapaciting an enemy with an attack that benefitted from aiming or a counterattack or clash while using a full defense.
