*The Solar’s sense of touch is attuned to movement in the world around her.*
When a hidden character attempts to move across a surface connected to one the Solar is touching, he accrues an additional -2 penalty to his [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] roll, in addition to the regular -3 penalty detailed on page 204. This Charm functions within short range of the Solar. She can touch a tree trunk and feel something moving in the lowest branches, sense footsteps approaching her in a pitch black hallway, and other, similar feats. If the target is within range of the Solar’s extended touch upon rolling [[Join Battle]], the Exalt gains three non-Charm dice to her [[Join Battle]] roll so long as she cannot see her opponent. If the Exalt has learned [[Unsurpassed Hearing and Touch Discipline]], she can feel such movements out to medium range, and can determine the size, shape, and velocity of her target. She can feel a siaka circling beneath her ship, and she can differentiate between a gecko or an assassin lizard climbing down a wall she’s leaning against.
