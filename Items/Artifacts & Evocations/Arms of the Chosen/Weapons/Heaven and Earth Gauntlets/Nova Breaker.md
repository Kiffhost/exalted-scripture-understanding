*The [[Heaven and Earth Gauntlets]] are limned with [[Essence]], coruscating along the wielder’s arms as she strikes and detonating in a prismatic burst at the moment of impact.*
To use this Evocation, the wielder must have successfully hit an opponent with a smash attack since her last turn, and he must not have risen from prone yet. She moves one range band towards that opponent and makes a decisive attack against him, adding up to ([[Strength]]) threshold successes to the attack’s damage. This doesn’t count as her movement action for the round.
