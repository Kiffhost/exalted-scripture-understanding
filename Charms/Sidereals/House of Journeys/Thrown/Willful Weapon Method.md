*The Sidereal throws both her weapon and its shadow, speeding inexorably toward her enemy’s heart.*
The Sidereal makes a decisive attack. If she misses, she doesn’t lose Initiative for doing so and reflexively makes a second attack with her weapon’s shadow against the same target. It has (Initiative/2, rounded down) base damage. Success on the second attack doesn’t reset the Sidereal’s Initiative; instead, she loses Initiative equal to her successes on the damage roll. If the second attack hits, the Sidereal gains one Willpower.
