*Theft is Sozen’s [[Essence]].*
This Evocation supplements a withering attack. If successful, the wearer makes a reflexive pickpocket roll (Exalted, p. 224) against the target. The wielder may forgo any amount of [[Initiative]] earned from the attack to add that many bonus dice on the ([[Dexterity]] + [[Larceny]]) roll. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wearer isn’t dissonant with orichalcum, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she successfully steals a useful or valuable treasure from a demon or other being of Malfeas. 

## Resonant

The wielder gains 1 [[Initiative]] if the pickpocket roll succeeds.
