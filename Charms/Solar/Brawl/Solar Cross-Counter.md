The Solar exploits her opponentâ€™s attack to unload a vicious counterstrike. This Charm may only be used after the Solar has taken withering damage from an opponent at close range. She may use this Charm to launch an immediate decisive attack with a base damage of the number of withering damage she just took, and she may unleash this counterattack even if she has already used her attack action for the round. Damage done by this counterattack does not reset the Solar to base Initiative. At Essence 3+, the Solar may pay an extra Willpower to drop the perilous keyword from this Charm for one instant.
