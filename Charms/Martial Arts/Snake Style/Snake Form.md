The martial artist steps back into the posture of a wary snake—head back, ready to attack or retreat. Her motions become sinuous and hypnotic, as mesmerizing as they are deadly. Enemies are entranced by this posture, taking a -1 penalty on all attack rolls against her—which increases to a -3 penalty if their Initiative rating is lower than the martial artist’s. In addition, this flexible pose makes it easier to roll with attacks and thus minimize their impact, adding the stylist’s Dexterity rating to her soak. 

## Special activation rules

Whenever the martial artist makes a withering attack which lowers an enemy’s current Initiative value from greater than her own to less than her own, she may reflexively activate Snake Form.
