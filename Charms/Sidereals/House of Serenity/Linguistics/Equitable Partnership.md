The Sidereal feels along the weave of fate for a patron with pockets deep enough to fund her ambitions. After a few hours or days spent discussing a business plan or opportunity for profit with potential financial backers, the Sidereal’s assured to find at least one person willing to fund her scheme, providing a sum proportionate to the Sidereal’s competence and the plan’s plausibility. That character forms a Major [[Intimacy]] reflecting his commitment to this arrangement, which could be a Tie to the Sidereal or a Principle reflecting his motivation for funding her. With a [[Linguistics]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may roll ([[Charisma]] + [[Linguistics]]) to seek out a supernatural being as a patron. The Storyteller chooses who or are what kind of being she secures patronage from, but the Sidereal’s roll determines his strength: Every two successes let her gain one dot worth of [[Allies]], [[Mentor]], or [[Retainers]]. At the end of the story, the [[Merits]] are lost unless the Sidereal qualifies to retain them as Story [[Merits]] (Exalted, p. 158).
