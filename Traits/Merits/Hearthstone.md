*This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.*
This Merit bestows ownership of a hearthstone—a gem formed of concentrated geomantic Essence, bearing potent magical powers. Most hearthstones radiate broad mystical benefits into the region surrounding them, but some rarer stones have more concentrated or direct powers, or even hide a handful of potent Evocations within their depths.
Most hearthstones are deliberately formed through Essence concentration in manses, but a few hearthstones naturally form in demesnes or at sites where Essence has worked prodigious miracles upon the land. If a hearthstone is linked to a manse, and the manse’s owner places the hearthstone in a specially-designed socket in an attuned artifact, then the character enjoys the benefits of standing within the manse wherever she goes (see the Manse Merit, p. 163).
Two dots in this Merit represents the power of most hearthstones in Creation, while four dots provides a greater hearthstone from an exceptionally powerful manse or demesne.
