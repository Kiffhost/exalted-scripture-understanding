Clearing her mind of all thoughts, the Solar focuses only on the arrow drawn back against her bowstring, feeling for the flow of Essence she needs to make an incredible shot. The Solar must take a special “long aim” action—an aim action lasting three rounds—against a single target in order to use this Charm. Invoking Seven Omens Shot converts the normal +3 bonus dice from aiming into three automatic non-Charm successes and adds any extrasuccessesontheattackrolltotheattack’srawdamage. Accuracy Without Distance can shorten the action by a singleround,butmayonlyaddasinglenon-Charmsuccess for each round shortened. Killing an opponent with this Charm awards the Solar one point of Willpower.
