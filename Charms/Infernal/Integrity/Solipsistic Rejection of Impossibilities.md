*Such is the Infernal’s conviction in her own primacy that the world does not dare to defy her.*

The Infernal perfectly defends against a Psyche effect, Shaping effect, or sorcerous curse. She gains a Major Derangement that expresses her belief that she couldn’t have been affected, or its psychological consequences (Exalted, p. 168). She might succumb to Paranoia to resist an attempt win her trust by altering her memories, or suffer Megrims after rejecting a mentally overwhelming wave of joy. If none of the listed Derangements are a good fit, the Infernal’s player can instead take a Major Principle instead, though it’s still considered a Derangement.

The Infernal can commit this Charm’s cost indefinitely to become immune to any further Psyche, Shaping, and sorcerous curses, as long as her Derangement’s rationale applies to them. The Charm ends if she loses that Derangement.

If the Infernal already has a Derangement from a previous use of Solipsistic Rejection of Impossibilities, it’s overwritten by the new Derangement. If the previous Derangement still applies against the effect the Infernal defends against, she instead increases the old Derangement’s intensity by one step, rather than forming a new one.

With Essence 5, the Infernal can choose to form a Defining Derangement, rather than a Major one. Doing so reduces this Charm’s cost by five motes.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by using [[Impervious Primacy Mantle]] to defend against influence, or by using [[Ego-Infused Pattern Primacy]] to defend against or mitigate a Shaping effect.
