*The Lunar slips away from her foes with a well-timed transformation.*
When the Lunar uses [[Quicksilver Second Face]] and makes a [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] roll on the same tick, characters whose [[Initiative]] is lower than hers suffer a −3 penalty on their rolls against her [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]]. Characters who weren’t aware the Lunar could shapeshift also suffer this penalty.
Penalized characters who fail their roll lose 1 [[Initiative]].

## Protean 
Shifting into a shape with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] lets the Lunar roll [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] to enter concealment without needing a hiding place.
