*Exerting herself beyond the limits of what mortal flesh can endure, the Abyssal revels in unholy strength.*
The deathknight adds ([[Essence]]) dice on a feat of [[Strength]] and adds +2 to her effective [[Strength]] rating to determine what feats she can attempt. If this raises her effective [[Strength]] over a featâ€™s minimum, each dot over adds an additional bonus die.
