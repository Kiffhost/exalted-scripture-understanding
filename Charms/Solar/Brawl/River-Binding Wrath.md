*The Exalt leaps through her anima like a burning apparition of glorious anger, capturing a foe in her iron grasp.*
For two motes, this Charm enhances a grapple attempt or the control roll, allowing the Solar to reroll 5s and 6s until 5s and 6s fail to appear. For four motes, it enhances both rolls.
