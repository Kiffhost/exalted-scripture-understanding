*Dreaming Wisdom Revelation The Lunar offers her patronage to those who worship at her shrine in the wilderness, blessing them with secret rites of otherworldly power.*
The Lunar creates a shrine, monument, cairn, or similar site in a place that’s close to a community, but set apart from it — a forest bordering a village, a mountain peak that looms above a mining town, First Age ruins beneath a city, etc. This requires at least a major [[Craft]] project (Exalted, p. 240). As part of this project, the Lunar must spread word of her shrine among the community, teaching them the rites that must be performed there.
Once the Lunar completes her shrine, the community’s people may invoke her favor and protection by performing the shrine’s rites.
The shrine’s rites can take many forms, but always require a community member to travel to the shrine no less than once a year at Calibration. The Lunar also imposes additional requirements whose severity depends on how much of the community must be involved to meet them. If a majority of its populace is required, their obligation need only be an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216), like observing a dietary restriction or praying to the Lunar. If a smaller group is necessary, it must be at least a serious task, like making lavish offerings of animal sacrifices. If only the person who travels to the shrine is necessary, it must be a life-changing task, like killing a lion alone and bringing its carcass to the shrine.
As long as the rites are performed, the community gains the following benefits. They extend out to ([[Essence]] x10) miles from the center of the community proper.
 - The Lunar can hear any prayers made to her from the shrine. If she knows [[Fleeting Silver Mirage]] (Lunars, p. 295), she can use it in response to a prayer to appear at the shrine.
 - The community is warded against the encroachment of the Wyld, shadowlands, and similar forms of corruption. This includes all environmental Shaping effects. It doesn’t undo corruption that’s already taken place.
 - Spirits and fae within the community count as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Principle]] of respect for its customs. They can’t attempt to harm community members or refuse to hear out their requests, so long as the community treats them peacefully and inoffensively. Characters whose [[Essence]] equals or exceeds the Lunar’s may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist this for a scene, or two [[Willpower]] to harm community members unprovoked.
 - If the Lunar knows Heaven-Darkening [[Eclipse]] or [[Unraveling the Tapestry]] (Lunars, p. 206), she senses whenever the community comes under that from magic that could be negated with that Charm, letting her use it from afar. If she succeeds, the solution she introduces is revealed to the community’s members by dreams, strange portents, or spiritual ecstasies.
The Lunar can only have one shrine at a time with this Charm, but shrines raised in territories claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]] (Lunars, p. 176) don’t count toward this limit.
