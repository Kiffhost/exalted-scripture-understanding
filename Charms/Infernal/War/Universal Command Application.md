*The Infernal need not speak to send her troops marching to her doom; her will is implicit in the fabric of reality.*

The Infernal makes a command action telepathically, targeting an allied battle group within long range. She ignores environmental and distance-based penalties on the roll. She can flurry it without any penalties, but can’t flurry order actions with attacks.

If the Infernal orders a battle group to attack enemy fae or rallies a battle group after it’s routed by fae or Wyld phenomena, she doubles 9s.
## [[Keys]]
#### All Are One (War 5, Essence 2) (+5m)
The Infernal can pay a five-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene. At the end of the scene, members of targeted battle groups weaken their strongest Intimacy based on individuality by one step.
#### Hollow Mind Possession (Essence 3; [[#All Are One (War 5, Essence 2) (+5m)|All Are One]]) (1wp)
While using [[#All Are One (War 5, Essence 2) (+5m)|All Are One]], the Infernal can pay one Willpower to enhance an order action. In addition to its usual effects, the targeted battle group adds attack roll extra successes equal to the Infernal’s total successes as dice of damage, to a minimum of (Infernal’s Essence) extra damage dice. Against fae enemies, it converts up to (Infernal’s Essence) added dice to automatic successes.
