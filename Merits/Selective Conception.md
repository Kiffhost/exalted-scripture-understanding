The character enjoys full conscious control over his or her fertility, never running the risk of unwanted pregnancy. Perhaps this is the result of years of cultivated control of body and [[Essence]], a divine blessing, or simply the benefit of lucky birth. Both sexes may withhold fertility when they wish. Female characters may pay one [[Willpower]] to ensure conception, and will automatically know when theyâ€™re pregnant; male characters do not gain this benefit.
