Donning the fate of an apex predator as if it were a pelt, the Sidereal menaces her foes. On each of her turns, the Sidereal may reflexively make an influence roll to threaten enemies or instill Ties of fear toward herself. Enemies who already have such Ties suffer a –(Intimacy) penalty on attack rolls or threaten rolls against her unless they pay one Willpower and (Sidereal’s Essence, maximum 5) Initiative to resist. While at bonfire anima, the Sidereal may replace her iconic display with a great bear, potentially concealing her identity from those familiar with her anima.
