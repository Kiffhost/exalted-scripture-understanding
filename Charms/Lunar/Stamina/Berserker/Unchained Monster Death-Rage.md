*As the Lunar is struck a fatal blow, the rage that burns in her overflows in a monstrous howl.*
She will not die, not until she’s slaked her wrath with sweet vengeance. If she’s incapacitated while [[Relentless Lunar Fury]] is active, she enters a final fury, postponing incapacitation and rendering her immune to further decisive damage. She gains +2 base [[Initiative]], gains one [[Initiative]] at the start of each turn, and adds her current [[Initiative]] to her natural soak. 
The death-rage ends if the Lunar is crashed and can’t raise her [[Initiative]] above 0 before resetting to base [[Initiative]] after three rounds, or when [[Relentless Lunar Fury]] ends. If her Incapacitated level is still filled with damage, she’s incapacitated normally.
