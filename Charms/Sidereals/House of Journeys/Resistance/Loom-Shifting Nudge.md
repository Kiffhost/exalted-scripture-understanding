*The weave of fate itself strains as the Sidereal performs feats of impossible might, wrestling behemoths and kicking down towers.*
The Sidereal can grapple a Legendary Size foe or forcibly move it with an attack or similar effect. She waives the Willpower cost to reduce the target number of rolls to do so with any Ability.
Alternatively, the Sidereal can undertake a feat of strength to lift or otherwise move an object that would normally be impossible given her size and leverage, as though her grip’s leverage extended one range band further than usual. This can’t enhance feats of demolition.
With Essence 5, every five extra successes on a feat of strength extend its scale by one range band, maximum +4.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used on a feat of strength once per day unless reset by fulfilling an auspicious prospect with a feat of strength or a similar act of physical exertion.
