*With slick presentation and a silver tongue, the Lunar passes off placebos as cure-alls and harmless herbs as poison.*
The Lunar can use [[Trash-is-Treasure Misdirection]] to convince someone that a given substance possesses a fictitious quality, beneficial or harmful, making an instill roll instead of a bargain roll. She might claim that silver burns the skin of the truly virtuous, or that bear meat is deadly unless prepared by a chef of legendary skill. She can’t choose a substance that’s so common that avoiding exposure is nigh-impossible, like air, or that’s necessary for someone’s survival, like water. A narrower subset, like “the air inside the satrap’s manse” or “water from this river” is permissible.
Success causes the Lunar’s victim to believe her lie so deeply that the substance is truly beneficial or harmful to him: Beneficial: When ingested, the substance counts as exceptional equipment for him on rolls appropriate to the Lunar’s claims for one scene, adding a non-Charm bonus die. This doesn’t enhance attacks, [[Shape Sorcery]] rolls, or similar offensive actions. Other characters’ rolls can also gain this bonus if the quality benefits their action, like a [[Medicine]] roll to treat him with an alleged panacea.
Harmful: The substance is poisonous to the victim, with Damage 2B/hour, duration ([[Essence]] x2) hours, a −2 penalty, and a vector of either touch, inhalation, or ingestion.
Doses of this poison don’t stack — he can’t suffer a new one until the existing dose leaves his system. The effects of the poisoning have at least a convincing resemblance to the effects of whatever harm the Lunar described.
Unlike with Trash-and-Treasure Misdirection’s usual effect, this Psyche effect lasts until the target encounters evidence that refutes the Lunar’s claim and spends three [[Willpower]] to resist.
