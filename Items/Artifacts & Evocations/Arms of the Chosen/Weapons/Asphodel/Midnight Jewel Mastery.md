This Evocation reduces the cost of the following Charms by two motes, and enhances them as described below: 
- Undead drawn out using Burning Exorcism Technique (Exalted, p. 356) can be sent into the jewel as per Shadow-World Snare instead of being held in the Solar’s anima. These do not count against her maximum number of captured spirits. 
- If the Exalt cages an undead spirit with SpiritCaging Mandala (Exalted, p. 357), she may employ Shadow-World Snare against it at range, adding threshold successes on the binding roll to the gambit attack roll. 
- Immaterial undead bargained for with Asphodel’s power can be projected into a target using Soul Projection Method (Exalted, p. 358).
