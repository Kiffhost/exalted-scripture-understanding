Might is an uncommon trait in the Age of Sorrows, measuring the supernatural power of a [[Battle Group]]. A battle group only possesses might if the average member composing it is supernaturally powerful in some martially relevant fashion. As a result, the overwhelming majority of battle groups have [[Might]] 0; very few battle groups with [[Might]] above 2 have been fielded since the founding of the Realm. [[Might]] goes from 0 to 3, and adds to the [[Accuracy]], [[Attack#raw damage|damage]], and [[Defense]] of a unit.
# [[Might]] 0
The [[Might]] rating of battle groups primarily composed of ordinary mortals. This rating has no effect on the battle group’s traits. 
# [[Might]] 1
[[Might]] 1 bestows a +1 bonus to [[Accuracy]] and [[Attack#raw damage|damage]] and a +1 bonus to [[Defense]]. 

The [[Might]] rating of battle groups lightly touched by the supernatural or whose members are slightly superhuman. This is the [[Might]] rating of groups of beastfolk and martially-enhanced Wyld mutants, or units which fight under divine blessings of a martial nature—something only very potent spirits are able to grant to battle groups above [[Size]] 2. 
# [[Might]] 2
[[Might]] 2 bestows a +2 bonus to [[Accuracy]] and [[Attack#raw damage|damage]] and a +1 bonus to [[Defense]].

The [[Might]] rating of battle groups composed primarily of supernaturally potent beings, such as lesser spirits. This is the rating of groups made up of first circle demons, war ghosts, or lesser elementals, as well as the armies of the Fair Folk. 
# [[Might]] 3
In the event that such a battle group appears, [[Might]] 3 bestows a +3 bonus to [[Accuracy]] and [[Attack#raw damage|damage]] and a +2 bonus to [[Defense]].

This is the [[Might]] rating of battle groups composed of Terrestrial Exalted or similarly potent beings. Such battle groups have rarely been seen since the First Age—in the Age of Sorrows, such beings simply don’t gather in sufficient numbers to require abstract representation, and are almost always depicted as individual heroes, even when three or more are present.
