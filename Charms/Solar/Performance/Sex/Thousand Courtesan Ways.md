The Solar suffuses her form with Essence, intensifying her every angle and motion. This Charm raises her Appearance by one for the rest of the scene, even if this increases it past five. An erotic vision made manifest, she may attempt and succeed at seductive persuade actions without targeting an Intimacy. In addition, she may make her movements and words effortlessly erotic, subtly or overtly sensualizing her social influence actions. She might be using a read intentions action to draw out someone’s opinion on a social issue while subtly enticing him with an instill action, or she might play a song to remind a prince of his homeland while using an inspire action to stir a fire in the belly of his wife. In such cases, her social influence is made with a single roll, each different action sharing the roll’s results.
