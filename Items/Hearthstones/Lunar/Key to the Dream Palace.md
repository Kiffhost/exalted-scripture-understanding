*One side of this black opal is round and smooth, the other a fantasia of minuscule turrets, domes, and spires. Everyone who’s touched the stone in the past day shares a collective dream when they sleep. Within the walls of a fabulous black opal palace, they live dream-lives of unimaginable opulence and partake in diverse decadent diversions — dressing like princes, dining like queens, engaging in courtly dalliances and intrigues, perusing otherworldly lore meaningless in the real world.* 
These dreams are experienced lucidly and recalled as clearly as waking life. The palace and its inhabitants are unaffected by dream-influencing magics less potent than Celestial or Solar Circle spells and workings.
