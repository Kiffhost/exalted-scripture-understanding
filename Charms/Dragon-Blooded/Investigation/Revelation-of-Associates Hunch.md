Criminals surround themselves with cronies, accomplices, and hirelings like a bonfire wreathes itself in cast-off embers, leaving behind a trail for an intrepid Dragon-Blood to follow. She rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10 on an Investigation roll. If she successfully uncovers evidence of crime, she experiences a sensation of flashing heat. Based on the intensity of this heat, she can gauge roughly how many individuals were involved — a lone offender’s crime barely registers as heat at all, while a conspiracy of hundreds roars like a bonfire. With an Investigation 5, Essence 3 repurchase of this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can detect that a character is connected to the crime with a successful profile character roll enhanced by Revelation-of-Associates Hunch, recognizing an all-too-familiar heat rising off of the suspect. This doesn’t reveal the role he played in the crime.
