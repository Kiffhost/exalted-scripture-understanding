None can turn the Lunar against her pack. When she asserts [[Resolve]] against influence that would make her either harm an individual she has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward or harm her Solar mate, she rolls (lower of [[Essence]] or [[Intimacy]]) dice, adding successes to her [[Resolve]] as a non-Charm bonus. Even if her [[Resolve]] is beaten, she may spend [[Willpower]] to resist without entering a Decision Point.
