*Black lightning arcs across the Infernal’s body, giving her a taste of the horror felt by the slain Primordials as she embraces their forbidden power.*

The Infernal becomes undead and can use Ivory Circle necromancy. She learns one Ivory Circle spell — her control spell — and gains one shaping ritual. However, she must be in this death-fugue to use necromancy, including workings and control effects. The transformation lasts until she uses this Charm again.
