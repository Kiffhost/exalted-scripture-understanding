Charms like Bolt of Inescapable Dread let characters roll against either Defense or a different static value. Such attacks don’t prevent their target from using defensive Charms, like subtracting attack roll successes with Fluttering Moth Defense or making a counterattack. The same is true for other effects that target the lower of two static values.
