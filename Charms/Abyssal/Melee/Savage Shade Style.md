*Honing her instinctive aptitude for murder with fatal [[Essence]], the deathknight strikes a telling blow.*
The Abyssal adds up to ([[Strength]]) dice of post-soak damage to a withering attack, or adds up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) attack roll extra successes as damage dice on a decisive attack, paying one mote per die.
