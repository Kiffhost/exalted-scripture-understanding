*Whatever compassion the Abyssal feels for the living, she does not permit it to impede her.*
The Abyssal gains +2 [[Resolve]] against influence that would weaken a negative [[Intimacy]]. This doesn’t protect Ties to the deathknight’s Lunar mate; her heart is not so easily hardened against him.
This Charm’s cost is waived when used to protect Ties toward mortals. With [[Integrity]] 5, it’s waived for Ties toward any of the living.
