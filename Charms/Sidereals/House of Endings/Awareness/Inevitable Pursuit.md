*The Sidereal senses the subtle impressions left by her quarry on the fates of everything around him, tracing his past back to him.*
The Sidereal makes a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) tracking roll, ignoring penalties from the age or condition of the tracks she follows. She can track characters even if there is no physical trace of their passage whatsoever, so long as the trail is no more than ([[Essence]]) weeks old. In sparsely populated areas, where there are fewer people to leave their mark on fate, this increases to ([[Essence]]) months. This can contest [[Traceless Passage]] (Exalted, p. 412) and similar magic.
