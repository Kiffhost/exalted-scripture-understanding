To look directly at the sun is to dare beyond daring. The second Evocation of Brilliant Sentinel may be activated the moment a new round starts, regardless of the Solar’s position in the Initiative order, so long as three anima levels have been stored with the prerequisite. The Solar releases all three levels of anima as a blinding flash that reaches all enemies within three range bands in front of the Lawgiver. This a difficulty 3 gambit that rolls Charisma + Presence against the Wits + Resistance of all targets. It also adds the wearer’s Essence to the Initiative roll, and carries one automatic success against any cursed or blighted creature of the night that gets caught in the blast, as well as any character who has threatened or done harm to one of the Solar’s Major or Defining Intimacies. If the gambit is successful, the target fails to shield his eyes and his vision is hampered for two rounds, taking a -3 penalty to any action that requires sight. This penalty also applies to the target’s combat order if done at the start of a round—treat their Initiative value as being five less than it really is, though it doesn’t actually change. This effect only lasts one round. Trivial opponents and unExalted wraiths, demons, and other creatures of darkness whose turns are driven to tick zero or lower lose their turns entirely for this round. Using this Charm does not count as the Solar’s action. Characters already penalized by this power cannot be affected by it again until the penalty has worn off.
