There are no good choices for those caught in the Siderealâ€™s grasp, only those that hurt the least. When the Sidereal makes a grapple gambit, before the attack roll, her opponent must choose one: either he suffers +1 target number on his grapple control roll or suffers dice of bashing damage equal to her attack roll 10s, ignoring [[Hardness]].
