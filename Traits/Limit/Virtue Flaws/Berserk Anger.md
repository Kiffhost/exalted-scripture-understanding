The Solar rampages out of control, attacking and killing anything he sees. His killing spree begins with his enemies, but then turns to any innocent or uninvolved bystanders of the fight. He may spare characters he has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards from his rampage, but this protection vanishes if they try to impede him in any way.
[[Berserk Anger]] can be ended prematurely if the Solar runs out of valid victims to kill, or if he incapacitates someone he has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward.
