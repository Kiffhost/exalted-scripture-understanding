Movingwithinescapablespeed,thewielderdescendslike a storm of ice to fall on her prey. To use this Evocation, the wielder must be at Initiative 10+ and succeed on a rush. She makes a reflexive decisive attack against the rushed character, using her threshold successes on the rush roll in place of her attack roll. If this incapacitates her enemy, she may reflexively roll to rush another opponent in range. This Evocation doesn’t count as the wielder’s combat action for her turn. 

## Resonant

The wielder also adds her threshold successes on the rush roll to the damage of the decisive attack.
