These small ships are built for one thing and one thing alone: speed. Sporting masts disproportionate to their hulls and operated by small, five-man crews, they are used to deliver priority messages or vitally important passengers; they have room for little else, and canâ€™t mount catapults or ballistae on deck. Pirates sometimes use them as scout ships.
# Role
Military, diplomatic, or civilian courier; pirate scout vessel; fast-attack craft
# Cargo
Virtually none. Provisions are cold or precooked, while sleepers must strap themselves into small cots.
