*Those who would understand the Abyssal risk uncovering terrifying truths.*
When a character rolls against the Abyssal’s [[Guile]], his 1s subtract successes from the roll. If he fails, he’s [[Instill|instilled]] with the Abyssal’s choice of a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward her or a [[Intimacy|Principle]] related to despair or death.
For the rest of the scene, he suffers a –([[Intimacy]]) penalty on all rolls against her.
With [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal gains any [[Willpower]] her target spends to resist this influence.
