*The oud puts orchestras to shame and rivals thunderstorms for volume.*
The oud’s music can be heard out to ([[Essence]] + [[Manipulation]]) range bands for an influence roll or an extended performance like [[Suspicion-Silencing Tune]].
She ignores penalties from distance, loud noises, or similar environmental factors.
The oud’s song can be heard even through magical silence. The musician rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Performance]]) against the effect’s difficulty, or an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll by the effect’s user. Once she succeeds, she doesn’t need to roll again for the rest of that effect’s duration.
## Resonant
The musician may pay a one-mote surcharge to extend this Evocation’s duration to one scene.
