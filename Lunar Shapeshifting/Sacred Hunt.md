A Lunar begins with her own human shape and spirit shape, and any forms granted by the Heart’s Blood and [[Stolen Faces]] [[Merits]] (p. XX). Gaining new forms requires a sacred hunt.

The hunt begins when the Lunar’s player declares her intention to take a specific quarry’s shape. She must then hunt and kill her prey. There’s no minimum time she must spend hunting, but she must declare her intention beforehand — she can’t declare a sacred hunt mid-combat. Others may assist her, but she must kill her prey herself, either directly or through traps, poison, etc. She then claims her prey’s shape by drinking its heart’s blood — the blood that flows through its heart, or the nearest analogue. 

When a Lunar claims a human’s shape, she must form a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward him if she doesn’t have one already. She doesn’t need to keep this [[Intimacy|Tie]] to retain his shape, but claiming human forms isn’t done lightly or without emotional consequences. 

The Storyteller can choose to skip combat (Exalted, p. 212), and should do so when a Lunar hunts prey that can’t offer meaningful resistance. Likewise, the Storyteller may let a Lunar perform sacred hunts over downtime to claim new forms that pose no obstacle to her.

Some [[Charms]] grant alternative sacred hunts. These have different requirements for claiming forms, although all require a declaration of intent beforehand
