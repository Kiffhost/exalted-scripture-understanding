*Long ago, the Ancient called Gaia brought forth the animal avatars, choosing a beast of each kind to receive her boon. Reciting the first five syllables of the blessing Gaia spoke upon them, the sorcerer calls upon one of these primeval spirits.* 

The sorcerer beckons one of the animal avatars with a ritual tailored to its desires. Bear Avatar answers to offerings of berries, salmon, and honey, while Thousand Thunders Belrane, the River Dragon Avatar, craves blood spilled in fresh water. The ritual takes at least four hours, regardless of the avatar summoned. 

Once the ritual is completed, the animal avatar materializes before the sorcerer. Unlike summoning other spirits with [[Templates/sorcery]], the sorcerer can’t bind the avatar, requiring her to use the normal social influence rules. (Traits for animal avatars are discussed below). Both the sorcerer and the avatar gain a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of “I must bargain in good faith” for the duration of the interaction. Sorcerers typically use this spell to request boons or favors of the summoned avatar with persuade or bargain actions, though they aren’t limited to these forms of influence. Most avatars begin their interaction with a sorcerer by using Eye of the Animal Avatar (p. 87) to assess her treatment of their animals. 

The following boons are commonly requested of the avatars. They include the level of task (Exalted, p. 216) they represent by default for someone the avatar deems worthy: 
 - Service: The avatar performs a single task for the sorcerer, which often involves invoking the aid of nearby animals using its [[Charms]]. The task’s severity is typically adjudicated as usual, but it’s always at least serious if it requires the avatar to command large numbers of animals or risks harming any of them. 
 - Battle Groups: The avatar can [[Rally]] a battle group of nearby animals to fight for the sorcerer or someone else in a single battle. The severity of the task depends on the animal’s [[Familiar]] rating and the battle group’s [[Size]]. As a serious task, an avatar will raise a [[Size]] 1-4 group of one-dot familiars, a [[Size]] 1-3 group of two-dot familiars, or a [[Size]] 1 group of three-dot familiars. A life-changing task provides a [[Size]] 5 group of one-dot familiars, a [[Size]] 4 group of two-dot familiars, or a [[Size]] 2 group of three-dot familiars. The battle group has average [[Drill]], or elite [[Drill]] if it’s made up of pack hunters. 
 - [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]]: The avatar will teach one of his [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]] to someone capable of learning them as an inconvenient task. 
 - [[Familiar]]: The avatar will summon a nearby animal to serve the sorcerer or someone else as a serious task. 
 - [[Influence]]: Some animal avatars possess considerable cachet among Creation’s and Heaven’s spirit courts, and a few dwell in the heavenly city of Yu-Shan. They can make introductions on the sorcerer’s behalf to grant her up to three-dot [[Influence]] (Exalted, p. 162) with a group of spirits that the avatar holds sway with. Conferring onedot [[Influence]] is an inconvenient task; two-dot [[Influence]] is serious; and three-dot [[Influence]] is life-changing. The avatar and sorcerer may engage in lengthy negotiations, exchanging influence actions until one of them wishes to end the interaction. If they reach an agreement, each of them is bound to it. 
 
The animal avatar gains a Major [[Intimacy|Principle]] embodying his commitment to the agreement, which can’t be weakened or altered by any means. The sorcerer gains no [[Intimacy]], but if she breaks her agreement, she suffers as if she’d violated an [[Eclipse]] oath (Exalted, p. 176). Her divine punishment is carried out through avatar’s animals: her horse throws her from the saddle in a life-or-death situation; rabid dogs spread disease through her city; ants swarm her in life-threatening numbers. 

If the sorcerer can’t reach a deal with the avatar, the avatar may choose to vanish back whence he came. He can also do so if endangered or greatly offended. 

# Control
Instead of summoning an animal avatar, the sorcerer may cast this spell to ensure that a prayer she makes to an animal avatar will be noticed. She can’t convey social influence through such prayers. Doing so costs only one [[Willpower]], and the ritual takes only a few minutes.

# Designing Animal Avatars
Animal avatars are spirits. They’re material by nature, like elementals. All of them can dematerialize, using the same rules as materializing (Exalted, p. 510), but in reverse. If slain, they reform at the next full moon.
**Essence:** Animal avatars typically have [[Essence]] 5 to 7. They have ({Essence x10} + 50) motes. **Willpower:** Animal avatars typically have 7-10 [[Willpower]]. 
**Health:** An avatar uses one of three health tracks, depending on his animal’s size: 
 - By default, the track is −0x5/−1x10/−2x10/−4x5/ Incap. 
 - If his animal has Minuscule [[Size]] or Tiny Creature, the track is −0x10/−1x10/−2x4/−4/Incap. 
 - If his animal has Legendary [[Size]], the track is −0/−1x10/−2x10/−4x15/Incap. 
**Dice Pools:** Avatars have pools of 11+ dice in the one or two areas that they’re best at, 8-10 dice in areas they’re well-suited to, and 3-7 dice in other areas. (You can pick the same value for all of the pools in each category to streamline the process.) These typically include any dice pools possessed by their animal, which are usually in the first or second groups. 
**Defenses:** Avatars typically have at least one of [[Defense|Evasion]] or [[Defense|Parry]] at 6-7, favoring whichever of the two their animal does. 
**Social Traits:** Avatars’ [[Resolve]] is typically 4-6, while [[Guile]] can be anywhere from 1-6. Their [[Appearance]] is usually the same or one higher than their animal’s. 
**Attacks:** Avatars have all natural attacks possessed by their animal. The avatar has a dice pool of 12+ dice for whichever of the animal’s attacks has the highest dice pool and 9-11 dice for other attacks. Whichever of the animal’s attacks has the highest damage has Damage 17- 22 and Overwhelming 4-5. Other attacks have Damage 14-19 and Overwhelming 1-4. Grapple control roll pools usually follow their animal’s size: 3-7 dice for animals with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]]; 8-10 dice for default size animals; and 11+ dice for Legendary [[Size]] animals. 
**Soak and [[Hardness]]:** Avatars typically have 10-15 soak and [[Hardness]] 0-10. They almost always exceed their animal’s own soak and [[Hardness]]. 
**[[Intimacy|Intimacies]]:** Avatars default to having a positive Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward their animal and a negative Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards those who mistreat their animal. Many have a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] reflecting pride, dignity, or self-respect, for they are peers to gods and the Exalted. Common topics for other Ties include friends and enemies, the avatar’s cult, other spirits, Gaia, cultures with significant interactions with the avatar’s animal, and their animal’s native environment and main predators. Common Principles include motivations, agendas, ethical tenets, philosophical stances, and personal idiosyncrasies. 
**Special Abilities and [[Merits]]:** Avatars typically have any special abilities and [[Merits]] their animal has, including latent and magical abilities. If their animal doesn’t have existing Quick Character traits, they can use appropriate special abilities and [[Merits]] from other animals instead. Avatars often have the [[Cult]] Merit at two to four dots (Exalted, p. 160). 
## [[Charms]]
Animal avatars can have any spirit [[Charms]] appropriate to the animal they represent and its mythic resonance, as well as the following unique [[Charms]]. 
### Behemoth-Beast Expansion
(10m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; [[Essence]] 5): The avatar can grow as large as Legendary [[Size]] or shrink down as far as his animal’s size, gaining or losing the Legendary [[Size]], Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] [[Merits]] as appropriate (Lunars, pp. 179, 265, 362). 
### Eye of the Animal Avatar 
(5m; Simple; Instant; [[Essence]] 1; [[Eclipse]]): The avatar makes a special [[Read Intentions]] roll against someone to learn how she’s treated his animals. [[Eclipse]] Castes roll ([[Perception]] + [[Survival]]). The avatar forms a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her based on what he learns. 
### Fealty of the Flock
(1m, 1wp or 5m, 1wp or 10m, 1wp; Reflexive; One day; [[Essence]] 3; [[Eclipse]]): The avatar’s animals count as having a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of respectful obedience toward him. The [[Intimacy]] is only Major for animals that are domesticated or tamed, or Minor for familiars and other magically empowered animals. This costs one mote, one [[Willpower]] if the animal is a one-dot [[Familiar]] (Exalted, p. 161), five motes, one [[Willpower]] for two-dot Familiars, or ten motes, one [[Willpower]] for three-dot Familiars. 
### Primeval Exemplar
(1m per die or 2m per +1 bonus; Reflexive; Instant; [[Essence]] 4): The animal avatar can use this Charm for one to three areas of competence, comparable to a specialty, that reflect his animal’s strengths or mythic resonance. This might be grappling for Bear Avatar, stealth in darkness for Bat Avatar, or ancient wisdom for Salmon Avatar. The avatar can add dice to rolls for one mote each, maximum +10, or increase static values for two motes per +1 bonus, maximum +5. 
### Thousand Beast Labors
(30m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; [[Essence]] 5; [[Eclipse]]): The avatar rolls [[Social Influence]] as a special persuade roll to issue a command to its animals. [[Eclipse]] Castes roll ([[Charisma]] + [[Survival]]). This influence automatically succeeds against all such animals within a number of miles equal to the avatar’s successes, except for those that are domesticated, tamed, or magically empowered. The effects of this are generally narrative rather than mechanical, limited only by the animals’ number and capabilities. Nontrivial enemies affected by it can always use an appropriate opposed roll or static value to resist. Once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal that benefits the avatar’s animal or when summoned by a sorcerer the avatar deems worthy of his service. 
### Unwavering Guardian
(Permanent; [[Essence]] 5): The avatar may reject as unacceptable any influence that would weaken a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] to his animal or cause him to neglect or harm his animal.
