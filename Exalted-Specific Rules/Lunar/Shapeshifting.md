The Lunars are peerless shapeshifters, clothing themselves in the skins of fierce beasts or stolen faces. Their protean power evinces their predatory nature; before a Lunar can take a shape, she must claim it with a [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Lunar/Sacred Hunt]]. 

A Lunar may enter an animal or human shape she possesses as a miscellaneous action, committing four motes for the transformation’s duration. This can be flurried, but not with attack actions. She may reflexively revert back to her true human form by releasing this commitment. 

Note that some Lunar [[Charms]] refine or expand on the default shapeshifting powers presented here.

# Animal Shapes

The Lunar’s [[Essence]], [[Willpower]], base [[Initiative]], health levels, Attributes, Abilities, specialties, [[Resolve]], and [[Guile]] are unaffected. 
- She loses any mutations she possesses intrinsically (but not those granted by magic), except for mutations tied to her [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Lunar/Tell]]. 
- When she takes an action for which the animal has a listed dice pool, she may use that pool. Any dice over her base (Attribute + Ability + specialty) count as Charm dice, potentially preventing her from using a form’s full dice pool. If the animal’s pool is lower than hers, or it has no listed pool, she uses her own pool, although the Storyteller may assess penalties if her shape is ill-suited to that action. 
- She uses the animal’s natural weapons, including their listed dice pool and damage value. (Note that she uses the same pool for withering and decisive attacks). Any dice over her Brawlbased pool count as Charm dice, but damage doesn’t count against the amount she may add with the [[Strength]] Excellency. If her [[Brawl]] pool is higher than a natural weapon’s attack pool, she uses it, and her withering attack rolls gain +1 [[Accuracy]]. 
- She may attempt feats of strength that the animal is capable of performing. If its listed [[Strength]] rating is lower than hers, she’s limited to the lower value. If it doesn’t list a [[Strength]] rating for feats of strength, it’s assumed to have [[Strength]] 1. 
- She may use the animal’s [[Defense|Evasion]] and [[Defense|Parry]] instead of her own. Any amount over her own base values counts as a Charm bonus. 
- She may use the animal’s natural soak and [[Hardness]] instead of her own. This doesn’t count against the maximum soak she can add with the [[Stamina]] Excellency. 
- She gains the animal’s innate special abilities and [[Merits]]. Dice or successes added by these count as Charm bonuses. 
- She may unlock an animal shape’s mundane latent abilities (but not magical abilities) for six experience points or three bonus points each. Once she’s unlocked a latent ability for one form, it’s unlocked for all forms capable of using it. She doesn’t need to unlock latent abilities to use distract, disarm, and unhorse gambits. 
- Her ability to communicate is limited by the animal’s anatomy. Most can’t speak human languages, forcing her to use body language (Exalted, p. 221).

Changing into animal shapes with Legendary [[Size]] or Minuscule [[Size]] requires [[Towering Beast Form]] or [[Emerald Grasshopper Form]], respectively. A Lunar lacking these [[Charms]] can still claim such animals’ shapes or choose one as her spirit shape but must learn the appropriate Charm before she can turn into such forms.

# Human Shapes

A Lunar who takes on a human’s shape can’t be distinguished from him unless her [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Lunar/Tell]] is spotted or magic like [[Eye of the Unconquered Sun]] (Exalted, p. 273) is used against her. Taking human forms doesn’t alter her traits. A wandering strongman’s muscular form is still dependent on her own [[Strength]]; a beautiful noble’s form is less advantageous if she lacks the poise and self-confidence represented by a high [[Appearance]]. She doesn’t gain her prey’s knowledge, memories, or magic.

In human forms other than her own, the Lunar loses any mutations she possesses intrinsically (but not those granted by magic), except for mutations tied to her [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Lunar/Tell]].

# [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Lunar/Shapeshifting]] Complications

## Equipment
When a Lunar enters animal form, any items she’s wielding, wearing, or carrying that she can’t use in that shape vanish Elsewhere. This includes almost all artifacts, although moonsilver armor reshapes itself to accommodate any form the Lunar takes, and some other artifacts possess comparable powers. Banished items return once the Lunar takes a shape that’s compatible with them.

## [[Martial Arts]] 
[[Martial Arts]] are incompatible with animal shapes. Lunars in animal forms can’t use [[Martial Arts]] to attack or parry or activate [[Martial Arts]] [[Charms]]. Any [[Martial Arts]] [[Charms]] active when they enter an animal shape end. 

## Damage and Debilities 
Changing shapes doesn’t heal damage or undo crippling injuries, diseases, poisons, shaping effects, etc. A Lunar who loses an arm in one form will lack it in any shape she enters. 

## [[Size]] and Space 
Changing shapes requires adequate space to complete the transformation. If a Lunar is confined to a space that can’t accommodate the shape she wishes to take, she must flurry her shapeshifting action with a feat of demolition to create the necessary room. If unsuccessful, she can’t shapeshift. 

If a Lunar finds herself inside a character, she can’t change into a shape larger than he is or otherwise harm him by shapeshifting inside him (though she can attack from within).
