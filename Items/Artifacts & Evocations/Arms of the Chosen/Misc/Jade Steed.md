This green jade statue is a life-sized representation of a horse, perfect in every detail. Attuned for four motes, it comes to life as an animated jade steed that needs neither food, water, air, nor sleep, and knows no fear. The steed has near-human intelligence and can understand and follow spoken commands. It has a horseâ€™s traits (Exalted, p. 567), but with 11 soak, Hardness 7, and its attacks have Overwhelming 3. Weighing nearly a ton, it sinks in water like a stone; wooden planks can rupture beneath its tread. 

Clockwork mounts, their moonsilver springs and gears concealed beneath orichalcum plates, have been found in First Age ruins. These are functionally identical to their jade counterparts
