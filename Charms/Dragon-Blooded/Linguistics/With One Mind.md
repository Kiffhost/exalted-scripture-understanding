The Dragon-Blood weaves her mind together with that of her allies, creating a shared battle-consciousness that transcends language’s limitations. She forms a mental bond with either a single character she can see, or all of her Sworn Kin she can see. Participants in the bond gain the following benefits: 
- They can communicate telepathically with each other. This isn’t limited by range or line of sight, but they must share a common language. 
- As long as one of them is aware of a hidden threat or concealed character, all of them are. This may render them immune to unexpected attacks (Exalted, p. 203) or allow them to attack a concealed enemy. 
- Whenever one of them is attacked, another bonded character within close range may reflexively interpose his [[Defense|Parry]], as though with a defend other action. Only one character may make this reflexive defense against a single attack, even if several are in range. 
- If a participant attempts a distract gambit (Exalted, p. 200) against an enemy to benefit another bonded character, the beneficiary doubles 7s on the attack roll. A successful gambit grants the beneficiary one point of [[Initiative]] in addition to those spent by the attacker. Lore
