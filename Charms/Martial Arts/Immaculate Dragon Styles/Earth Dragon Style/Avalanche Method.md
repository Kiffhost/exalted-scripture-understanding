*Striking blow after hammering blow, the Immaculate forces even the haughtiest heretics to kneel.*
To use this Charm, the Immaculate must have [[Initiative]] 12+ and her target must have a mobility penalty of at least −1. She makes decisive attacks against a single enemy until she’s made a total equal to his mobility penalty, or until she misses. A successful attack doesn’t reset her to base [[Initiative]] — instead, she loses [[Initiative]] equal to the successes on her damage roll, to a minimum of her base [[Initiative]]. Once she’s completed all attacks, she resets as usual. 
If the Immaculate successfully lands a smash attack against an enemy, he isn’t knocked back until she’s completed all attacks made with this Charm. Landing multiple smash attacks lets her fling him back multiple range bands, to a maximum of long range. He crashes to earth with incredible force, suffering damage as per a short-range fall if he’s knocked to medium range, or per a medium-range fall if knocked to long range (Exalted, p. 232). An enemy trapped with [[Hungry Earth Strike]] isn’t dislodged from his earthen prison, but still suffers falling damage as he’s ground against his prison’s stone walls with bone-breaking force. 
In Earth Aura, missing doesn’t prevent the Immaculate from launching further attacks.
