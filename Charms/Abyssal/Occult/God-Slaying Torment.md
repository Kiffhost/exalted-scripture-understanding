*The Abyssal delivers a gospel of annihilation to those who think themselves beyond death.*
The Abyssal’s decisive attack deals aggravated damage to a spirit, and destroys it permanently if it incapacitates him.
If the Abyssal uses God-Slaying Torment with an Archery, Brawl, Martial Arts, Melee, or Thrown Charm that steals motes, she reduces that Charm’s cost by two Initiative and steals an additional mote. This increases to (spirit’s Essence) additional motes if she destroys it.
These don’t count toward the maximum motes those Charms can steal.
