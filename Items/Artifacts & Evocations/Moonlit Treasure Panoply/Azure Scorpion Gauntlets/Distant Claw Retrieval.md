Reaching out with the gauntlet’s blades, the wielder extends her grasp.
On the wielder’s turn, she can reflexively fire the gauntlet’s blades at an unattended object within medium range to retrieve it. It must be light enough that she could carry it.
She rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Thrown]]) at difficulty 2 to retrieve it.
If there are any enemies within close range of the object, the wielder must beat their Parry as well, though this doesn’t count as an attack. However, the blades aren’t gentle — attempting to retrieve something fragile, like a glass ornament or map, is likely to break or damage it.
If the wielder disarms an enemy and uses this Evocation to retrieve the weapon on the same turn, she adds her extra successes on the gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll as nonCharm dice on this Evocation’s roll.
## Resonant
The wielder gains one [[Initiative]] if retrieving an object provides an advantage in combat or deprives her enemies of one.
## Dissonant
The object doesn’t reach the wielder until the start of her next turn.
