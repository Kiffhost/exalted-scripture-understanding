Characters can normally take only a single combat action per turn, unless they take a [[Flurry]] and receive only one turn per round.
# Attack
The goal of combat is to damage your opponent's [[Health Track]]. This is achieved using [[#decisive]] attacks, which spend [[Initiative]]. [[#Withering]] attacks lower your opponent's initiative while increasing your own, but usually do not affect Health Track. 
## withering
1. First, decide which #Ability/combat is appropriate for the attack (this is often determined by the weapon being used)
 2. Make a [[#hit roll]] with a [[Dice Rolls#Dice Pool|pool]] of (Dexterity + #Ability/combat + [[Accuracy]] (of the weapon) + other [[Dice Rolls#Modifiers|modifiers]]) against a [[Dice Rolls#Difficulty|difficulty]] of the target's [[Combat Traits#Defense|Defense]].
	 - If the hit roll succeeds, the attacker gains 1 [[Initiative]] and continues.
	 - If the hit roll fails, the action ends.
 3. Determine the [[#raw damage]], usually (Strength + Damage (of the weapon) + [[Dice Rolls#Threshold Successes|threshold successes]] from the hit roll).
 4. Make a [[#damage roll]] with a pool of (raw damage - target's [[Soak]]) to a minimum of the weapon's [[Overwhelm]]. This roll *[[Dice Rolls#Doubling|Doubles 10s]]* as normal.
 5. Count the [[Dice Rolls#Successes|successes]] on the damage roll, subtract this number from the target's [[Initiative]] and add it to your character's [[Initiative]].
## decisive
 1. First, decide which #Ability/combat is appropriate for the attack (this is often determined by the weapon being used)
 2. Make a [[#hit roll]] with a [[Dice Rolls#Dice Pool|pool]] of (Dexterity + #Ability/combat + other [[Dice Rolls#Modifiers|modifiers]]) against a [[Dice Rolls#Difficulty|difficulty]] of the target's [[Defense]]. (Note that this roll **does not include weapon [[Accuracy]]**)
	 - If the hit roll succeeds, continue.
	 - If the hit roll fails, and your [[Initiative]] is 1-10, lose 2; if it is 11+, lose 3. The action ends.
3. Make a [[#damage roll]] with a pool equal to your current initiative. ***This roll does not [[Dice Rolls#Doubling|double 10s]]***.
	- Check if the target has a [[Hardness]] score greater than the [[#damage roll]] dice pool. If they do, they take no damage. This is still considered a successful attack.
4. Count the [[Dice Rolls#Successes|successes]]  of the damage roll and apply that many levels of damage to the target's [[Health Track]]. This damage will be [[Health Track#Bashing|bashing]] or [[Health Track#Lethal|lethal]] according to the weapon used.
5. Reset your character's initiative to [[Initiative#Base value|base value]] (3 by default).

# Glossary
## raw damage
The dice pool of a [[#withering]] [[#damage roll]] before [[Soak]] is applied.
## hit roll
The first roll made in any [[#Attack]], determines whether the defender can evade or parry the attack before it causes harm. Usually has a [[Dice Rolls#Dice Pool|dice pool]] of at least the attacker's (Dexterity + #Ability/combat) and a [[Dice Rolls#Difficulty|difficulty]] equal to the defender's [[Defense]].  
## damage roll
The second roll in an [[#Attack]], after the [[#hit roll]]. Used to determine the amount of damage dealt.
