*Clinging to what little remains to define her, the Abyssal finds an unassailable truth in the worst of herself.*
The Abyssal perfectly defends against a Psyche effect, Shaping effect, or sorcerous curse by invoking one of her negative Defining Intimacies. She can commit this Charm’s cost indefinitely to become immune to that kind of effect for as long as she keeps that [[Intimacy]] at Defining intensity. Defending against a Shaping effect only grants immunity to other Shaping effects that change the same aspect of the Abyssal — resisting a physical transformation won’t help her against spiritual mutilation.
If the Abyssal invokes a Principle protected [[Eternal Enmity Approach]], she must give up its protection for this Charm’s duration.
With [[Essence]] 5, this Charm’s cost is reduced by three motes.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal can invoke her [[Whispers]] instead of an [[Intimacy]]. If she extends this Charm’s duration, she can’t invoke her [[Whispers]] again until it ends.
## Reset 
Once the Abyssal ends this Charm, she can’t use it again until she’s spent a scene acting in accordance with a Defining [[Intimacy]] she intends to use it through.
