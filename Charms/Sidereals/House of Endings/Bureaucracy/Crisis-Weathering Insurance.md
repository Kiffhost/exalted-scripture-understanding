The Sidereal’s imprimatur holds all threats to an organization at bay, securing it against turmoil and sabotage. The Sidereal may pay a four-mote surcharge when she uses [[Corruption Elimination Agenda]] to protect the targeted organization from harm. Hostile effects that target the organization as a whole, like [[Indolent Official Charm]], suffer +1 target number. If the effect is normally unrolled, the character using it must make an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll opposing the Sidereal’s ([[Intelligence]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) roll. Additionally, when organization members make rolls opposing a threat to the group as a whole — a disease spreading through its ranks, poison vapors released in its headquarters, a campaign of sabotage, etc. — they gain −1 target number. This Charm’s benefits extend to organization members who didn’t receive the Sidereal’s message, but for very large organizations like the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] or the Guild, it applies only to that subdivision of the group that the Sidereal spread her message through.
