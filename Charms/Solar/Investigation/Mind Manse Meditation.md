*The Solar builds a palace of her memories.*
Upon using this Charm, she mentally perceives this palace as an archive of gathered evidence, research, character profiles and investigations which she can mentally traverse in order to conduct a thorough investigation. While inside her Mind [[Manse]], the Solar is entranced and unaware of her physical surroundings. She may recall anything that she knows in order to conduct her investigation forward, compiling evidence, research, and associating ideas at a rate of roughly ([[Essence]]) hours per ten seconds. During this time, the Lawgiver can access any information the Storyteller deems that she knows, based on any of her other Abilities and anything she has learned over the course of the story, in order to make psychic connections between evidence, ideas, and facts that would otherwise be impossible. The effects of this Charm are largely dramatic. Entering the Mind [[Manse]] allows the Exalt to find the solution to a riddle or mystery that allows her to forward her investigation. This Charm may be used once per story.
