*Those who think themselves above the Sidereal are those most vulnerable to her, so blinded by their hubris that they don’t notice her until it’s too late.*
The Sidereal is overlooked by characters who consider themselves her social, political, or economic superior, or believe themselves more important than her, based on their own position, their Intimacies, and the Sidereal’s appearance. Such characters can’t notice her or anything that would directly indicate her presence, like an ally’s warning.
A character can enter a Decision Point to resist this influence by citing an Intimacy of compassion, humility, or self-doubt and spending one Willpower to become immune for the scene. If a character has an Intimacy related to his feelings of self-superiority, the Intimacy he cites in the Decision Point must have equal or greater intensity.
This Charm ends if the Sidereal takes an overt action, including Joining Battle or blatantly displaying supernatural power.
