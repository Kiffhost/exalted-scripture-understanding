The Sidereal proclaims Venus’s disfavor, souring her victim’s fortunes in his social life and romantic pursuits. The Sidereal rolls ([[Charisma]] + Serenity Ability) opposing her target’s ([[Wits]] + Serenity Ability) roll. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one [[Willpower]] for others. Success curses him, inflicting misfortune on his pursuit of a social, business, or political goal chosen by the Sidereal. Once per scene, the Sidereal’s player may impose +1 target number on a influence roll, read intentions roll, or a [[Bureaucracy]] roll related to this objective. The Sidereal need not be present. Cursing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options. Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. Abstemious Monk’s Regret (The Musician): The Sidereal’s target declines an opportunity to indulge in a sensual pleasure, leisure activity, or casual social event that he enjoys. Broken Promise Punishment (The Lovers): The Sidereal’s target breaks a promise to her. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively. Faithless Rake’s Doom (The Pillar): The Sidereal’s target interferes in or tries to break up a relationship — romantic or otherwise — or ends one of his own relationships. Foolish Heart Affliction (The Peacock): The Sidereal’s target ignores advice he sought from her in matters of romance, friendship, or politics. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively. Vexatious Suitor Curse (The Ewer): The Sidereal’s target confesses his feelings to someone. The Sidereal can curse multiple characters with this Charm. Mystical Bonds Lunars’ bonds with their Solar, Abyssal, or Infernal mate count as relationships, as do Dragon-Blooded’s Sworn Kinships.
