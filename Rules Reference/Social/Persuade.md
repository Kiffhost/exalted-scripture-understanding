The persuade action allows you to convince other characters to perform an [[Action]] or task that you give to them. The extent of the action you can compel with persuade depends on the [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] of your target.

Without an [[Intimacy]] to support your [[Social Influence#Influence roll|influence roll]], you can only convince others to take relatively trivial and risk-free actions—begging a coin from a passing stranger is about the limit. On the other hand, characters who have an appropriate [[Intimacy|Tie]] or [[Intimacy|Principle]] can be convinced to undertake great risks, dedicate their lives to a cause, or even die in your name. There are three categories of tasks characters might be asked to undertake, each based on the [[Intimacy]] being exploited:
# Inconvenient Tasks
Characters who have an appropriate Minor [[Intimacy]] can be convinced to perform tasks that pose some mild danger or hindrance to them, as long as it is not severe enough to seriously disrupt their life or livelihood—the prospect of a severe injury, an angry superior, or heavy financial loss is still more than they will allow. With this level of [[Intimacy]], you can persuade people to do things that take longer than a scene to complete, if the amount of time needed is not so long as to disrupt the target’s life.

“I need you to deliver this parcel to that big house in Cinnabar District, with the red jade lion statues by the door. If the man on the door has a scorpion tattoo, don’t leave it with him—insist to see the master of the house.”

# Serious Tasks
Characters who have an appropriate Major [[Intimacy]] can be convinced to perform even tasks that carry the risk of extreme harm or impediment. At this level, a farmer could be convinced to join your personal militia despite the risk of dying on the battlefield, while an apothecary might provide you with poisons even though he faces imprisonment or corporal punishment for doing so. However, they will still balk if the risk of death or ruin is almost certain. Tasks that take extended amounts of time are possible at this level, even if they require a longterm commitment such as joining an organization.

“Just because he’s your father doesn’t make you his slave—why should his fear deny you a place in AnTeng’s glorious uprising against its oppressors? This nation needs heroes; men like you!”

# Life-changing Tasks
Characters who have a Defining [[Intimacy]] can be made to do almost anything. At this level, you could convince a devoted follower to hold off a Wyld Hunt long enough to buy time for your escape, or make a wealthy noble donate the better portion of his fortune to your personal cult. Only in cases where death or utter ruin are absolutely, unavoidably certain will they balk, and even then the Storyteller might decide they’re willing to do it despite all odds.

“I know the old scrolls said the heart of this temple is guarded by a fearsome beast of brass and flame. I know it’s frightening, but isn’t this why we came so far and spent our fortunes, to be the first ones to scavenge the Great Ziggurat of Lost Zarlath? I’ll never make it into the final chambers with my leg like this—you’ll have to dare it for both of us!”

# Retry
There are three ways to retry a failed persuade action. 
- By making a different argument, playing on a different [[Intimacy]] of equal or greater strength. 
- Wait and try again during the next story.
- Wait until the [[Intimacy]] that supported your [[Influence roll]] has been strengthened to a higher level of intensity—either by using a different social action to strengthen it, or by waiting until the character has strengthened it himself—and then try again.
