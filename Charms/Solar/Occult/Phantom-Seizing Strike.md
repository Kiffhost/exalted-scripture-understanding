The Exalt suffuses her targetâ€™s body with Solar Essence. An immaterial opponent struck by this technique becomes material for two turns. The Solar may activate this Charm after landing an attack with Spirit-Cutting Attack. So long as the damage roll generates at least one success, she may trigger this Charm.
