*The Lunar is implacable in defense of her passions.*
Upon successfully asserting [[Resolve]] against influence that opposes one of her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], she gains ([[Intimacy]]) motes. This can’t exceed the number of motes she spent enhancing her [[Resolve]]. If the opposing [[Intimacy]] is to the Lunar’s Solar mate, she treats its intensity as Defining. If it’s already Defining, she gains an additional mote.
