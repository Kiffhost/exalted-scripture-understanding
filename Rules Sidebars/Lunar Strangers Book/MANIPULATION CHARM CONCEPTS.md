Birds of Ill Feather (Essence 2; Gnawing Mouse
Malaise): Interacting with an organization lets the
Lunar insinuate herself into the company of group
members who are corrupt, disloyal, or shiftless.
Dreams-and-Nightmares Storyteller (Essence
2; Herd Subversion Approach): The Lunar tells
a story that will be spread by those who hear it.
The story counts as a custom held by those who’ve
heard it for purposes of her Lunar Charms.
Shape-Stealing Betrayal (Essence 2; Argent
Trickster’s Rook): Perform a [[sacred hunt]] that concludes when the target makes a meaningful expression or gesture of trust in the Lunar that she
doesn’t deserve.
Suspicion-Stirring Deviltry (Essence 2; Night
Sky Burial): When someone uncovers false evidence planted with Night Sky Burial, they’re compelled to spread word of their discovery and they
gain a pool of bonus dice for convincing others.
Any-Trinket Allure (Essence 3; Trash-is-Treasure Misdirection x2): The Lunar can use Trash-isTreasure Misdirection to create long-lasting illusions that affect anyone who encounters the object,
not just those present for her influence roll.
Coyote Chases Tail (Essence 3; False Burrow
Pursuit, Whispering Silver Serpent): When someone lies, the Lunar deludes him into believing his
own falsehoods, suppressing any memories that
contradict this belief. She must know that he’s lying, either from prior observation and knowledge
or Charms like Forked Tongue Discernment.
Cuckoo's Egg Recollection (Essence 3; Forgetful
Victim Technique): Implant false memories over
the course of telling a story, sharing an intimate
moment, speaking at length to a captive audience,
or the like. With Essence 4, the Lunar can do so
instantly.
Night's Own Alibi (Essence 3; Whispering Silver
Serpent): Those who believe the Lunar’s claims
must enter a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] to pursue an opportunity to investigate or follow up on her claims.
Hovel-and-Palace Equivocation (Essence 5;
Any-Trinket Allure): The Lunar can use Trash-isTreasure Misdirection on structures.
