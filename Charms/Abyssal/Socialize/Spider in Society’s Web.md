*The Abyssal’s discerning focus unravels the labyrinth of social interactions, intuiting infinite nuances from the slightest hint.*
The Abyssal rolls [[read intentions]] with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes against all characters she can perceive. Success reveals a character’s current emotional state, any Ties he has to others in the scene, and his current intentions toward others in the scene.
Failing to read a character’s intentions with this Charm doesn’t require the Abyssal to reset her [[read intentions]] before she can attempt it against him again in the same scene.
## Reset 
Once per scene, unless reset by a significant change to the scene’s context.
