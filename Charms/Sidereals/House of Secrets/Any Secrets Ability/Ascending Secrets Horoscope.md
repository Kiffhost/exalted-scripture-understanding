Under Jupiter’s auspices, the Sidereal conceals that which should be hidden and reveals that which ought be known. The Sidereal blesses another character, bestowing good fortune in keeping or discovering a certain secret. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one Willpower for others. The blessing’s effect depends on whether the Sidereal wishes to keep the secret hidden or reveal it. A blessing for keeping secrets inflicts +1 target number rolls against the character’s Guile that would reveal the secret and grants −1 target number on his Manipulation and Larceny rolls to conceal it. A blessing for revealing secrets grants −1 target number on relevant Awareness, Investigation, Lore, Occult, and read intentions rolls. Blessing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options. Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. Artless Prodigy Blessing (The Key): The Sidereal’s target shows cleverness or innovation in solving a problem, performing an experiment, or discovering new information. Counterfeit Talisman Blessing (The Guardians): The Sidereal’s target practices a superstition, hears a (supposed) prediction of his future, or seeks guidance from otherworldly forces. Mysterious Benefactor Style (The Mask): The Sidereal observes her target without him being aware of her. Obeisance-Rewarding Patronage (The Sorcerer): The Sidereal’s target expresses his respect for her intellect, knowledge, power, or authority. Wisdom of All Things (The Treasure Trove): The Sidereal’s target tells her some secret, news, or other information she didn’t already know. The Sidereal can bless multiple characters with this Charm.
