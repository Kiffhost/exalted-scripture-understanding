*Well-versed in subtle ways, the Lunar conducts her midnight works unseen.*
She flurries a [[Stealth]] roll with another action, as long as it’s not an attack or other action that would break concealment. A repurchase lets the Lunar pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to flurry a decisive attack from concealment with a [[Stealth]] roll. If the attack succeeds, she must use her reflexive movement action to enter a new place of concealment (without needing to disengage) and roll [[Stealth]]. She can’t use this effect with no hiding place to move to. If her attack misses, the [[Stealth]] roll automatically fails, but her move action isn’t consumed. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with [[Ambush]] Hunter, the Lunar ignores flurry penalties.
