*The necromancer claws and wrenches, causing the earth to fall inward into the open maw of the earth. A vortex of cold wind draws cities and armies near the opening into the darkness below, their cries swallowed by the depths.*
The necromancer creates a great sinkhole in the earth at a point within long range, which is([[Essence]]) range deep below. Out to close range around the target point, the ground immediately gives way and the howling winds draw anyone present downward. Trivial characters and battle groups caught in the collapse fall to their deaths immediately, while others must succeed on a difficulty 7 ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]]) roll or falls into the depths, suffering extreme range fall damage (Exalted, p. 232).
At the end of the round, the remaining ground on the surface out to medium range around the target point collapses inward in the same manner, exposing characters standing there to the same hazard. Even after the collapse, the mouth remains dangerous: For (necromancer’s [[Essence]]) rounds, the winds continue to howl and drag anything within close range of its edges into the depths, as above. Structures above the hollow or at its edges collapse into the depths by the round’s end, causing great destruction and potentially burying any who survive the fall in debris. Few buildings in the Age of Sorrows are built to withstand a sinkhole of this size — only a rare few geomantic marvels, manses, and [[First Age]] structures are capable of resisting it.
When used in a body of water, the spell instead creates a maelstrom that draws anything in its wake into the depths with similar results. Ships caught in the maelstrom must resist its pull each round, suffering two points of hull damage for every failure. If destroyed, the ship sinks into the depths.
## Control
During the scene in which it was cast, the sinkhole is truly bottomless, leading to the Labyrinth.
Those who fall in appear there at a point of the Storyteller’s choosing. On moonless nights, specters may sometimes emerge from the sinkhole in pursuit of their dark ambitions.
## Distortion (10)
A swift necromancer may distort the spell before it expands to medium range, delaying that by their (Essence/2, rounded up) rounds. If it has already expanded, distortion instead reduces the difficulty to resist the howling winds by half, rounded up.
