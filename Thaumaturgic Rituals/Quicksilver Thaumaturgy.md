# Perspire The Passions
Via the rites taught at the Lake, one may ingest quicksilver to sweat out specific memories or Intimacies, which can be bottled and ingested to reclaim them. Quicksilver is a [[Poison]] on (damage of 2B, interval one day, penalty −2, and duration 10). One may choose to suffer the full duration to remove the maximum number of memories or [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]: one day per scene of memory, two days for a minor Intimacy, three days for a Major.
