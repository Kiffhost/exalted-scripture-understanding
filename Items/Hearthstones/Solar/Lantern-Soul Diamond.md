While this clear, colorless hearthstone is socketed in an attuned artifact, the Exalt can spend five minutes of meditation to funnel the entirety of her bonfire anima into its depths. Thus charged, the stone blazes with the colors of the Exaltâ€™s anima, shedding light as brightly as any lantern. At any time, she may expend this charge either to raise her anima by one level, or to pay one level of anima as part of a Charm or Evocation cost.
