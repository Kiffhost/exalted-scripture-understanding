*Blue-white flickers of electricity arc across the Immaculate’s weapon or limbs, lancing out in a brilliant stroke of lightning as she strikes.*
She extends the range of her decisive attack by one range band (maximum long) and adds ([[Essence]] + [[Strength]]) attack roll extra successes as dice of damage. Her attack ignores [[Hardness]] from metal armor, including those made from the five magical materials.
In Air Aura, the Immaculate’s attack also ignores cover (Exalted, p. 199) from metallic objects or structures, passing through them in a flash of lightning. Even enemies in full cover from such structures can be attacked if the Immaculate can see them, but receive +3 [[Defense]].
