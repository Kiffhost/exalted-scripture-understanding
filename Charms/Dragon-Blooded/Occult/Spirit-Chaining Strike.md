*Dragging a spirit halfway into the material realm with her attack, the Dragon-Blood exposes it to her allies.*
She rolls a gambit using any combat Ability against a dematerialized foe, adding (Essence/2, rounded up) bonus successes on the attack roll. [[Spirit-Grounding Shout]] enhances this attack for free. The difficulty of the gambit is equal to (the target’s [[Essence]]). A successful gambit weaves gossamer threads of wind through the spirit, binding it partly to the material world. While it doesn’t become fully materialized, it’s visible to all Dragon-Blooded characters in the scene, and can attack or be attacked by them as though it were material. This lasts for one round, plus an additional round for every two threshold successes the Exalt rolled on the gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll.
