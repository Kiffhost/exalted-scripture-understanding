*Drawing on boundless cunning and persuasiveness, the Lunar deceives even the keenest eyes.*
She rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Linguistics]]) to forge a written work. If she lacks a copy of the original to work from, she suffers a penalty: recreating a book she’s read once incurs a −3 penalty, while working entirely off second-hand descriptions incurs a −5 penalty. As long as she rolls a single success, the forgery succeeds. Characters who have reason to doubt its authenticity can roll ([[Perception]] + {Investigation or Linguistics}) at a difficulty of (the Lunar’s [[Essence]] + [[Manipulation]]) to realize it’s a fake. If the Lunar knows [[Mirror-Hand Stroke]], she may forge new works in a character’s handwriting and style, so long as she has access to a single book-length sample of his writing or three smaller samples, such as letters, poems, or memoranda. If she has both a writing sample and the original author’s heart’s blood, the difficulty to detect the forgery increases by 1. Alternatively, the Lunar can counterfeit a specific object with a [[Craft]] project, including artifacts and similar magical objects, though these forgeries are always mundane in function. As with texts, she suffers a penalty if she lacks firsthand access to the copied object. Characters may roll ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Bureaucracy]], or Investigation}) against difficulty (Lunar’s [[Essence]] + [[Manipulation]]) to spot a counterfeit if they examine it closely, without needing specific reason to suspect it.
