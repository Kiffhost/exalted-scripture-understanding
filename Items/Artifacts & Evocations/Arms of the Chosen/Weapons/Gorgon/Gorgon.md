Gorgon contains an ancient monstrosity, neither god nor demon, that once walked in deep places that have yet to see the sun. A sluggish thing, its undying hatred for all life restrained only by its sloth, this monster was bound by an ancient race, sealed within a weapon where its wickedness might be turned to practical use. But that was ages ago, and its makers, its victims, and even the horror’s name have long been forgotten — as has the nameless artificer who reshaped it into a daiklave for use by Exalted hands. Though storied in the Underworld, Gorgon appears in only a few of Creation’s legends, such as the tale of how Prince Oye returned from the grave to turn her seven daughters to stone, only for her youngest to sing the blade to sleep. Most recently, in the Age of Sorrows, it has been claimed by Shards of Basalt, a deathknight in service to the Walker in Darkness. Her relentless will drives the listless blade to action, and in her hands it has left a trail of petrified corpses across Underworld and Creation alike. Gorgon’s white jade blade, quarried from the shadowed mines of Nhur, is the gray of wood ash. Blood leaves no stain upon it, instead being absorbed into the jade, which grows paler and brighter with each drop until it glows a brilliant, unnatural white. A closed eye is engraved on one side of the blade. Though the sword sleeps, its malice confined by its prison of jade, violence and bloodshed can stir it from dormancy. As it wakes, its eye slowly creeps open, its nameless evil flowing outward through its dreadful gaze. 
 
## Evocations of Gorgon

Abyssal Exalted have an affinity for the devil in the sword. They’re resonant with Gorgon even though it’s made of jade. Gorgon drinks the life of those it kills, and their remains immediately turn to stone. The Essence of an immortal spirit thus slain is trapped until the statue is broken, as are the ghosts and hungry ghosts of mortal victims. The devil in the sword only stirs at the taste of blood. Most of Gorgon’s Evocations can only be activated when it’s reached a certain level of wakefulness. In addition, as the sword awakens, waves of terror pour from its open eye to fill enemy hearts with dread. Successful​ withering attacks inflicted while the eye is open add automatic successes equal to its Wakefulness rating on the withering damage roll. When Gorgon inflicts decisive damage or deals Magnitude damage to a battle group, its Wakefulness increases by one step if the Exalt rolled a number of 10s that equal or exceed the next step’s Wakefulness rating. A character dissonant with jade cannot raise Gorgon’s Wakefulness above Half-Open. While the eye is shut, the Exalt can reflexively spend one WillpowertorouseGorgonfromdeepslumber,openingthe eye to slitted. She may even do so unconsciously, the blade responding to dangers of which its wielder is unaware. The sword’s Wakefulness can only increase once per turn. Lifeless foes such as zombies and automata may not appeal sufficiently to Gorgon’s appetites to awaken it, at the Storyteller’s discretion. All Wakefulness is lost at end of scene, the sword’s eye closing. Wakefulness Rating Closed +0 Slitted +1 Half-Open +2 Wide Open +3
