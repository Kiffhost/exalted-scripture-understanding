*The Abyssal is become war itself. She watches with ten thousand eyes, marches on ten thousand feet, and kills with ten thousand terrible hands.*
The Abyssal opens a lasting mental link with an allied battle group within long range. All of its members have a Tie of loyalty to her. This has the effects of [[Hive-Mind Horror Tactics]] (p. XX), as well as the following:
 - The battle group’s members cannot disobey the Abyssal when she makes her will known, subject only to the limits of unacceptable influence.
 - The battle group gains perfect morale (Exalted, p. 210). If it already had it, it gains +1 [[Might]] instead.
 - The Abyssal can reflexively tap into the senses of the battle group’s members. She can make rolls with [[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], and [[Survival]] through the group’s perspective, adding ([[Size]]) dice, and can enhance them with magic as usual. While sharing the battle group’s senses, the Abyssal can’t use her own.
 - When the battle group enters combat, the deathknight Joins Battle even if she isn’t present, rolling ([[Wits]] + [[War]]) with ([[Essence]]) successes. The battle group uses her successes if they’re higher than its own. The only actions she can take are command actions targeting the linked group and using [[War]] [[Charms]].
This link remains open regardless of the distance between the Abyssal and controlled battle group.
This Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes on undead battle groups and battle groups that benefit from [[Acclaimed Company of Sinners]].
