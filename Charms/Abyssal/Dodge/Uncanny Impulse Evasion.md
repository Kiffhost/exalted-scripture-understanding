*The Abyssal moves before she knows why, guided by her preternatural instinct for danger.*
The Abyssal can dodge an ambush or a similar unseen peril. Her base Evasion is set to 2, and she adds +1 Evasion for every 1 and 2 on the attack roll (or comparable roll for other hazards). If this raises her Evasion 5+, she may use other Dodge Charms against the ambush and can use them after the attack roll. She only needs Evasion 4+ against enemies with lower Initiative and mortals.
