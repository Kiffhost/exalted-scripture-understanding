The Sidereal changes her perspective and herself, donning feathers better suited to a bird’s-eye view of Creation. The Sidereal transforms into a crow, raven, or other corvid (use raiton traits, Exalted, p. 570), with the following effects: 
-  She loses any mutations she possesses intrinsically (but not those granted by magic). 
-  When she takes an action that raitons have dice pools for, she can use that pool if it’s higher than her own. Any dice over her base (Attribute + Ability + specialty) count as Charm dice. 
-  She can use a raiton’s natural weapons. If her (Dexterity + Brawl) pool is higher than a natural weapon’s attack pool, her withering attacks with it gain +1 Accuracy in addition to using her pool. 
-  She gains the animal’s innate special abilities and Merits. Dice or successes added by these count as Charm bonuses. 
-  She remains capable of speech, like ravens and many other corvids. 
-  Any equipment she can’t use in bird form vanishes Elsewhere for this Charm’s duration. 
-  She can’t use Martial Arts to attack or block or use Martial Arts Charms. Any ongoing Martial Arts Charms end. 
-  Onlookers can’t tell she isn’t what she seems unless they have superhuman or magically enhanced senses; doing so requires a difficulty 7 (Perception + Awareness) roll, with success revealing she’s a shapeshifter in animal form.
