The Lunar reaches out through her bond with her familiar, ennobling it with divine Essence. She confers the following benefits on one of her animal familiars: Argent Companion Aegis: If the Lunar has moonsilver tattoos, they spread across her familiar’s body, granting it their benefits (p. XX). If she conceals her tattoos, her familiar’s are also concealed. Bond of the Hunt: The familiar can take the Lunar’s place in a sacred hunt, granting her the shape of its prey at hunt’s end. First Among Beasts: The familiar exudes bestial majesty. Treat all non-familiar animals as having a Minor Tie of reverence toward it, or a Major Tie for animals of the same species. Unbreakable Loyalty: The familiar gains a Defining Tie of loyalty to the Lunar. No influence, other than the Lunar’s, can make it act against this Intimacy. This Charm’s experience point cost is waived the first time the Lunar uses it. If a familiar enhanced by this Charm dies, the Lunar regains any experience spent enhancing it.
