The Immaculate flows between offense and defense, lunging forward to strike before returning to a defensive posture. She can flurry a full defense with an attack, ignoring the Defense penalty for flurrying. In Water Aura, if the Immaculateâ€™s attack succeeds, the Initiative cost of her full defense is refunded.
