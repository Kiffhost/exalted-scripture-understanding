Once per day, the Exalt can draw from the deep well of her vitality to restore her momentum. Roll half the Solar’s total health levels, rounded up, and add successes to her Initiative score. Do not include temporary health levels created by Iron Skin Concentration, Living Bonds Unburdened, or similar Charms. This Charm is reset when the Solar awakens from a full night’s rest. Once per scene at Essence 3+, the Solar may pay an additional 1wp to remove the Perilous keyword from this Charm for an instant.
