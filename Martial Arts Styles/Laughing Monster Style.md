# [[Laughing Monster Style]]
The fae warrior-saints of the Court of Flayed Sinners distilled Laughing Monster style from the digested dreams of countless thieves, scavenger princes, and oathbreakers drawn by rumors of the unimaginable treasures they guarded. This reign of false virtue was ended by the shaman Juven Fifth-Summer, who tore off the face of the court’s prince and coaxed the style’s secrets from his ragged lips, using them to set the raksha against each other until none remained. 
Laughing Monster style epitomizes impetuosity and wicked humor, employing misdirection and confusion to humiliate rivals with inordinate glee. Its stylists practice erratic breathing exercises, rolling dance-steps, and ego-destroying meditations to fully understand its secrets. It has spread to numerous dojos, secret societies, and criminal syndicates. It’s regarded as a style of thieves, revolutionaries, madmen, and all manner of trickster-heroes, as unpredictable as any devil born of the Wyld.
## Weapons
Laughing Monster style uses open-handed slaps, elbow strikes, and sweeping kicks. It also employs the [[staff]], [[Wind and Fire Wheel Fan|war fan]], and [[whip]]. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced with Laughing Monster [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage. 
## Armour
Laughing Monster is incompatible with armor.
## Complementary Abilities
Laughing Monster’s evasive footwork relies on [[Dodge]], while [[Presence]] or [[Socialize]] are useful for its trickery. Its students value [[Occult]], for they delve into obscure, worrisome practices.
