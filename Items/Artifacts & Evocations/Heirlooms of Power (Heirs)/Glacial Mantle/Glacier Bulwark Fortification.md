Dense layers of ice freeze over [[Glacial Mantle]], reinforcing the armor with impervious strength. She gains ([[Essence]]) temporary −0 health levels. These temporary levels are the first to be filled when she’s damaged, and vanish when damaged. Additionally, each temporary health level remaining grants [[Glacial Mantle]] +1 soak.
Fire-based attacks ignore this bonus soak.
The wearer can use this Evocation reflexively, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost, when she activates [[Harvest-Killing Frost]].
This Evocation can only be used once per scene.
## Dissonant
This Evocation can’t be awakened by characters dissonant with [[Glacial Mantle]].
## Resonant
For every two temporary health levels remaining, [[Glacial Mantle]] gains +1 [[Hardness]]. Fire-based attacks ignore this [[Hardness]] bonus.
