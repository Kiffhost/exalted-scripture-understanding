**Example Manse**: A sweeping observatory where paper talismans hang from lofty beams, describing intricate mathematical observations about the Calendar of Setesh. 
When set into a corpse, this cabochon sphere animates it as a [[zombie]] (Exalted, p. 502) with a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to the stone’s master. The master can share the zombie’s senses, as if it were a [[Familiar]] (Exalted, p. 161). If the stone’s master wishes to retrieve it from afar, she may destroy it reflexively, causing it to reform it within its manse instantly.
