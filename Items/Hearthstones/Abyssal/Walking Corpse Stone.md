This rough-hewn grey hearthstone feels leathery to the touch, and is shot through with crimson flaws. When placed within a corpse just prior to burial (the grave may be as shallow as desired, but the corpse must be completely buried), this jewel will cause the corpse to rise as a zombie at the next sunset, under the control of the one who buried it. The stone need not remain with the corpse for it to stay animated and loyal, and may be used to raise another zombie at the next sunset.
