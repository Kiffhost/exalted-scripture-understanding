*The Infernal hones her senses to monstrous perfection, fit for the kaleidoscopic riot that is Hell.*

The Infernal adds two dice on Awareness rolls and rerolls 6s until they cease to appear. If she suffers penalties from environmental conditions unique to Malfeas — the raucous music of demons, the darkness of the Ebon Dragon’s shadow, the Endless Desert’s sandstorms — the penalty is reduced by (Perception/2, rounded up).

While using [[All-Hunger Rapacity]], [[Hateful Wretched Noise]], [[Imperious Hellfire Eye]], or [[Orbit Soul Proxemics]], the Infernal rerolls 5s as well as 6s on rolls using the sense enhanced by that Charm.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has the [[Evolved Sense]] feature, its bonus increases to ([[Perception]]) dice.
## [[Keys]]
#### Seven Devils Meditation (Awareness 3)
The dice added by [[Six-Demon Senses]] are non-Charm. The penalty reduction applies to all forms of environmental conditions, not just those of Hell.
