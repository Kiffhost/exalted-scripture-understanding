*From the fitful dreams of Hell, the Infernal conjures a vision of kingship unbroken, unsullied, a steed and rider to bestride all Creation.*

The Infernal draws forth a demonic apotheosis from a mount she’s blessed with [[Wild-Ruling Overlord]] or [[Woeful Spasm-Warped Coursier]]. This has the following effects:
- The mount gains Legendary Size (p. XX). If it already had it, it grows further still: it can make natural attacks out to short range, and enemies within short range of it must disengage to move away.
- All characters count as having Major Ties of terrified awe toward the Infernal and her mount.
- The Infernal adds (her Essence) to both her and her mount’s base Initiative, and to the amount of Initiative they receive for crashing enemies.
- Enemies must pay one Willpower to attack the Infernal (but not her mount). Even if they do, they lose three Initiative before making the attack. Once a character spends three Willpower this way, he’s immune to this effect for the rest of the scene.
- The ground becomes difficult terrain for all other characters within medium range — friend or foe — as the world pays obeisance to her. The earth heaves to salute her; trees bow before her; rivers spill out of their banks to become her gown. Natural features, vegetation, and fauna may be transformed, becoming wilder and more roughly-sketched, like a first draft of the world.
- On each of her turns, the Infernal can demand abasement from a single enemy within medium range, or from all battle groups and trivial enemies in medium range. She reflexively makes a special ({Appearance or Wits} + Ride) persuade roll. Affected characters must use their movement action on their next round to prostrate themselves before the Infernal, falling prone. Alternatively, the Infernal can pose a question to her target and demand an answer, rather than his obeisance.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she uses [[Monstrous Hell-Rider Unity]], waiving this Charm’s Willpower cost.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Infernal/Devil-Body Powers/Legendary Size|Legendary Size]], she can use this Charm reflexively when she enters her [[Devil-Body]], waiving its Willpower cost.
