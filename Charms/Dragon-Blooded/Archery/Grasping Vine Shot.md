*The Dragon-Blood’s arrow grows and extends into a sturdy, flexible vine.*
This rope attaches itself to a surface within short range. Flame weapons instead discharge braided ropes of semi-tangible smoke. She treats the rope as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580), and can use reflexive move actions to climb it, ascending or descending one range band, or to swing along it, moving one range band forward and, optionally, one range band down. Other characters don’t gain the movement benefits, but still treat the rope as exceptional.
Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood may fire at an unattended object within short range that she’s capable of holding in her hands. The Storyteller may require a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Archery]]) roll in the case of very small objects or poor visual or weather conditions. If successful, the line attaches to the object and retracts, dragging it to the Dragon-Blood’s feet undamaged.
Ropes created with [[Grasping Vine Shot]] wither or disperse at end of scene. If the Dragon-Blood has a relevant [[Craft]], like ropemaking, she receives craft points for meeting objectives with this Charm as though she’d completed a basic project (Exalted, p. 240).
