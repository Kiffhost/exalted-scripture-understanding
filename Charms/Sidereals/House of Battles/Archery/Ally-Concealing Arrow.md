*The Sidereal’s feint creates a blind spot in her enemy’s guard, leaving him vulnerable to a fatal strike.*
A successful distract gambit lets its beneficiary reflexively roll Stealth to enter concealment. If he beats the opposed roll of the gambit’s target and attacks her before she takes her next turn, his attack becomes an ambush (Exalted, p. 203).
## Special activation rules
The Sidereal can use Misdirected Wisdom Trick reflexively to enhance the gambit, waiving its Initiative cost.
## Reset
Once per scene.
