The Dragon-Blood is a master of concealing small items, whethersmugglingcontrabandthroughaportorconcealing her lock picks in her coiffure. She rolls ([Dexterity or Appearance] + [[Larceny]]) to conceal on her body a single item small enough for her to hold in one hand, or an entire set of thieves’ tools, such as a roll of lockpicking equipment or a disguise kit. Characters cannot roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) to contest this concealment unless they’re within short range of the Exalt or use magic that extends the range of their senses. She may stack up to ([[Dexterity]]) uses of this Charm to conceal multiple items.
