In the moment before she strikes, the Solar focuses her [[Essence]] along the edge of her blade, making it infinitely sharp. Fueling an attack with this Charm guarantees it one automatic success, and grants it one bonus die of damage, guaranteeing that die gets rolled regardless of the target’s soak or hardness. If she is using this Charm in combination with the [[Clash]] keyword to destroy rubble or other heavy scenery that has been hurled at her with a decisive gambit, this Charm grants three automatic successes to the [[Initiative]] roll.

### On [[Gleaming Sever]]

A nice little boost of power to help round out [[Essence]] 1 [[Melee]]. This Charm’s effect has been balanced against narrative, owing to the dramatic effect a powerful blow has on an object in motion. Storytellers should be wary about allowing it to easily cut down stationary objects like massive fortress gates or thick castle walls.
