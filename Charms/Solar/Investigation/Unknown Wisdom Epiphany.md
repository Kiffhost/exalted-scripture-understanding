By visiting the scene of an event and attuning herself to local Essence flows and residues, the Exalt can psychically reenact history, reconstructing an event to the point of gaining insight she could not receive from evidence alone. The Solar must have time to go over the scene, to touch and examine evidence and retrace steps in order to empathize with and adapt the perspective of one of the involved parties. The Lawgiver experiences flashbacks of the event from the perspective of the party she is emulating, and gains insights into the characterâ€™s persona, including his emotions over the course of the re-enacted event, and the basic meaning behind the behavior he enacted. An Exalt reenacting an event is rarely dangerous, but if disturbed she may very briefly cling to the adopted persona before snapping back to the current moment.
