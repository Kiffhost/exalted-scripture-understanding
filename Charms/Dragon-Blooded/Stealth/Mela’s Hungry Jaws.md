The Dragon-Blood steals the very air from her victim’s lungs, suffocating him without ever laying a hand on him or being seen. This Charm can only be used while in concealment, against an enemy within medium range who’s unaware of the Dragon-Blood. She steals his breath, causing him to begin to asphyxiate (Exalted, p. 232). Trivial opponents never receive a chance to hold their breath, even outside of combat. The Terrestrial cannot move while using this Charm to siphon her foe’s breath, but neither can her victim move without rolling a disengage against her, regardless of the distance between them. A victim can only break free of [[Mela’s Hungry Jaws]] by successfully finding the Dragon-Blood with a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll or withdrawing to extreme range. His allies can attempt to free him by attacking the Dragon-Blood once they’ve found her. Even if the attack roll misses, as long as it rolled no1s, this Charm ends, while a hit automatically ends it.
