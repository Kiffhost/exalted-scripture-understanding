*The Dragon-Blood learns best by teaching, cultivating the garden of her own mind as she sows the seeds of wisdom among her students.*
Once per story, when she acts as a mentor or trainer to another character (Exalted, p. 178), she may impart her student with a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards herself while accepting a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards him. Each [[Intimacy|Tie]] has a positive emotional context that is defined by the player of the character that gains it. If the Dragon-Blooded maintains her [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards a student until the end of the story, she permanently gains a free [[Lore]] specialty that relates to what she taught her student and what she learned from him. Providing riding lessons to a Hearthmate might grant a [[Lore]] specialty in equestrianism, while instructing a young scion of a Great House in academic topics might grant a specialty in the affairs of that house.
