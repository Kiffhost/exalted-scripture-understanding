*Countless possibilities converge as the Sidereal crosses blades with her foe; her skill and precision ensure a favorable outcome to the exchange.*
When the Sidereal clashes, the opposing attack roll suffers +1 target number. If she clashed by delaying her turn, success refunds the two Initiative lost for doing so.
If an enemy initiates a clash with magic, the Sidereal may use this Charm reflexively before rolling.
