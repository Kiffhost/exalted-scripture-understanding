*Embracing her purpose as a world-killing weapon, the deathknight finds certainty amid storms of doubt.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after her [[Resolve]] is beaten by influence that forces her into a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]]. She can cite an act of death’s chivalry she’s performed in the current story — or the previous one, if it ended shortly ago — as if it were a Defining [[Intimacy]] in a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]]. Doing so waives the [[Willpower]] cost to resist.
## Reset 
Once per story unless reset by upholding a Defining [[Intimacy]] with an act of death’s chivalry.
