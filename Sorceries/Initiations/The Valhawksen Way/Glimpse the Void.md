*Inhaling subterranean vapors, smoke from burning oleander, or other mind-altering fumes, the sorcerer glimpses truths beyond mortal ken.*
Once per story, she can enter such an ecstatic trance and describe the vision she receives, rolling ([[Essence]] + [[Willpower]]) and banking [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Motes|sorcerous motes]] equal to her successes, which last until the story ends. She can subsequently declare that her vision symbolized the events of the current scene as part of a [[stunt]], gaining (Essence x {stunt+1}) [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Motes|sorcerous motes]] for that scene. She can only make such a declaration once per story, and must base it on her most recent vision.
