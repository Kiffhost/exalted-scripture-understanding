*The Abyssal drifts across the battlefield with the blasé indifference of one well-accustomed with death.*
After the deathknight successful disengages, if her enemy pursues her and she uses her reflexive movement, she can gain two [[Initiative]] if she uses her next movement action to enter close range with him.
Additionally, the Abyssal can spend one mote when she disengages to avoid losing [[Initiative]].
