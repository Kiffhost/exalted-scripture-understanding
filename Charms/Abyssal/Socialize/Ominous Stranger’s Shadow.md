*The deathknight preys upon the fear of the unknown, cultivating anticipatory dread among those who know her not.*
The Abyssal adds a non-Charm die on a [[threaten]] roll or other fear-based [[influence roll]] for each of the following criteria that applies to her target, maximum (higher of [[Essence]] or 3). If her [[influence roll]] has multiple targets, she only adds dice for criteria that apply to all of them.
 - They don’t know her title or her former name.
 - They don’t know she’s an Abyssal.
 - They don’t know any of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]].
 - They aren’t aware of her presence.
 - They’ve failed a roll against her [[Guile]] this session.
If the Abyssal meets all five criteria, this Charm’s cost is waived.
