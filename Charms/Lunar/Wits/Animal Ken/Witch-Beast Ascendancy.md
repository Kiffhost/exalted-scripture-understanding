*Breathing an unknowable secret into her familiar’s soul, the Lunar opens its eyes to forbidden wisdoms.*
She initiates a familiar that she’s uplifted with [[Erudite Beast-Mind Expansion]] into Terrestrial Circle [[sorcery]], granting it an 8-die [[Sorcery]] pool and one Terrestrial Circle spell she knows as its control spell. She can increase the familiar’s [[Sorcery]] pool using [[Erudite Beast-Mind Expansion]], and teach it Terrestrial Circle spells she knows using [[Nature-Reinforcing Allocation]] as though they were magical abilities. She must pay the experience point cost of sorcerous workings her familiar performs. This Charm can be repurchased to initiate multiple familiars. If a familiar dies, the Lunar regains experience spent purchasing this Charm for it.
