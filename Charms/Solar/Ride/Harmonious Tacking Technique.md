With skill, flair, and [[Essence]], the Exalt instills a mount’s gear with harmonious movements, causing straps to flow together and cinch, latches to buckle, blankets to smooth and armor to settle perfectly in line with her dramatic tacking and barding actions. Normally, it takes minutes to tack and bard a mount, as described on page 204, but the entire process can be shortened through use of this Charm. Roll the Exalt’s ([[Dexterity]] + [[Ride]]) against a difficulty of 3. On a success, she can tack a mount in a single turn, while failure sees it tacked in two turns. After tacking a mount, the Solar may reuse this Charm to affix its armor. Quickly armoring a steed works the same way—the Lawgiver armors the mount in one or two turns, depending on her success. Finally, the Exalt may use this Charm again to arm a fully tacked and barded steed with as many as three weapons in a single turn upon success, or one per turn if she fails. The steed she prepares with this Charm need not be her own.
