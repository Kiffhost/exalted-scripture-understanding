Few large-scale battles end when all the soldiers of one side kill all the soldiers of the other side. At some point in almost every battle, one side breaks, and soldiers begin to flee, or if that is impossible, to cast down their weapons and attempt to surrender. These moments when a battle group’s will is tested are known as rout checks.

A rout check occurs whenever a [[battle group]]’s [[Magnitude Track]] fills up with damage and it loses a point of [[Size]]. Having so many of its soldiers whittled away causes the group to hesitate, and there’s always the danger that this hesitation could spread into full-blown panic and retreat—a sufficiently daunting assault by a small, elite group may even cause a vastly superior force to panic and collapse into disorder.

A rout check is normally a [[Willpower]] roll, using the Willpower rating of the average fighter in the battle group, as modified by the unit’s [[Drill]]. The [[Dice Rolls#Difficulty|difficulty]] of a rout check begins at 1, but may be modified in a number of ways:

| Difficulty | Condition Modifier                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| +1         | Another allied battle group has already suffered dissolution during the fight.                                                       |
| +1         | One or more of the battle group’s leaders or heroes have been incapacitated or killed during the battle.                             |
| +1         | per point of Size the battle group has already lost during the scene.                                                                |
| +1         | The rout check is provoked by a devastating supernatural area-of-effect assault such as the spell [[Death of Obsidian Butterflies]]. |

If the rout check succeeds, the battle group loses a point of Size and restores all points of Magnitude. If it fails, the battle group suffers *dissolution* on its next turn and attempts to surrender or run—either way, it’s no longer a meaningful participant in the battle.
