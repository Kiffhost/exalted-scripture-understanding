*The Infernal denies her presence to those unworthy to prostrate themselves before her.*

When the Infernal makes a disengage roll or opposes a rush roll, beating an enemy’s roll causes him to move one range band away. He doesn’t cross the space between, nor is he aware of this movement — only he isn’t where he was before. If the Infernal uses this Charm while disengaging, she doesn’t receive that action’s usual movement on her turn, but still receives the reflexive moment from the disengage if an affected enemy pursues her.

This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived if the Infernal only uses it against one enemy.
## [[Keys]]
#### Foe-Swallowing Sandstorm Displacement (Dodge 5) (+5m)
When the Infernal uses this Charm to disengage, she may pay a five-mote surcharge to roll against all enemies within short range.
#### Lost in Futility (Dodge 5, Essence 3)
Affected enemies can’t rush the Infernal or oppose her disengage rolls until the end of her next turn, unless their Initiative is higher than hers. Even then, they suffer a −1 penalty on rolls to rush her or oppose her disengages for the rest of the scene.
#### Endless Horizons Unfolding (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she uses this Charm against a single enemy to distort space even further. For the rest of the scene, he counts as one range band further away from her than he actually if this is disadvantageous to him. He can overcome this by making a special rush action against her from “short” range. If he succeeds, he ignores this effect until the beginning of his next turn.
#### Demon-Gaoler’s Durance (Essence 5, [[#Endless Horizons Unfolding (+1wp)|Endless Horizons Unfolding]]) (+6m, 2i)
The Infernal can use [[#Endless Horizons Unfolding (+1wp)|Endless Horizons Unfolding]] against multiple enemies for an alternative surcharge of six motes and two Initiative.
