The martial artist has resigned herself to never knowing she might meet her death; her unhesitating action chills the blood of those who still cling to survival. The stylist adds (higher of Essence or 3) to her effective Initiative to determine when she takes her turn. If she takes her turn before any enemy does, all enemies increase their wound penalty by one for that round. 
## Mastery

If an enemy already suffers a wound penalty, the stylist automatically takes her turn before him, doing so one tick before him unless sheâ€™d normally act before then.
