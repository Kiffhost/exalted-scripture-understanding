The Exalt fires an arrow of wildly blazing colors that strikes at its target’s sanity. This Evocation is a passion-inciting gambit that also imposes a Minor Derangement related to the inflamed passion. If he already has a related Derangement, its intensity is strengthened one step instead. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation.
