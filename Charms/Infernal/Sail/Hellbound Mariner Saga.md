*Be they Creation’s oceans or the acidic tides of the Demon Sea, there are no waters beyond the Infernal’s skill to ply.*

The Infernal adds (Sail) non-Charm dice and rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on a Sail roll. She also rerolls 5s while sailing on the waterways of Hell or captaining a ship crewed by demons or Demon-Blooded.

Once per day, the Infernal gains one Willpower when rerolling dice with this Charm lets her succeed on a roll she would have failed.

This Charm isn’t compatible with Sail-based attack rolls, like for [[Ichor Flux Tendrils]].
## [[Keys]]
#### The Tide Turns (Sail 5)
The Infernal can use this Charm after a roll. She always rerolls 5s.
#### Infernal Admiral Majesty (Sail 5, Essence 2) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to roll an additional non-Charm die for each success on the initial roll, plus another non-Charm die for each 6 that’s rerolled into a failure.
