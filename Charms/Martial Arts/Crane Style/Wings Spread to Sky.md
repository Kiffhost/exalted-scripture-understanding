*Majestic and beautiful as the soaring crane, the martial artist leaps into the air, flying on the invisible currents of Essence that flow through it.* 
Wings Spread to Sky may supplement any movement action, allowing the martial artist to fly through the air to complete the movement. If the martial artist is protecting a character with a defend other action, she may choose to carry him along with her, if he is willing and she has at least one hand free to carry him (or stunts around this limitation). On the offense, if the Crane stylist uses this flight to close the distance before making a decisive attack, she doubles 10s on the damage roll.
If the martial artist ends her movement in mid-air or on a structure that could not support her weight, she may retain a stable footing there until her next turn. If she then uses a movement action to descend or alight on a viable footing, she suffers no impairment. 
Otherwise—for example, if she uses Wings Spread to Sky a second time to soar upward and attack an aerial foe—she falls gracefully to the earth at the end of her turn. She (and anyone with her) still takes falling damage, but may ignore up to (Dexterity) range bands of descent for purpose of calculating it. This Charm can be used reflexively to mitigate the damage from a fall in this manner, even if the martial artist was not in flight beforehand.
