*The shadows of the unseen world whisper secret truths to those who listen.*
The Abyssal can pay a four-mote surcharge when she uses Lingering Echo Meditation to experience a more lucid vision, reliving events from the perspective of the primary aggressor as if she had been there.
She can make [[Awareness]] and [[Investigation]] rolls to examine things, and can use magic to enhance these rolls normally. She can also use [[Investigation]] [[Charms]] that make sense in this context, like DeceptionPiercing Stare, though she can’t use Simple [[Charms]].
The Abyssal experiences the emotional state of the character whose perspective she adopts, though gleaning any insight into his thoughts, motives, or memories requires a [[profile character]] roll against him within the vision. She gains a Minor [[Intimacy]] chosen by her player based on whatever emotion the killer felt.
Alternatively, the Abyssal may pay a nine-mote surcharge to reconstruct a vision of a non-violent event with a [[case scene]] roll. There must be physical evidence of the event for her to examine, and she may suffer a penalty from old, damaged, or misleading evidence. She can choose whose experience she perceives the scene from.
