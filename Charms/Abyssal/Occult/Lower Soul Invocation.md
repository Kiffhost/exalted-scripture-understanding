*Withered spectral limbs manifest around the Abyssal as she rouses her voracious lower soul, bidding it weave her dark magics.*
The Abyssal flurries a [[Necromancy|Shape Necromancy]] action with a non-attack action, ignoring all penalties from flurrying.
An [[Occult]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Abyssal pay a four-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to extend this Charmâ€™s duration to one scene.
