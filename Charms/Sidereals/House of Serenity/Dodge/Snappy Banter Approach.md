The Sidereal’s quick-witted repartee extracts uncouth suitors from awkward situations. When an ally fails a spoken influence roll with any Ability, the Sidereal can use this Charm to let him roll again. The reroll receives the benefits of all magic used to enhance the first roll; her ally can use additional [[Charms]] to enhance it as well. To use this Charm, the Sidereal must notice her ally’s influence and must be able to speak to all targets so she can make her excuses.
