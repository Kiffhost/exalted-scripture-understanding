*The Infernal sheds tears of molten glass that congeal into floating eyes, orbiting her brow as they stare in all directions.*

The Infernal creates up to (Essence) floating eyes of glass within close range of her, paying three motes per eye. They’re capable of moving independently. She can see through their perspective in addition to her own, and adds an automatic success on vision-based rolls made through them. This increases to two successes on rolls that benefit from being able to see in all directions or from multiple angles.

The Infernal can take a reflexive action on her turn to move one of the eyes one range band in any direction, or a miscellaneous action to move all of them one range band. She can’t move them beyond long range, or more than short range above the ground. They’re immune to withering or decisive damage, but can be destroyed with a difficulty 3 gambit against an Evasion of (Infernal’s Perception).

The floating eyes watch for danger in all directions. When an enemy with lower Initiative makes an unexpected attack against the Infernal, the Defense penalty is reduced by one. This doesn’t apply against enemies who are beyond her glass eyes’ visual range or entirely obscured from their sight.
### Keys 
#### Countless Watching Eyes
The Infernal can create up to (Essence + Perception) eyes. As long as she has at least two eyes manifested, she gains this Charm’s protection against unexpected attacks against enemies of equal or higher Initiative. Crashed enemies’ attacks are never unexpected against her, even ambushes.
#### Hell-Sand Vitrification
The Infernal reduces the cost of creating eyes past the first by two motes each, and extends this Charm’s duration to one day. With Essence 3, it becomes Indefinite.
#### None Escape My Sight
The Infernal’s eyes can travel up to (Essence + Perception) range bands from her. They can travel back to her side as if they were only one range band away, dispersing into molten glass before reforming. She can move multiple eyes reflexively on her turn, rather than needing a miscellaneous action.
#### Unseen Wickedness Gaze (Any two keys) (+5m)
For a five-mote surcharge, the Infernal’s eyes are dematerialized. Doing so also mutes this Charm’s mote cost. The Infernal can make the eyes visible to material observers at will.
