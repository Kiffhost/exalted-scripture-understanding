*The Lunar hunts flock and herd, ever-ready to claim her prey.*
She can aim against all enemies within close range of a single point, instead of an individual. The benefits still only apply to a single attack, but she has more options in whom she attacks. When she makes an attack that benefits from aiming, she can pay two motes and one [[Willpower]] to roll it before choosing which of the enemies she’s aimed at to attack. Each potential target must declare defensive [[Charms]] before the roll. After rolling, she chooses whom to attack. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has a vision-enhancing Merit may learn this as a [[Perception]] Charm.
