The Lunar tears away armor to find the flesh beneath. When she makes a decisive throw or slam against a clinched enemy, she may forgo adding three rounds of forfeited control to the damage roll to instead rip away any mundane armor he wears, or six rounds to destroy it entirely. Artifact armor can be removed for (3 + rating; 10 if N/A) rounds of control, breaking the victimâ€™s attunement. Armor created by Charms, like Glorious Solar Plate, is unaffected. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes capable of Strength 5+ feats of strength, rounds of control spent on this Charm still add to the damage roll.
