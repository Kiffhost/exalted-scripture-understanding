The Sidereal trades a clean ending for an expedient one, hastening her pursuit of documents, a judgment, or divine intervention at the cost of leaving a leaving some loose ends. The Sidereal undertakes a project or bureaucratic task, reducing the interval of time necessary to complete it by one step: years to seasons, seasons to months, months to weeks, and weeks to days. Tasks that would take less than a day are completed instantly. This doesn’t speed physical labor, only the planning, authorization, allocation of resources, and other bureaucratic tasks involved in fulfilling her request. However, something is always left undone — a small task left incomplete, an overlooked problem, an unpaid contractor, etc. It’s only a small inconvenience compared to the project’s significance, but one that may complicate the Sidereal’s life down the line.
