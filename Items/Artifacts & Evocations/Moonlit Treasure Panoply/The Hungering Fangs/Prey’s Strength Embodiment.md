*Drawing on moonsilver’s protean [[Essence]], the fangs’ wielder takes on her prey’s form.*
When the wielder uses [[Lessons of the Hunt]], she may take dots of mutations that reflect her prey’s form in place of specialties.
A Lunar with [[Perfected Hybrid Interaction]] (Lunars, p.
144) can add mutations gained this way to that Charm’s selection of mutations, paying two experience per mutation dot.
