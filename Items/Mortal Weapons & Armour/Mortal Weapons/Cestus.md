The cestus is an arrangement of leather straps that fits around the hand like a fingerless glove. These straps are covered in brass or iron studs, serving to enhance the wearer’s punches. The metal gauntlets that are part of most forms of heavy armor can also be designed to work as cestuses. They’re usually used in pairs.
