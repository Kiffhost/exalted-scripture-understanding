Feeling the Dragon’s Bones The Dragon-Blood’s senses are keenly attuned to the presence of those she disfavors, piercing their deceptions to reveal them to all. When a character that the Dragon-Blood has a negative Major or Defining Tie to comes within long range of her, she may automatically activate this Charm to strip away a single success from any Stealth or disguise rolls that character has made and then make a (Perception + Awareness) roll against him. An Awareness 5, Essence 4 repurchase of this Charm extends this Charm’s effect to (Essence) range bands.
