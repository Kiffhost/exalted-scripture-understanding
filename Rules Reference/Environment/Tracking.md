Tracking (and avoiding trackers) is a Survival action. Tracking is a contested actionâ€”(Wits + Survival) for the party attempting to cover their tracks, against (Perception + Survival) for the tracker. The terrain might inflict penalties on one party or the other, if it is particularly easy to track in, or to avoid leaving tracks in.
