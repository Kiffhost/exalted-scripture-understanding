The fundamental magic of the Exalted, charms are a codified set of talents, tricks and techniques each of which are beyond the abilities of most mortals. Charms are a gameplay abstraction, a character in Creation might understand that some Exalted are particularly hard to kill, but they would not understand any reference to [[Charms/Solar/Resistance/Ox-Body Technique|Ox-Body Technique]] or similar. One exception to this is Martial Arts charms, which are taught from one Exalted to another, and named in so doing.
# Charm Limitations
Many Charms raise a character’s [[dice rolls#Dice Pool|dice pool]] or static values. Such increases have limits, which vary by [[#Charm Style]]. 

**The only exception to this rule exists in the form of rare magic which adds “non-Charm” dice to certain rolls**.

When a charm directly adds successes to a roll, **each success added counts as two dice for the purpose of dice pool bonus maximums**. Naturally, non-Charm successes do not count towards such maximums.

Strictly, these limits also count bonuses from Sorcery, Evocations, and Charms used by other Exalted (including other types of Exalted). See also: [[DICE LIMITS AND THE UN-EXALTED]]
## in Combat
During combat, Exalts may use as many Charms during a single round as they like, so long as they obey the type restrictions of those Charms, or any other restrictions present within the text of the Charm itself, and so long as they can pay the cost of those Charms.

Players (including the Storyteller) must openly declare which Charms their characters are using, and all Charms (unless their text indicates otherwise) must be declared, and their costs spent, before any dice are rolled. **Attackers declare their Charms before defenders**.
# Charm Style
Each type of Exalted manifests a different variety of charms, and it is largely within those charms that we see the fundamental distinction between types of Chosen. 

| Type of Exalted | Max. Charm Dice Pool Bonus                | Max. Static Value Bonus                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solar           | Attribute + Ability                       | (Attribute + Ability)/2 round down                       |
| Dragon-Blood    | Ability + Specialty<sup>1</sup>           | (Ability + Specialty<sup>1</sup>)/2 round down           |
| Lunar           | Attribute + stunted Attribute<sup>2</sup> | (Attribute + stunted Attribute<sup>2</sup>)/2 round down |
| Sidereal        | Higher of Essence or 3, maximum 5         | Higher of Essence or 3, maximum 5                        |
In this table, Attribute or Ability refers to the relevant traits to the roll, or the traits used to calculate a static value. 

<sup>1</sup>Where listed, a relevant specialty in the associated ability adds 1 to the maximum. 

<sup>2</sup>Where listed, stunted Attribute indicates that a Storyteller accepted [[stunt]] will allow second different attribute to be added to the total.
# Order of Operations
Charms that reroll or otherwise remove numbers from a roll’s result perform this action before other Charms can act upon them. If an attacker’s Charm rerolls 1s, a defender’s Charm which turns 1s on the attack roll into negative successes will not function unless the Charm’s text specifically says that it does. 

As a rule of thumb, any Charm that acts on the effects of other actions considers that action after all modifiers have been put in place. If a character has a Charm that increases the base damage of her next attack for every success an opponent rolls, then she would wait until her opponent has used all (if any) rerolling effects before her Charm starts counting successes and turning them into base damage.
## Example
One example of a rerolling Charm is [[Excellent Strike]], while [[Rumor of Form]] is an example of a Charm that preys upon 1s. In a contest, Rumor of Form would be unable to affect an attack supplemented by Excellent Strike.

## Types
Charms come in one of four types, which determine when and how the Charm can be used: [[#Simple]], [[#supplemental]], [[#reflexive]], or [[#permanent]].
### Simple
A simple Charm counts as a [[combat action]] in and of itself, and obeys the normal timing rules of combat actions: it can only be used on the character’s turn. Simple Charms cannot be placed in a [[flurry]], and as a result, a character can only use one simple Charm per round. Simple Charms generally create actions using their governing Ability, unless otherwise indicated.
### Supplemental
Supplemental Charms enhance an [[action]], such as an [[attack]] roll, [[Crafting Projects|crafting]] roll, or [[social influence]] roll. Supplemental Charms can generally only benefit rolls using the Ability they’re listed under, unless otherwise stated. A character may use as many supplemental Charms as she desires during a round, so long as she is taking valid actions for them to enhance. She cannot, however, activate the same Charm on the same action multiple times to stack its effect.
### Reflexive
A reflexive Charm creates a [[Action#Reflexive|reflexive action]] or enhances a non-dice action, such as applying [[Defense]] against an [[attack]], or holding one’s breath. In some cases, such as reflexive Charms to anticipate surprise attacks or to passively notice hidden details, the character may not even realize she is using the Charm until she already has! 

Characters may use any of their reflexive Charms at any time, so long as it makes sense for them to do so, but they can’t “stack” enhancing reflexive Charms. Reflexive Charms which create attacks generally do so with the Ability they belong to, unless the governing Ability can’t normally attack or unless otherwise noted. Reflexive Charms which enhance static values may generally only enhance static values deriving from their governing Ability, unless otherwise indicated.
### Permanent
A permanent Charm is just that—a permanent enhancement to the character’s prowess, normally costing nothing to enjoy and providing its benefits passively at all times. The best example of a permanent Charm is [[Ox-Body Technique]], which permanently grants characters additional health levels.
## Duration
With the exception of *permanent* Charms, any Charm with a duration longer than “instant” requires that any Essence spent on it be **committed**. **Committed** [[Essence]] is “tied up” for the listed duration of the Charm—it cannot be regained until the commitment has been released. Unless specified otherwise, Exalted can reflexively end any such charms by releasing the Essence sustaining them. This Essence can then be regained as normal.
## Prerequisite Charms
If a Charm lists another Charm (or Charms) as its prerequisite, the character must already know all of those Charms before they are able to learn the Charm claiming them as prerequisites. **If a Charm designates a number of non-specific prerequisite Charms, Excellencies never count toward this total**. Furthermore, if prerequisites include a specific Charm and a number of non-specific Charms, **Charms that serve as prerequisites for the specific Charm don’t count toward the non-specific Charms**.
## Terminology
### Repurchases and Upgrades
Some Charms describe an extra effect upon repurchase. This means if a player pays the experience point cost of the Charm again (which sometimes requires meeting a higher prerequisite), the character unlocks new functionality for the Charm. Other Charms merely describe an extra effect with a higher prerequisite, in which case no repurchase is necessary and new functionality unlocks once the new prerequisite is met. 
### Attack Reset
Some Charms reset a character’s attack. When this happens, the character may immediately take another attack action.
