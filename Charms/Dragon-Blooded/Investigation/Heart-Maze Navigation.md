*The Dragon-Blood can test the composure of even the most practiced liar, discovering the path that leads to the truth.*
When she makes a profile character roll, her targetâ€™s [[Guile]] can be penalized by any of his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that would support revealing information to the Dragon-Blood, lowering it as though it were his [[Resolve]].
