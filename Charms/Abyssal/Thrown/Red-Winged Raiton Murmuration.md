*Blood trickles from the wounds of the deathknight’s victims, taking wing as a murder of crimson raitons.*
The Abyssal may use this Charm after damaging multiple nontrivial enemies in a single tick, drawing a raiton of blood from each enemy, maximum (Dexterity). She can draw raitons from undead who once had blood and from spirits, but not from automatons or similar beings.
The blood raitons circle the Abyssal, granting the following benefits
- Ranged attacks against her suffer a −1 penalty for each raiton.
- Enemies who attack her from close range are harried by the raitons, letting her make a decisive counterattack with (Wits + Thrown). It deals one die of damage per raiton, ignoring Hardness, and doesn’t reset the Abyssal’s Initiative.
- She may expend a raiton when she attacks, unleashing it to guide her weapon. This adds (Essence) dice on the attack and damage rolls.
She can unleash a single raiton to enhance all attacks made with Five Birds, One Stone.
The Abyssal can use this Charm again while it’s still active to replenish her flock up to the usual maximum.
She doesn’t commit the cost of subsequent activations.
Once she runs out of raitons, the Charm ends.
