The mercurial Essence flowing through this armor is at its most potent when pushing its wearer on to her fated destination. With this power, once the Exalt has succeeded at one rush action, each additional one she takes in the scene gains one bonus success, even if she takes other actions in between. These successes are cumulative so long as the rush actions are successful; if she fails one, the bonus success count resets to zero. This bonus cannot exceed five automatic successes. This effect is cancelled immediately if the wearer is crashed and must be reactivated if it is to be used again.
