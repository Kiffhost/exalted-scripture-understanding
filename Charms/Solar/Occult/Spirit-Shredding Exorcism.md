After capturing a being within the [[Spirit-Caging Mandala]], the Lawgiver strikes apart the pattern, inverting the mandala to rend apart the being’s [[Essence]]. Roll the Solar’s ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) against the target’s [[Resolve]]. This attack can neither be enhanced nor defended against through an application of Intimacies—nor can it be resisted with [[Willpower]]. If successful, the target’s permanent [[Essence]] is reduced by one until it escapes the pattern, and if the difficulty of binding the target has increased due to a number of successful ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) rolls (as per the rules of [[Spirit-Caging Mandala]]), then the difficulty returns to its base number, the spirit’s [[Essence]] -1. [[Spirit-Shredding Exorcism]] may not be applied more than once to a single target. If this Charm reduces a being’s [[Essence]] to 0, it’s unable to act until it escapes the mandala.
