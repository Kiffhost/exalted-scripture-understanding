The air chills at the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s passage, smoothing her movement and leaving behind an icy trail. When she crosses a range band by walking or running (but not jumping, climbing, or so on), she freezes the ground as she moves across it, leaving a patch of difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) that extends along the path she traveled.
If she makes a roll with any Ability as part of the movement action, she adds an automatic success and ignores any penalties for difficult terrain based on ice or snow.
This Charm can also be used to walk over bodies of water, freezing their surface as the Dragon-Blood moves.
