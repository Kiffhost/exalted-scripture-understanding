The Sidereal’s arrow draws the eye of her enemy, turning his attention where she wants it. The Sidereal makes a distract gambit, adding (Manipulation) dice on the attack and Initiative rolls. If the gambit succeeds and either the attack or Initiative roll beats her enemy’s Resolve, she misdirects his attention to anyone or anything he can perceive. He must use his next turn to take an action that involves it — attacking an enemy, using defend other to protect an ally, picking up a valuable necklace, etc. He can flurry it with an unrelated action, but the flurry penalty on both rolls increases by two.
