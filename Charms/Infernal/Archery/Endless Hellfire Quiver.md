*The Infernal looses arrows of blazing green flame, crackling black lightning, or opalescent sleet, her quiver filled with all the perils of the Demon City's sky.*

The Infernal can make an Archery attack without needing ammunition (including firedust). Decisive attacks deal aggravated damage to mortals and First Circle demons. The Infernal can deal aggravated damage to other enemies by stunting with a description of a hellish bolt that exploits some vulnerability her foe possesses.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal's [[Devil-Body]] has an [[Archery]]-based [[Enhanced Attack]] (p. XX), this Charm also adds an automatic success on the attack roll.
### Keys 
#### Swift Damnation Flare
The Infernal can reflexively reload weapons with the Slow tag. This makes such weapons compatible with magic that creates multiple attacks as long as she reloads for each attack.
