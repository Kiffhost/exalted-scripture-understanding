*The Sidereal waits until the perfect moment to strike, whether with a blade or a well-chosen word.*
In combat, the Sidereal can apply an aim action’s bonus dice to a roll with any Ability, other than an attack.
While the action need not target the enemy that the Sidereal aimed at, the Storyteller may require a stunt to explain how the Sidereal’s restraint and precision aids her in that action.
The Sidereal can use Meditation on Violence to cancel penalties on a roll enhanced by an aim action this way.
