*Schemes and stratagems crumble to dust before the deathkight’s withering scrutiny.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after interacting with someone she has a negative Tie for or observing a project, plan, or other agenda carried out by such a character. She makes an ([Intelligence or Perception] + [[Lore]]) introduce fact roll to reveal a weakness or flaw in her target, adding ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice.
While the Abyssal must still have a relevant [[Lore]] background, she can introduce facts that she couldn’t have feasibly known in advance, letting her reveal details of a target’s personal life and the like. The [[Storyteller]] can still veto facts that contradict established setting details or interfere with the story.
Once the Abyssal has introduced such a fact, she can use this Charm to add ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice on a social and mental action with any Ability that exploit the revealed weakness. This isn’t compatible with attacks, [[Shape Sorcery]] rolls, or extended actions.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm to introduce a flaw for a new target, she can no longer use it to enhance rolls that exploit other flaws she’s previously identified.
