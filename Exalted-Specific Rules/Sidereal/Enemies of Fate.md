Enemies of fate are otherworldly beings outside of fate’s weave: demons, fae, and undead, as well as Getimians, Abyssals, and Infernals. The Storyteller may deem other beings enemies of fate, while some may eventually lose that status by refraining from meddling with fate or destiny and living in Creation or Yu-Shan long enough for the Loom of Fate to account for them.
The undead Liminals are enemies of fate by nature, but maintaining their lifeline to their creator or other living character exempts them from this, serving as their thread of fate. The Alchemical Exalted hail from another world, but their Great Maker long ago integrated himself into fate, a status shared with his world-body’s denizens.
