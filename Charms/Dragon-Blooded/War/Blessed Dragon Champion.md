When the Dragon-Blood steps forward to lead her forces into battle, she never stands alone. To use this Charm, she must be leading her soldiers under a successfully enacted stratagem. She doubles 9s on all [[War]] rolls, and gains +2 [[Defense]] against battle groups. She adds non-Charm dice equal to (the [[Size]] of the largest battle group under her command) on all attacks she makes against enemy battle groups.
