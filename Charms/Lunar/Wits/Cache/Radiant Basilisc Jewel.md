*Sculpting her chakras and [[Essence]] meridians into a geomantic pattern, the Lunar draws forth a pearl that embodies her soul.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, she manifests a greater hearthstone that expresses her nature: her Caste, spirit shape, a Defining [[Intimacy]], etc. It counts as socketed with [[Desert Basilisc Diadem]], although it doesn’t count toward that Charm’s maximum and can’t be removed from her body (including to socket in an artifact, unless she uses [[Last Warrior’s Unity]]). She can manifest Linked hearthstones; she counts as the manse which sustains them. She always enjoys the increased mote recovery for being in an attuned greater demesne (Exalted, p. 160). Such hearthstones are indestructible while the Lunar lives (unlike those socketed using [[Desert Basilisc Diadem]]), but shatter upon her death unless they’re Steady. The Storyteller should veto hearthstone choices that are overpowered if made permanent in this fashion, such as the [[Gem of Incomparable Wellness]].
