The [[Resplendent Dream Brush]] proclaims its painter’s brilliance to the world.
The artist gains the following benefits:
 - Artists see her as one of their own, and count as having a Minor Tie of respect to her. She can suppress or resume this effect reflexively.
 - Fair Folk and other fae can sense her artistic brilliance, and count as having a Minor Tie of fascination to her. She can suppress or resume this effect reflexively.
 - She adds the Resplendent Dream Brush’s equipment bonus on [[Socialize]] rolls involving artists or fae.
 - She can invoke an [[Intimacy]] when she rolls for a [[Craft]] (Painting) project that’s related to that [[Intimacy]], reducing the roll’s craft point cost by ([[Intimacy]]) silver points or (Intimacy/2, rounded up) gold points.
