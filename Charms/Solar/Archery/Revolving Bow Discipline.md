Holding arrows between each finger, the Solar draws down on her target, firing with profound speed and focus. The Solar may draw and attack a single target repeatedly, launching multiple withering attacks until she either misses or crashes her opponent. [[Revolving Bow Discipline]] can only be used within short or close range, and can’t be used on targets already in crash. Used against a battlegroup, the Solar attacks until she misses or depletes the group’s Magnitude. At [[Essence]] 4+, the Solar gains one point of temporary [[Willpower]] when she crashes a foe with this attack.
