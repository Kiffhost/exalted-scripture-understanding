*The deathknight finds apocalyptic insights in the setting of the sun, the entrails of slaughtered beasts, and the death rattles of her victims.*
The Abyssal rolls ([Intelligence or Perception]) + [[Awareness]] with ([[Essence]]) successes as she finds inspiration in the morbid, the eerie, or the darkly beautiful: an albatross dropping dead in flight, three black cats crossing the same street in sequence, lightning striking a distant temple. She banks her successes and gains a Major Principle representing a creative goal inspired by it: the wings of a dying butterfly might inspire her to create a flying monstrosity, while the eerie light of the sun setting on a shadowland might inspire a work of oracular poetry. She can’t voluntarily erode this [[Intimacy]], and it can’t be weakened below Minor as long as she has any banked successes remaining.
The Abyssal can add up to ([[Essence]]) banked successes on [[Craft]], [[Linguistics]], [[Occult]], and [[Performance]] rolls related to her creative goal. They count as a non-Charm bonus, except on extended rolls. [[Medicine]] rolls involved in creating or altering undead can also be enhanced. These rolls need not directly contribute toward the Abyssal’s goal — a deathknight obsessed with building a butterfly-winged horror could add successes on a [[Linguistics]] roll to boast of her plans in a letter to a rival.
Upon fulfilling her goal, the Abyssal loses her Principle. If she has any banked successes remaining, she rolls twice that many dice and gains motes equal to her successes, as well as one [[Willpower]] for each ten.
If she ends this Charm before completing her goal, she loses one [[Willpower]] and can’t use this Charm again for the rest of the session.
[[Whispers]]: When the Abyssal adds banked successes on a roll, she may invoke her [[Whispers]] to add an additional (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) non-Charm dice. She can’t do so on extended actions/
