The Lunar’s familiar becomes a divine monster. She can use Perfected Hybrid Interaction to grant mutations to one of her familiars within medium range enhanced with Blessed Moon-Beast Empowerment. If she currently has a mutation through Perfected Hybrid Interaction or Hybrid Body Transformation, she waives the cost of giving it to a familiar. If the Lunar knows Moon’s Hidden Face (p. XX), she can use it on her familiar’s mutations.
