The Sidereal rolls ([[Strength]] + Endings Ability) opposing her target’s ([[Stamina]] + Endings Ability) roll. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one [[Willpower]] for others. Success hastens his end, inflicting +1 target number on [[Awareness]] rolls to detect danger outside of combat and [[Resistance]] rolls. Once per scene, the Sidereal’s player may grant −1 target number to an attack roll, damage roll, or other harmful roll against him. Cursing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options. Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. Crumbling Bureau Curse (The Haywain): The Sidereal’s target suffers a setback, loses money, or is betrayed. Crushed Butterfly Doom (The Corpse): The Sidereal’s target ignores advice he sought from her about making a change in his life. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively. Dream-Killing Blade (The Sword): The Sidereal’s target discusses his hopes or dreams for the future with her. Face the Inevitable (The Crow): The Sidereal’s target refuses to acknowledge a problem or his own mortality. Unnecessary Burden Affliction (The Rising Smoke): The Sidereal’s target refuses to abandon or give up on something that’s inferior to an alternative, more trouble than it’s worth, or no longer useful to him. These might be people, strategies, institutions, alliances, traditions, etc. The Sidereal can curse multiple characters with this Charm.
