*Seven Star Alignment’s master binds a spell within the patterns of its whirling sections, holding her sorcerous puissance back for when her foes least expect it.*
Upon completing a spell that lets her make an attack, the wielder may use this Evocation to imbue the spell into Seven Star Alignment instead of casting it. Doing so resets her attack if it’s her turn (Exalted, p. 254). Onlookers can identify the imbued spell by observing the sorcerous Essence that flows through the staff’s patterns, requiring a (Perception + Occult) roll at difficulty (Circle + 2). The imbued spell isn’t subject to countermagic. When attacked, the wielder can end this Evocation to counterattack with the imbued spell. She can counterattack with spells that have multiple targets as long as her attacker is included. As usual, this must be declared before the attack roll. The imbued spell is lost if not used by the end of the scene. With an Essence 3 repurchase, the wielder can clash with the spell instead of counterattacking. 
## Dissonant
Casting the imbued spell counts as the wielder’s attack for the round.
