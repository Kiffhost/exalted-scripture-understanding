*The Lunar’s rumormongering stains her victim’s reputation soul-deep.*
She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on an instill roll to create a negative belief about a character present in the scene. Affected characters, other than the accused, also treat this as a persuade roll, convincing them to spread this belief through rumors, jokes, mocking nicknames, etc. Each affected character does so for at least (6 – his [[Integrity]]) days. If Lunar’s instill roll affects the accused, the rumor lives on in his shadow for (Lunar’s extra successes against !!him)days.Anyoneattemptingtoreadhisintentionsisexposed!! to this Charm’s influence, using the original roll’s successes. Such characters use their successes on the read intentions roll in place of their base [[Resolve]], if lower.
