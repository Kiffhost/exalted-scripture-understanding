When you flurry, youâ€™re allowed to take two [[combat actions]] on your turn. However, a character can never flurry two of the same action. Further, when a character flurries, they suffer a -3 [[Dice Rolls#Modifiers|penalty]] to both actions, and a -1 penalty to [[Defense]] until their next turn.

Flurries should be declared before either action is taken (as both actions receive the penalty).
