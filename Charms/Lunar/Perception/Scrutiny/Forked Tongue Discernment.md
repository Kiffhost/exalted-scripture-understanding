*The Lunar can hear the flutter of a liar’s heart or taste dishonesty in his sweat.*
She reflexively reads a character’s intentions with ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Socialize}), adding ([[Essence]]) successes, after he makes a statement. Success reveals whether the statement is a lie, or — if it’s a half-truth — which parts are false. 
Once she’s caught a character lying, the Lunar can use this Charm to test his statements without needing to roll for the rest of the scene. Her target can still resist with effects that would let his [[Guile]] automatically succeed, in which case the Lunar makes an opposed ([[Perception]] + {Investigation or Socialize}) roll with ([[Essence]]) bonus dice.
