*In tomes depicting treasures of the lost Age, the Quincunx is sometimes called the [[Harmonic Crystal Vessel]] for its ability to utilize crystal’s natural resonance to trap sorcerous energy.*
This Evocation supplements a countermagic action (Exalted, p.446), banking dispersed sorcerous motes in the Quincunx. The wearer may use these sorcerous motes to cast her own spells or to power the Quincunx’s [[Evocations]]. Unspent motes are lost at end of scene. 
## Resonant
The countermagic roll benefits from double 9s.
