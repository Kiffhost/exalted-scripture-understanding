While under the effect of at least one of the prerequisites, the Exalt may pay one mote, conjuring phantom images from the Essence of her surroundings. These phantoms coalesce within short range of the Solar, and aid in illustrating her narrative. Apparitions might appear as small animals, person-sized characters, and allusions of scenery in a chiaroscuro. At Performance 5, Essence 3+, the Lawgiver’s apparitions grow larger and more robust. She can depict larger beasts and monsters and more substantial scenery. Phantoms may appear to curl from the smoke of her breath, the light of her eyes, or her very anima.
