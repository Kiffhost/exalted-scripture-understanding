*Tumbling beneath a foe, the stylist sends him sprawling with a sweeping kick or staff-blow.*
A successful disarm or distract gambit knocks its target prone. He loses Initiative equal to the 9s and 10s on the damage roll.
## Mastery
If this crashes the enemy, the gambitâ€™s Initiative cost is refunded.
