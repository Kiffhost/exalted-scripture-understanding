*The Lunar draws forth ancient memories with pristine clarity.*
Reliving her memory of a single scene’s worth of events, she rerolls ([[Essence]]) failed dice on a roll to introduce or challenge a relevant fact, or on any mental Attribute roll that memory is germane to. Alternatively, she can reflexively add +3 non-Charm [[Resolve]] against an effect that would alter her memories or create false memories. With [[Intelligence]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Lunar may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to recall a memory up to ([[Essence]] + [[Intelligence]]) hours in length, such as a lengthy tome’s contents or the events of a drunken revel. Once per story, if she encounters evidence that her memories have been magically manipulated, she may use this Charm with a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to negate that effect.
