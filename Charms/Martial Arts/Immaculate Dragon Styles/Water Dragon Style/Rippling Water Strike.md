The Immaculate’s strike breaks her foe’s guard like a pebble dropped into still water, spreading outward to throw enemies off-balance. Her withering attack gains +2 Overwhelming, and she may use Dexterity in place of Strength to determine its raw damage. If she crashes a nontrivial foe with the attack, all other enemies within close range suffer a −1 onslaught penalty. In Water Aura, the Immaculate adds her Dexterity to raw damage in addition to her Strength.
