*The Infernal’s scriptures twist and coil like serpents, taking on new meanings to ensnare unwitting readers.*

When the Infernal makes a written influence roll with a single target, she may choose a broad category of Intimacies that might support her influence: Ties based on love, Principles involving ethical beliefs, Ties toward demons, Intimacies counter to the prevailing norms of a character’s culture, etc.

If the influence’s target has such an Intimacy, the text of the Infernal’s message shifts and rewrites itself, preserving the substance of her message but presenting it in a way that aligns with that Intimacy. A character can make a difficulty 5 (Perception + {Awareness, Investigation, or Linguistics}) roll to notice the shifting text, which also grants him +1 non-Charm Resolve against the influence.
## [[Keys]]
#### Ever-Changing Epistle (Essence 3)
The Infernal can use this Charm on written influence rolls with multiple targets, requiring her to commit its mote cost indefinitely. Once she ends her commitment, the message no longer shifts for readers, remaining in its most recent iteration.
