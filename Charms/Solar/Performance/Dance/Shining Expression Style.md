*The Exalt’s skill is such that she can condense an entire emotional range into a single dance that embodies its very meaning.*
The Solar must dance for at least two minutes in order to use this Charm, rolling ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes against the group’s [[Resolve]]. If successful, the group is struck with an emotion conveyed by the dance, each member becoming explicitly aware of one [[Intimacy|Tie]] he has which inspires that emotion in him. For instance, if the Solar does a dance that inspires fear, characters recall that which makes them most afraid. If she does a dance which inspires joy, they recall that which brings them the most happiness. If characters do not possess such an [[Intimacy]], the Storyteller may assign one. Affected characters will feel inclined to discuss or act upon their feelings until they are affected by emotional influence that inspires a different mood. Characters who reveal an [[Intimacy]] in this fashion lower their [[Guile]] to 0 for the purposes of detecting and confirming that specific [[Intimacy]]. Note that the Solar is not necessarily going to be the beneficiary of the character’s sudden openness, as she might not be directly involved in the conversation. For all her dancing, the Solar is never seen as the deliberate source of the target’s thoughts. Not even All-Encompassing Sorcerous Sight can reveal the power of this Charm.
