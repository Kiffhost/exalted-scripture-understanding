Having mastered disruption of the five mortal senses, the Dragon-Blood now learns to strike at the spiritual faculty that allows gods and the Exalted to sense and channel Essence. Like its prerequisite, this Charm requires her to touch her target and roll (Manipulation + Awareness) against his Resolve, unmodified by Intimacies. Success seals the target’s Essence. Whenever he spends Essence to use Charms or other magic in a single instant, the total cost is increased by (the Dragon-Blood’s Perception + threshold successes). The seal breaks once the target has paid this surcharge (6 − his Integrity) times, or a day passes.
