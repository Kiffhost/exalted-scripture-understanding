The Dragon-Blood wrestles foes into submission, breaking them with a powerful hold whose intensity and pressure can drown men on dry land. Upon successfully grappling a crashed foe, or crashing an enemy sheâ€™s clinching with a withering savaging attack, she may overflow his lungs with Water Essence, causing him to begin asphyxiating (Exalted, p. 232) and subtracting one success from all actions he takes for as long as she maintains control over the grapple. Even if he recovers from crash, he continues to drown. She may choose not to kill a foe who runs out of breath, leaving him unconscious instead. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully grappling a nontrivial enemy with 5+ threshold successes on the control roll.
