*The Sidereal’s agony is more than she can contain; it spills out through her blows that her enemies might share in it.*
The Sidereal adds (1 + wound penalty) dice of decisive damage and post-soak withering damage on all attacks.
She also adds that many dice on feats of strength, ignoring wound penalties.
If the Sidereal is unarmored, she reduces the cost of Hero’s Iron Skin by one mote.
