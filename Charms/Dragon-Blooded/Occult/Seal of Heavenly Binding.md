*The Terrestrial raises her hand in a devil-sealing mudra, raising a binding circle around a spirit or creature of the Wyld.*
This is a gambit rolled with ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) against the [[Resolve]] of a spirit out to short range. The difficulty of the gambit is equal to (that being’s [[Essence]]). Outside of combat, this Charm only requires the ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll against [[Resolve]] to succeed. On a success, the Dragon-Blood’s anima traces an efficacious sigil that entraps that spirit for a single round, plus an additional round for every two threshold successes on the [[Initiative]] roll (one scene outside of combat). It immediately materializes, if it wasn’t already material, and cannot dematerialize or use the [[Hurry Home]] Charm. It cannot move out of the circle or attack enemies outside it, although those who enter the circle to reach close range are fair game. The bound spirit may use its entire turn to attempt to break out of the circle, spending one [[Willpower]] to make a ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) roll opposing an ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) made by the Dragon-Blood. Success breaches the circle and lets the being escape. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
