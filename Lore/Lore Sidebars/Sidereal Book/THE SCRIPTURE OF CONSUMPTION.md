Once, there was a small maiden…
who climbed a whirlwind over water,
over and over, until she reached the top
and became a mother.
To one child, she said “I have many things to show you.”
And to another, she said “You may rest within my home and eat, no need to fly.”
And to a third, she said “How beautiful you are.” 
And as each heard her words and came to the center of the web, she ate them.
