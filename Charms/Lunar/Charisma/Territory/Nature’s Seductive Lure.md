*The Lunar’s lair is a land of untold splendors and forbidden delights, tempting those who wander it.*
When using [[Captivating Siren Voice]] in a territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]], she may pay an eight-mote, two-anima surcharge to cause that Charm to draw characters toward a specific natural feature within her territory, which radiates silver light as a bonfire anima (p. XX), rather than to her. The Charm’s duration increases to ([[Essence]]) hours. She makes an influence roll as normal, but need not maintain a performance to sustain its effect. Affected characters within medium range of the feature hear unintelligible whispers in the rustling of the leaves and the songs of birds, drawing them irresistibly toward it. Characters may resist for three [[Willpower]], or as per the usual rules for resisting Captivating Siren’s Voice.
