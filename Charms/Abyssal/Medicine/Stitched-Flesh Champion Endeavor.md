*Driven by morbid obsession, the Abyssal surgeon stitches together her magnum opus, an unliving champion greater than the sum of its parts.*
The Abyssal chooses a zombie or similar [[Essence]] 1 animated corpse of her own creation as her undead champion, doing so either as she creates it or after time spent modifying an existing undead. This requires at least a day’s work, in addition to any other time needed to create the champion. The Abyssal gains a Minor Tie of obsession toward her champion, which cannot be reduced below the Minor level for as long as the champion remains.
The champion gains the following benefits:
 - The Abyssal’s Caste Mark glows on its brow. Those familiar with her can recognize her champion as belonging to her with a difficulty 3 ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) roll.
 - The Abyssal adds four dice to one of its dice pools and two dice to its other pools. This can’t raise a pool above fourteen dice.
 - The Abyssal adds +2 to one of its Evasion, Parry, or [[Resolve]], and +1 to the other values. This can’t raise these values above 7.
 - It gains +5 soak and [[Hardness]] (Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + 3).
 - It gains (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) −2 health levels.
 - Its [[Willpower]] increases to five. If it already has [[Willpower]] 5+, it increases by one instead.
 - It can benefit from each of Life-Mocking Assembly’s effects an additional (Abyssal’s Essence/2) times.
 - The Abyssal may spend a scene modifying her champion to replaces a mutation granted by [[Necrotic Graft Technique]] with another mutation of equal or lesser value.
The Abyssal can only have one champion at a time.
