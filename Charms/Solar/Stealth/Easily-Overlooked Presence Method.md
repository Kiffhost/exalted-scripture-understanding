The Lawgiver evades detection by hiding in plain sight. A Solar with this Charm is able to drift unnoticed through crowds or alone. This Charm models her talent for blending in and remaining unobtrusive. When active, characters cannot notice her unless she takes overt action. Such actions include any display of prowess—leaping from the street to the rooftops, braving a snowstorm in summer clothes, etc. Join Battle always counts as an overt action. This skill does not work against alert guards or those who intend to stop everyone (as with a checkpoint), but can be overcome by magic only if the user has a Minor or greater Intimacy to the Solar or a Major or Defining Intimacy to a cause the Exalt’s presence directly threatens. Certain Charms may aid in detecting the Exalt. Roll the Lawgiver’s ([Wits or Dexterity] + Stealth) against her opponent’s relevant (Attribute + Ability) or Resolve, if the attacking Charm is based on the opponent’s Integrity.
