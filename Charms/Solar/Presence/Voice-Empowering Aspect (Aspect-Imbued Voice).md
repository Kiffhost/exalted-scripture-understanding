Channeling the fullness of her presence briefly, the Lawgiver passes her divine aspect into another. The Exalt may only use this Charm on a character enhanced by the prerequisite. The enhanced character must also possess [[Charisma]] 3+ and [[Presence]] 3+ to receive this power. This Charm adds three motes to the prophet’s mote pool and grants them a Charm called Divine Aspect, a one mote reflexive Charm that grants them one automatic success to a [[Presence]] roll to social influence that is an accordance with one of the Solar’s Defining Principles. This Charm confers knowledge of a single such [[Intimacy]]; if the [[Intimacy]] is already known, this Charm confirms it as the Solar commands her prophet to go forth and be righteous and just according to her wishes. Divine Aspect may also be used to reflexively raise the prophet’s [[Resolve]] by one. Lastly, whenever the prophet uses Divine Aspect to rebuke or command one who has transgressed against the Solar, the Lawgiver senses it and may pay one mote, one [[Willpower]] to cause the prophet to blaze with her glory, lit up with Solar anima. Wreathed in flame, the prophet’s mien appears as the Solar’s, and the prophet speaks with the Solar’s voice, and the Solar may inhabit her prophet’s form, using them as a vessel for her own [[Presence]] and [[Integrity]] [[Charms]] for ([[Essence]]) rounds. The Solar can use her prophet’s senses and can control their gestures, but this does not confer the Solar sensory control necessary for [[Awareness]] or [[Investigation]], or the ability to fight using her prophet’s body. The Solar pays the cost of any [[Presence]] or [[Integrity]] [[Charms]] used on her prophet’s behalf. 

### On Voice-Empowering Aspect (Aspect-Imbued Voice)

The backer requested a Charm that would allow a Solar to suffuse a follower with her sacred and divine presence so that they might go forth in the Solar’s name like a prophet of old and do battle with evil. He specifically mentioned the conferring of power from Elijah to Elisha and gave the sense that he wanted to confront evil ideas through social influence rather than through violence.
