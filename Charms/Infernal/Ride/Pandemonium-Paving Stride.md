*The roads of Hell present themselves before the Infernal’s steed wherever she may ride.*

A basalt road forms beneath the Infernal’s mount as it moves, increasing its Speed bonus by +1. The road covers whatever the mount passes over, potentially bypassing difficult terrain and environmental hazards from the surface it crosses over. This only works if there’s a solid surface for the mount to move over, and can’t be used to move up or down a surface unless the mount could do so normally. The road shatters once the scene ends — unless the Infernal uses [[Basalt-Cracking Step]] to destroy it immediately. Other characters can use it to navigate difficult terrain, but don’t gain the Speed bonus.
## [[Keys]]
#### Causeway-Carving Hoofbeats (Ride 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal can ride over liquid surfaces and even thin air, forming a bridge beneath her mount. She must renew this Charm on each turn until she reaches her destination or fall as the unanchored bridge collapses. She can also move vertically, creating angled slopes, ramps, and the like, but no higher than short range above the ground, which don’t require continued use of this Charm to maintain.
#### Prince-Upon-the-Tower Ascent ([[#Causeway-Carving Hoofbeats (Ride 5, Essence 3)|Causeway-Carving Hoofbeats]]) (4m per range band)
The Infernal can ascend vertically up to long range on, but must pay four motes each time she moves a range band higher than short range from the ground.
#### Ginnungagap-Bridging Endeavor (Ride 5, Essence 3) (+1m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene.
