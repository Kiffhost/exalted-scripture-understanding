*Death’s Lawgiver subtly weaves appreciation for the proper forms of society into her performance.*
When the Abyssal makes an [[inspire]] or [[instill]] roll, it also counts as a roll to [[instill]] a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward a culture or society or a [[Intimacy|Principle]] involving a tradition, cultural practice, philosophical movement, or the like. Her performance must reflect the [[Intimacy]] instilled. This fails if the target has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that directly opposes the instilled [[Intimacy]].
If the Abyssal instills a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to a culture that’s now dead or that consists primarily of the undead, her target is immune only if he has an opposed Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]]. She also gains this benefit when instilling a [[Intimacy|Principle]] involving a custom or belief related to death or from a culture that’s either dead or undead.
