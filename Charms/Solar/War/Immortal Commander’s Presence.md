By drilling with a ballista squad, catapult crew, or other team of siege weaponry operators, the Lawgiver burns an image of perfect actions into their minds. This simple action can last for one minute or one hour. The Solar drills her charges in loading, aiming, and firing siege weaponry and ballistae, giving each crewman an automatic success on the firing roll, and allowing him to reroll all non-successes. If she drills the crew for one minute, they gain this benefit for a single attack. If she drills them for an hour, they gain it for an entire combat scene.
