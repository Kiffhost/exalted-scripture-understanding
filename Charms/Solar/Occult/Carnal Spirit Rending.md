Upon destroying a spirit with Ghost-Eating Technique, the Solar may activate this Charm to draw the rent and torn Essence of the spirit into her limbs and through her chakras, embodying it. For the rest of the scene, the Exalt gains (Essence) powers or traits based on the Charms and themes of the destroyed spirit, to be decided by the Storyteller. This power explicitly allows the Solar to utilize magic effects that cannot be learned through the Eclipse anima power, but the Exalt may not take powers with a prerequisite higher than ([Solarâ€™s Essence] + 2).
