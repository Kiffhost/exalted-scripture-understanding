The Childe of Nightmares Unremembered creates itself from errant scraps of dream and from fantasies torn from its prey, forging its legend like a bird building a nest. The wearer may learn raksha [[Charms]] with the [[Eclipse]] Keyword from willing teachers for eight experience points each.
Additionally, upon accomplishing a major character or story goal by defeating a raksha — in combat, intrigue, or some other venue — the wearer may instantly learn one of his [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]], going into experience debt if necessary. She can’t benefit from this effect while already in experience debt.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens at no cost once the wearer meets its prerequisites.
