Normally, this artifact seems nothing more than a footlong, finger-thick wooden tube. Closer examination shows one end is rimmed in red jade, the other in blue, while the shaft itself — cut from the timeless Liar’s Tree south of Lake Grayglass — is inscribed with minuscule sigils in an unknown tongue. Requiring no attunement, its bearer can manipulate it in many ways. Used as a snorkel, it automatically adjusts its length between one and six feet to match the swimmer’s depth, keeping out waves and spray. Used as a breathing tube or straw, it halves the duration of airborne or ingested toxins. One may even twist it to reveal holes allowing its use as an exceptional flute (Exalted, p. 580).

But the tube is also a weapon. With a simple tug, its bearer can stretch it to six feet to serve as a mundane staff. Stretched to three feet, it becomes a mundane blowgun; the Exalt spends one mote and blows to create and fire a poisoned needle. Blowing from the blue end creates curare-coated darts; from the red, darts coated in arrow frog venom.
