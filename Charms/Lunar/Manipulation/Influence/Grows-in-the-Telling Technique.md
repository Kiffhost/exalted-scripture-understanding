Even the wildest lies grow more believable with repetition. The Lunar resets a failed instill roll to convince others of a falsehood. If a target uses the same Intimacy to bolster his Resolve against her renewed roll that he did against the original roll, reduce the bonus it applies by one. Any penalties the Lunar suffers for dubious claims on the renewed roll are halved. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
