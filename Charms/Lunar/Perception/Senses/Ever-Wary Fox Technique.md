The Lunar faces many foes and perils, cultivating a keen instinct for danger. She adds a non-Charm success on a roll opposing [[Stealth]] or to detect a hidden peril such as a trap, poisoned drink, or approaching storm. She may use this Charm to make such [[Perception]] rolls while asleep or incapacitated, removing any penalty she might suffer from such states, including that of [[Bear Sleep Technique]]. She may awaken instantly upon successfully detecting a threat, or even revive herself from unconsciousness if incapacitated, though she still suffers the effects of incapacitation.
