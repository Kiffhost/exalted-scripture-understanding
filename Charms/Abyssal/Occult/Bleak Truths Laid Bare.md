*Refining her sense for the subtle and sublime, the Abyssal sees the world in an austere black and white, colored only by the flow of [[Essence]].*
The Abyssal can perceive dematerialized characters and the boundaries between Creation and other worlds, like the edge of a shadowland or the entrance to a spirit’s sanctum. She can roll ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) to identify a spell being shaped or an Evocation in use, at a difficulty of that effect’s minimum [[Essence]]. She can detect the presence of ongoing spells and workings and identify their function without a roll.
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal adds ([[Essence]]) successes on [[Awareness]] rolls to see through magical disguises, shapeshifting, or any other form of magical that conceals a character’s true appearance, and always roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) to see through such deceptions. If an effect doesn’t provide a difficulty to contest it, the Abyssal treats it as difficulty 5.
