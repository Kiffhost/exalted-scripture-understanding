*Oadenol ensured that Sagacious Sloth could always be on time, though even she couldn’t force him to.*
Meeting a deadline with [[Yellow Path]] counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX). Passing on an opportunity to do so is met with disapproving whinnies from the lumenir. Once per day, the Sidereal can add a free full Excellency, including target number reduction, on a roll to do so. 
## Special activation rules
This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience. It awakens for free when the Sidereal misses a deadline.
