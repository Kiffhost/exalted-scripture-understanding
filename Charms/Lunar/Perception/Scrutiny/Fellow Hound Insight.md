*The Lunar’s insight traces webs of interrelation, revealing friends and foes of any stolen face she might wear.*
She rolls read intentions with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes to determine if a character knows a specific person whose shape she possesses and any Ties he has toward that person. This roll succeeds automatically unless opposed by magic. 
With [[Perception]] 4, the Lunar may use this Charm without a specific person in mind to determine if a character knows any person whose shape she possesses, learning that person’s identity and her target’s [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward him on a success. If the target knows multiple people, the Storyteller chooses which one is revealed.
