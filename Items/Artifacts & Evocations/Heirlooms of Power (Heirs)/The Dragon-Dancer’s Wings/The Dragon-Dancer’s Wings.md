Once, the air dragon Rekal, a diligent censor, found himself at odds with the fire dragon Banu, an indolent spirit who shirked his duties to luxuriate in splendor. The two quarreled and ultimately fought, and in the end a victorious Rekal feasted on Banu’s fiery [[Essence]]. He’d thought to use that power to fulfill the fire dragon’s responsibilities as well as his own, but the smoldering remnants of Banu’s spirit overwhelmed Rekal, driving him to unrestrained fury.
The dancer-diplomat Nalako Jathri learned of Rekal’s plight. Some of her Sworn Kin argued that they should slay the tormented dragon, but Jathri spoke against it, fearful of what havoc a battle might wreak upon a land still struggling to establish itself. Instead, she sought out two famed smiths, sisters with clashing temperaments, and secretly commissioned one fan from each. The jade she provided came from two veins within the same mountain, one red, the other blue. From these emblems of division and reunion, the Dragon-Dancer’s [[Wings]] were forged.
It was no difficult thing to find the berserk Rekal along his path of destruction. Wielding the [[Wings]], Jathri danced alongside Rekal — when he breathed out tempest winds, she whirled within them; when he spat flame, she promenaded through the smoke. Some of her Hearth stood beside her, fending off Rekal’s claws and fangs; the others worked to draw a great binding diagram about him. Finally, the dance drew to its close, and the circle was completed. The ritual’s power brought peace to the warring Essences of Banu and Rekal, and from their union was born a new dragon of air and fire.
Jathri’s lineage was brought into the [[Scarlet Dynasty]] centuries later as part of the newly formed House Jurul, along with the Dragon-Dancer’s [[Wings]]. When the Empress struck Jurul from the Imperial ledgers for its founder’s treachery, Jathri’s descendants were among those cast out, while the remainder was reborn as House Ledaal.
For centuries, they languished in relative obscurity as a patrician family, but when the Empress elevated House V’neef, they were among the outcastes brought into its fold, bringing their treasured heirloom with them.
[[The Dragon-Dancer’s Wings]] are a matched pair of jade war fans named for the dragons. Etched into the folded face of the red jade fan are designs of garda birds in flight, curling orange flame trailing behind them. The blue jade fan is coated with rime that creeps along its ribs like a frozen delta, winged serpents gliding across its leaves. In battle or in dance, the patterns come alight, giving off wisps of fire and ice.
