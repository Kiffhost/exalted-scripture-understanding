*The world will not betray its servant; infernos and hurricanes know her as a friend.*
The Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Survival) against the difficulty of an environmental hazard within long range. If the hazard was created by a character’s magic, he makes an opposing (Attribute + Ability) roll; the Sidereal must beat both the hazard’s difficulty and the opposed roll.
If successful, the Sidereal wins over the hazard. She may have it move one range band in any direction. It won’t damage her or anyone or anything else she chooses for the rest of the scene.  Alternatively, the Sidereal makes a (Charisma + Survival) persuade roll against an elemental or spirit associated with an element or the wilderness. The spirit can’t use negative Ties to the Sidereal to bolster his Resolve, and the influence costs an additional Willpower to resist.
