*The Sidereal brings Jupiter’s disfavor against her victim, snarling his fate in secret matters.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Manipulation]] + Secrets Ability) opposing her target’s ([[Perception]] + Secrets Ability) roll. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one [[Willpower]] for others. Success inflicts misfortune on his efforts to keep or uncover a secret. A curse on a character’s efforts to keep a secret grants −1 target number on rolls against his [[Guile]] that would reveal it and inflicts +1 target number on his [[Manipulation]] and [[Larceny]] rolls to conceal it. A curse on efforts to uncover a secret inflicts +1 target number on relevant [[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], [[Lore]], [[Occult]], and read intentions rolls. Cursing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options. Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. Baleful Phantom Harbinger (The Mask): The Sidereal observes her target without him being aware of her. Hubris-Punishing Downfall (The Sorcerer): The Sidereal’s target disrespects, insults, or expresses feelings of superiority to a supernatural being. Nine Lives Extinguished (The Key): The Sidereal’s target tries to uncover a secret she’s keeping, her nature as a Sidereal, or details about her personal life she doesn’t want to share with him. Serpent-Strangling Malison (The Guardians): The Sidereal’s target lies to her or tries to cheat or take advantage of her. Willful Ignorance Reward (The Treasure Trove): The Sidereal’s target ignores advice he sought from her about intellectual pursuits, useful information to pursue, or the application of knowledge. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively. The Sidereal can curse multiple characters with this Charm.
