The Doom of Tamokhet spreads insidiously, turning family against family and friend against friend. The wielder can pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Sting of Betrayal to render the Doom of Tamokhet contagious. The next time her victim interacts with a nontrivial character with a positive Tie toward him, that character is exposed to the Doom. 

## Resonant

With an Essence 3 repurchase, for each success by which the victim failed his roll against the Doom’s virulence, another potential target he interacts with must roll against the Doom.
