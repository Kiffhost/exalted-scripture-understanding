One of the greatest sailing vessels ever built amid the First Age’s shipyards, the legendary warship *Horizon Endeavor* has appeared in naval wars and odysseys throughout Creation’s history, and vanished from history’s pages just as often. The pirate-empress Zala Firemane sailed it into battle against the hell-leviathan Rahabaris, which the Lintha Armada had called forth to torment the West. Laughing Mirror wove fate to reshape the rivers of Diamond Grass Province so that *Horizon Endeavor* could fight at the Battle of Five Suns. More recent legends claim that the Lunar elder Leviathan or the [[Scarlet Empress]] herself piloted it against the dread fae prince Balor, but these tales are as preposterous as those that claim it dates back to the Niobraran [[War]]. 

*Horizon Endeavor* is a triple-masted ship of the line, but its resemblance to seafaring vessels of the [[Time]] of Tumult is like that of the eagle to the hen. Its hull is orichalcum-clad yet light enough to float gracefully over waves, while its masts are carved from indestructible timbers felled at the Old Realm’s Easternmost edge and rigged with sails spun from cloth-of-jade. The ship’s lowest decks house a marvelous device capable of drawing in water through a spiral of black jade blades to propel the ship forward even in a dead calm. Hatches along the side of its hull spring open to reveal red jade dragon cannons capable of setting entire fleets ablaze, while the ship’s tidecutter bolts soar silently beneath the sea to sink enemy ships.

# Cargo

*Horizon Endeavor* can carry up to 300 men in its below-decks barracks, and has cargo holds capable of carrying several thousand tons. Some legends claim the cargo holds can bear any weight that will fit within them, such as the tale of Cormorant Black smuggling away the entire seraglio-palace of the Four Corners Suzerain, but these are most likely exaggerations.

# Integrated Armaments

## Red Jade Dragon Cannons

When the prayers inscribed on these ornate jade dragon-statues are recited aloud, they spew great gouts of flame, setting enemy ships ablaze. Three of them line each side of the ship, with a seventh on the bow. A broadside with the dragon cannons deals one point of hull damage and sets wooden ships ablaze, rolling an additional die of hull damage against them at the end of each round. A captain can direct her crew to put out the fires as a special naval stratagem rolled with ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]) that costs two Momentum. If that ship’s captain loses the opposed roll for that stratagem, the ship remains aflame, although it doesn’t take damage from the fire that round. Outside of naval combat, the cannons are siege engines with the Lethal, Siege (Long), and Bombard tags. 

## Tidecutter Bolts

Spiked steel bolts carved with spiraling grooves, tidecutter bolts twist through the water like augers when fired from the pressurized cylinders of orichalcum-banded steel mounted under the ship’s bow below the water line. A broadside with tidecutter bolts deals two points of hull damage. Bonus dice added by a prior [[Concealment]] stratagem are converted to successes on the broadside stratagem roll, as the bolts launch silently and almost invisibly under the water. Horizon Endeavor’s armory holds a vast but finite store of bolts. If the Storyteller deems them exhausted after multiple naval battles over the course of the story, she may require a major repair project to restock its supply.
