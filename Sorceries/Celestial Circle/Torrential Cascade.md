*The sorcerer sings in meaningless glossolalia that evokes the Storm Who Drowned the World.*
A churning pillar of water forms above her, drawn from nearby lakes and rivers, deep aquifers, and the clouds themselves. It then collapses in a great wave, engulfing a 90-degree arc out to short range. This is a difficulty ([[Intelligence]]), damage 1B environmental hazard. Battle groups that fail their roll against the hazard check for rout (Exalted, p. 209). Mundane structures less than one range band high and similar inanimate objects suffer [[uncountable damage]] (Exalted, p. 205) at the Storyteller’s discretion, as the wave uproots trees, crushes stone buildings, and washes away fields. Characters caught in the wave suffer a –3 penalty on rolls other than those against the hazard.
Once the sorcerer’s begun casting, she can sustain the spell with an unrolled [[Shape Sorcery]] action each turn at no cost, causing the wave to advance another range band, maximum three consecutive rounds. Characters who failed their roll on her previous turn are dragged along. If it caused significant structural damage, the hazard’s damage increases by one die each subsequent round from the debris caught in the wave. Some circumstances, like being dammed by a structure too sturdy to break, may block it, in which case it’s redirected in one or more different directions, at the Storyteller’s discretion. The sorcerer can’t continue sustaining the spell if she takes any movement actions.
Once the sorcerer ceases sustaining the wave or is crashed, it collapses, drenching the ground with water. Earthen surfaces caught in the spell’s area become difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) until they dry out; the Storyteller dictates how the water behaves on other surfaces, which may include drowning those unable to escape.
## Control Spell
A sorcerer with this as her control spell can guide and shape the wave as it moves. She can cause it to change direction in mid-course, flow around obstacles, or split and harmlessly flow around certain characters or structures. When she experiences strong emotions, nearby bodies of water become agitated, furiously roiling and churning.
## Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
Distorting the wave causes it to flow harmlessly around the distorting sorcerer and anyone within close range of him for the duration. This can be accomplished even by a sorcerer already engulfed in the wave.
