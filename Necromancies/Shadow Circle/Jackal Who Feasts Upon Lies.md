*Speaking the first half of a truth abhorrent to the Gaoler of Uqad, the necromancer lures and binds one of that tyrant’s enormous jackals, trained in the Gaoler’s sand-drenched holdfast to feast on the meat of deceivers.*
The necromancer conjures one of the Jackals Who Feast Upon Lies. It has an Defining Tie of loyalty to the necromancer which can’t be broken or degraded. It serves faithfully for seven days, after which it returns to the Gaoler with news of the world and its secrets.
The [[Jackal Who Feasts Upon Lies]] PLEASE FORMAT AS QUICK CHARACTER IN A SIDEBAR Each of the Gaoler of Uqad’s jackals is a sinewy, undead canine six feet tall, with long, sleek limbs, jagged yellow fangs, and griseous fur wrapped in bloodblackened bandages. They can speak in stilted Old [[Realm]], punctuated by cruel laugher. The jackals abhor deception, and are employed by the Gaoler (and necromancers) to detect and punish liars.
[[Essence]]: 5; [[Willpower]]: 5; [[Join Battle]]: 11 dice Personal Motes: 100 Health Levels: −0x4/−1x4/−2x4/−4x2/Incap.
Actions: Intimidation: 12 dice; Senses: 12 dice; [[Read Intentions]]: 12 dice; Resist Poison/Disease: 8 dice; [[Tracking]] 12 dice.
[[Appearance]] 2 ([[Hideous]]), [[Resolve]] 5, [[Guile]] 5 Combat [[Attack]] (Bite): 14 dice (Damage 14L/3) [[Attack]] (Grapple): 8 dice (8 dice to control) Combat [[Movement]]: 12 dice Evasion: 6; Parry: 3 Soak/Hardness: 8/8 Intimacies Defining Principle: Liars are the tastiest prey.
Defining Tie: The Gaoler of Uqad (Loyalty) Major Tie: Raw meat, red and bloody (Desire) [[Merits]] Scent of Falsehood: Double 8s on rolls to detect lies, pierce illusions, or spot disguises.
Offensive [[Charms]] Razored Confession Smile (8m, 1wp; Supplemental; Instant; Decisive-only): After a successful decisive attack roll, the target must either confess a significant deception they’ve made or else suffer five additional dice of decisive damage. The confession should be what is most relevant to the scene or necromancer; if the [[Storyteller]] doesn’t have one in mind, they should ask players for suggestions.
Once per scene.
Shadow-Seizing Jaws (10m; Supplemental; Instant): The jackal attacks a known but unseen enemy within close range, whether invisible, in concealment, etc. Any penalty it suffers from this is halved, rounded down, and it adds (necromancer’s [[Essence]]) dice on the attack roll. It can strike dematerialized targets.
Defensive [[Charms]] Dancing Among Serpents (6m [+1wp]; Reflexive; Instant; Uniform): The jackal adds (necromancer’s [[Essence]]) Evasion and reduces penalties to [[Defense]] by three.
For one [[Willpower]], it may also negate the penalties of an ambush or surprise attack.
Swift-Shadowed Guardian (5m; Reflexive; Instant): The jackal reflexively takes a defend other action to protect its rider, using Evasion instead of Parry.
Mobility [[Charms]] Loyal Predator Saddle (10m, 1wp; Simple; Indefinite): The jackal grows and elongates to bear up to (necromancer’s [[Essence]] + 3) riders. It adds one automatic success on movement actions.
Social [[Charms]] Laughing at [[Calumny]] (10m; Reflexive; Instant): Gain +(necromancer’s [[Essence]]) [[Resolve]] and ignore all [[Resolve]] penalties against social influence meant to deceive or disguise. Compare the influence roll to the jackal’s [[Resolve]] before those of other characters; on success, its hideous laughter grants all other characters +2 [[Resolve]] against that influence.
Weight-of-Sin Excoriation (15m; Reflexive; Instant): After successfully resisting influence meant to deceive the hound or its master, it makes an Intimidation roll, penalizing the liar’s [[Resolve]] by the difference between their attempted influence and the jackal’s [[Resolve]]. On success, the target must flee the scene or admit their crime and beg forgiveness. Resisting requires entering a Decision Point and citing a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] to pay two [[Willpower]]. Once per scene.
