The wilderness welcomes the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s presence, recognizing her as a Prince of the Earth. She may add automatic successes to a [[Survival]] roll for two motes each. If she enhances a roll to forage for food, it yields enough edible plants or game to feed a single additional character besides her for one day per threshold success.
