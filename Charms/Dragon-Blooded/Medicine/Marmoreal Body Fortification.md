Alabaster anima limns the Dragon-Blood’s hands as she massages her patient’s pressure points and meridians, causing his flesh to take on a pale, marble-like hue as the strength of stone suffuses it. She rolls (Essence) dice, granting her patient a single temporary −0 health level for each success. Damage is applied to these temporary levels before the patient’s own health levels, and any damage filling them is removed along with them when this Charm ends. In addition, if the patient is unarmored, his stony skin adds (the Dragon-Blood’s Essence) to his natural soak and grants 2 Hardness. Normally, only one character may benefit from this Charm at a time. However, the Dragon-Blood may sustain multiple uses to empower herself and her Sworn Kin with it.
