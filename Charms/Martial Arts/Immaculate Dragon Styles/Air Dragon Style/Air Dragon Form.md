*The Immaculate’s hands cut through the air as she executes a rapid kata and draws a deep cleansing breath, respiring the [[Essence]] of the Air Dragon.*
Her withering [[Chakram]] attacks are treated as made from [[Range|close range]] to determine their [[Accuracy]] bonus, regardless of the actual distance. She gains +1 [[Defense|Evasion]], and adds an automatic success on disengage rolls and [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] rolls.
## Special activation rules 
When the Immaculate deals enough withering damage to lower a foe’s [[Initiative]] from a rating higher than her own to a lower rating, she may reflexively enter this Form.
