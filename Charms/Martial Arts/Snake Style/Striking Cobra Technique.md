The snake claims its victory not by striking hardest, but by striking first. Against an enemy with lower Initiative or who hasn’t taken their turn yet this round, Striking Cobra Technique adds the martial artist’s Dexterity to the raw damage of a withering attack, or one die to the raw damage of a decisive attack. Against enemies in Initiative Crash, the withering damage boost is added after soak, while the decisive damage boost is converted to an automatic success. 

## Mastery

Add the martial artist’s (Essence + 2) to her Initiative when determining if she can use this Charm against an enemy.
