*The Dragon-Blood unleashes her gathered fury in a storm of deadly steel.*
She instantly recalls every weapon she’s banished with [[Invisibly Hidden [[Chakram]] Method]] and sends them flying towards a single foe. She makes a decisive attack with her readied weapon (if any) and with each recalled weapon, making a separate attack roll for each weapon. She divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among all attacks, rounded down, to determine their damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. She doesn’t reset to base [[Initiative]] until she’s completed all attacks.
