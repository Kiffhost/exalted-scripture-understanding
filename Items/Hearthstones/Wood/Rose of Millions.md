This hearthstone appears as an eight-sided pink and black tourmaline cross-section. When placed in an attuned hearthstone socket, the bearer may enshrine one of her
Major or Defining Intimacies in the gem as she falls asleep by spending four motes. Thereafter, she automatically knows when she perceives another character who shares that same [[Intimacy]], though she doesnâ€™t learn what intensity they hold the [[Intimacy]] at. The [[Rose of Millions]] can only hold one [[Intimacy]] at a time.
