*The Infernal’s eyes glint with the faintest of flickering green flames, bearing witness to cosmic truths.*

The Infernal can perceive dematerialized characters and the boundaries between Creation and other worlds, like the entrance to a spirit’s sanctum. She can roll (Intelligence + Occult) to identify a spell being shaped or an Evocation in use, at a difficulty of that effect’s minimum Essence. She can detect the presence of ongoing spells and workings and identify their function without a roll.

When the Infernal adds a success on a roll from [[Hundred Devil Gaze]], she also adds (Essence) additional non-Charm dice. However, she suffers a penalty of (Essence) on any Perception rolls she makes to detect or examine mortals.

Nontrivial characters can attempt a difficulty 5 (Perception + Awareness) roll to notice the subtle green flame that flickers in the Infernal’s eyes when she uses this Charm.
## [[Keys]]
#### Dim Irrelevancies Unveiled (Essence 3)
The Infernal adds (Essence) successes on Awareness rolls to see through magical disguises, shapeshifting, or any other form of magical that conceals a character’s true appearance. She can always roll (Perception + Awareness) to see through such deceptions. If an effect doesn’t provide a difficulty to contest it, the Infernal treats it as difficulty 5.
