The Sidereal’s shadow rises from the earth, embracing her gently as it splinters into countless thorns of darkness that encircle her hands and limbs. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  She ignores penalties for flurrying attacks with movement actions. 
-  At the start of each of her turns, her shadow-thorns inflict (Essence, maximum 5) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness, on enemies within close range. Enemies who hit her with unarmed or natural attacks also suffer this damage. It’s aggravated against the undead. 
-  Against the undead, her decisive attacks add (Essence, maximum 5) damage dice. 
-  She’s immune to magic that affects her shadow. 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal can enter this Form reflexively when she succeeds on a disengage roll with 5+ total successes.
