The Lunar bends her enemyâ€™s magic to her will, breaking the power of lesser sorcerers to bolster her own.
The Lunar doubles 8s on a roll to counter or distort a spell (Exalted, p. 466) or to weaken, disrupt, or interfere with a spell, sorcerous working, or curse. Successfully countering or distorting a spell or otherwise ending such an effect awards ([[Essence]]) sorcerous motes, which last for one scene.
Alternatively, the Lunar can use this Charm with SpellRending Talon, increasing each level of damage to counting as three successes of distortion. She can gain sorcerous motes as above.
