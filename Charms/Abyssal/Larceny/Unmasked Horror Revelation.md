*As the masquerade comes to its close, the Abyssal reveals the horror hidden behind her mask.*
When the Abyssal removes a disguise, she makes an ({Appearance or Manipulation} + Presence) threaten roll against any number of characters who can perceive her, ignoring multiple target penalties. She can’t target characters who’ve already seen through her disguise.
The Willpower cost to resist is increased by one. In combat, affected characters also lose (Abyssal’s Essence) Initiative and can’t spend Willpower to resist if crashed.
If the Abyssal used a disguise to impersonate someone, characters with positive Ties to that person suffer their Intimacy’s Resolve penalty against the deathknight’s influence. They must pay an additional point of Willpower to resist.
If the Abyssal knows Flickering Shadow Masquerade, she can use this Charm to reveal herself in only the briefest of flickers rather than removing her disguises.
Nontrivial characters may make a roll against her disguise to clearly see her true appearance.
