*A great fist of ancient bone bursts from the ground, arranging itself into a dolorous throne fit for a lord of the dead.*
While seated on it, the necromancer gains the following benefits against characters who can perceive her
- She gains a bonus dot of Appearance and may choose to gain or suppress the Hideous Merit (Exalted, p. 162).
- She adds (Essence/2, rounded up) non-Charm dice on influence rolls based on awe, fear, or envy.
- Characters who wish to approach within short range of her must spend one Willpower to do so.
- In combat, characters with Ties of awe, fear, or envy treat the pressure of her majesty as an environmental hazard extending out to short range. It has difficulty (Appearance), Damage accompanied by a wordless susurrus. The necromancer rolls (Intelligence + Occult) roll against the ghost’s Resolve to bind it.
Success lets the necromancer impose a Defining Tie of loyalty to her for a year and a day that cannot be weakened or altered by any means. Alternatively, she may assign a task and a Defining Principle of “I must complete my task.” If the necromancer fails, the ghost escapes back through the portal and cannot be bound for the rest of the story.
By default, the summoned ghost is a typical member of the “type” of undead to which it belongs (e.g., honored ancestor, mortwight, war ghost). To summon a specific ghost, the necromancer must know his name or identity and possess a symbolic link to him, like a piece of his corpse, a treasured keepsake, or grave goods.
