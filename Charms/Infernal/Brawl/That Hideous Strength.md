*The Infernal’s monstrous might overwhelms her foe’s defenses, striking shields aside and outpacing attempts at evasion.*

The Infernal can use Strength instead of Dexterity on unarmed attacks and attacks with heavy weapons, as well as to calculate her Parry with such weapons. This doesn’t benefit from effects that grant bonus Strength dots, double successes on Strength rolls, or replace her Strength with a higher value.
