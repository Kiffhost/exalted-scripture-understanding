Even the meekest hearts are tinderboxes for the flames of outrage the Dragon-Blood stirs. She rolls to inspire a single character with anger. If successful, her target must immediately respond to her with hostility. His player chooses the form this takes â€” outrage, threats, or even Joining Battle. In combat, this influence roll instead provokes an enemy into prioritizing attacking the Dragon-Blood instead of any of her allies on his next turn. Even if he does pay the Willpower cost to resist, he loses two Initiative if he attacks any other character that turn.
