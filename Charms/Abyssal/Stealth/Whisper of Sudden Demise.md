*The deathknight vanishes even as she strikes, leaving her remaining victims to guess at which of them is next.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Massacre-Prolonging Cruelty]], she vanishes into a blind spot in her enemies’ defense, causing the next unexpected attack she makes to become an ambush (Exalted, p. 203).
She loses this benefit if she doesn’t make an unexpected attack in the next ([[Essence]]) rounds.
