The Immaculate is a deadly whirlwind, scything down foes with a spinning strike. The Immaculate chooses a range band within her weapon’s range and rolls a single decisive attack against all enemies at that range from her — she might deliver a spinning kick to all enemies in close range, or send a chakram flying to strike all enemies at medium range. If she wishes to attack at medium range or further, she must first spend a round aiming, as usual. The player rolls (Initiative/3, rounded up) dice of damage againsteachhitenemy,plus(Perception)diceagainsteach enemy against whom the attack was unexpected.
