The Lunar shifts between weapons like flowing quicksilver, unleashing a barrage with bow and blade.
The Lunar may pay a two-mote, two-[[Initiative]] surcharge when she uses [[Wasp Sting Blur]], replacing its special attack with a normal withering or decisive attack. She adds her enemy’s onslaught penalty as dice of raw withering damage or decisive damage. The Lunar must use a different combat Ability than her first attack and can reflexively ready a weapon to do so. If she makes an [[Archery]] attack, she counts as attacking from short range.
