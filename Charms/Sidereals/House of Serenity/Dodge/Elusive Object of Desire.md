*Wreathed in the fate of desires unfulfilled, the Sidereal is pursued by those who cannot touch her.*
The Sidereal gains +1 Evasion against an attack. If she successfully dodges, she counterattacks with an (Appearance + Dodge) instill roll to create a Tie of infatuation toward her. She isn’t perceived as the source of this influence. Against enemies with Defining Ties of infatuation toward the Sidereal, a successful counterattack lets her steal (higher of her Essence or 3) Initiative from them.
If the Sidereal’s roll beats her target’s Resolve, her attacker must use his next turn to move toward her (if not already at close range) and attack her. If attacking the Sidereal isn’t possible, he can take another action, but can’t attack anyone but her. This costs one Willpower to resist. Spending Willpower to resist the instill roll doesn’t negate this influence, or vice versa.
