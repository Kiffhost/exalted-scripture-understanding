The land gives its strength to the Lawgiver. The Solar may use this Charm to make a ([Charisma or Wits] + Survival) roll against a difficulty assigned by the Storyteller. Each extra success on this roll represents enough food gathered to feed a single person for a day. The fare guaranteed by this Charm is of a meager sort—berries, grubs, nuts, seeds, insects, and small animals—but the Solar has no need of a spear or bow or net to hunt such game. If the Storyteller decides there simply isn’t any sort of sustenance in the region, or the player fails the roll, the Solar still finds enough food to feed at least one person. In addition, for every hour the Solar continues to use this Charm, the Solar works toward a climactic encounter with the rawest expression of survivalist skill possible. This guarantees that after repeated use, the Solar will have at least one chance per day to catch a large fish, kill a game animal, trap a large bird or find a fruit-bearing tree. This encounter will happen regardless of Storyteller decree, but is still contingent on a difficulty 6 roll in the worst case scenario.
