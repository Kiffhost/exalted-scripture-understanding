*Many stand against the Infernal. Their opposition is prayer to her.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- She gains +1 Evasion. This is non-Charm if she’s unarmoured.
- She ignores onslaught penalties to her Evasion, and reduces other penalties by (higher of Essence or 3).
- Enemy battle groups don’t receive benefits from their Size on attack rolls against her.
- She gains one mote when she dodges a decisive attack, maximum once per round.

This Charm ends if a round goes by without the Infernal moving at least one range band or successfully rushing an enemy.
