*There is stillness. And then storm.*

The Infernal makes (lowest of Dexterity, Stamina, or Wits) decisive attacks against one or more enemies. She can divide her Initiative among attacks however she wishes for their damage, minimum one per attack. She resets to base Initiative after completing all attacks if any of them hit. She may move a single range band before each attack, maximum (higher of Essence or 3) range bands.

After making these attacks, the Infernal may reflexively make a rush roll against an enemy she hit from close range during this flurry, adding a non-Charm success on the roll for each attack that hit its target.
## [[Keys]]
#### Hell-Scouring Swiftness (Melee 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal can make up to (highest of Dexterity, Stamina, or Wits) attacks, and removes the limit on how many range bands she can move. She applies the rush roll against all enemies she hit from close range, though she can still only move to pursue a rushed enemy once.
