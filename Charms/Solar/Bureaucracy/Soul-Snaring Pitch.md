*The Solar can sell sand to a Delzahn.*
This Charm is a persuade action to convince a character that a particular thing is his heart’s desire. The Solar can sell literally anything EX3 287 at outrageous prices. If the character’s permanent [[Willpower]] is equal to or lower than the Exalt’s [[Essence]], no roll is required. The Exalt can cause the target to sell himself into slavery for a handful of potsherds or a kiss. If the target’s [[Willpower]] is greater than the Lawgiver’s [[Essence]], the Solar rolls a ([[Manipulation]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) persuade action with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes against the target’s [[Resolve]]. If successful, the target is not only convinced that he must attain whatever the Solar is selling, but its value in his eyes is multiplied by the number of extra successes on the roll. In order to resist this effect, a character must spend (the Solar’s [[Essence]]) in [[Willpower]]. Resisting [[Soul-Snaring Pitch]] makes a character immune to the Charm for one week.
