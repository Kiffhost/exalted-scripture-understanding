*The Dragon-Blood harmonizes her body with one of the five elements, rendering her body almost impervious to any harm from that element.*
She chooses one of the five elements upon activating this Charm, gaining +3 natural soak and ([[Stamina]]) [[Hardness]] against attacks made using that element, such as a firewand’s blast, a wooden spear, a hurled stone, or the talons of an air elemental. She subtracts (lower of [[Stamina]] or [[Resistance]]) from the damage of appropriate [[environmental hazards]]. This Charm can only negate harm that directly relates to the chosen element. An Earth-aspected use won’t defend against metal weapons, nor would a Fireaspected use defend against a [[Blazing Solar Bolt]].
