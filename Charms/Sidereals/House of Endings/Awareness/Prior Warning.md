The Sidereal’s senses extend into her immediate future, probing for anything that could cause her harm. The Sidereal can roll to detect an immediate threat in advance of when she would be able to detect it normally. This roll uses whatever dice pool and difficulty would be used to detect the threat; if that’s not clear, the Sidereal rolls (Perception + Awareness) against difficulty 1-5. Success doesn’t reveal the threat but gives the Sidereal a feeling of unease that lets her know there is some form of impending danger. This foreboding adds (Essence) dice on her roll to actually detect the threat. This Charm’s premonitions typically occur a few minutes in advance, but if this isn’t feasible, the Storyteller should ensure the warning comes in time to be potentially useful to the Sidereal. She can’t sense dangers that only threaten her in the long run, like a slow-acting poison or a courtier planning to frame her.
