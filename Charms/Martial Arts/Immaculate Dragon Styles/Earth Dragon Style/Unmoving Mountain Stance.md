Motionless as a statue, the Immaculate stubbornly refuses to yield ground to her enemies. After being hit by an attack, but before damage is rolled, she may use this Charm.TheInitiativeherattackerwouldgainfromwitheringdamage is reduced by (her Stamina/2, rounded up), although this doesn’t negate the Initiative he gains for hitting her or the Initiative Break for crashing her. Smash attacks (Exalted, p. 586) or other attacks that forcibly move the Immaculate fail to do so unless they deal at least (Stamina + Resistance) withering damage or (Stamina) decisive damage. In Earth Aura, the Immaculate denies her attacker (Stamina) Initiative, and adds (Essence) to the minimum damage that must be dealt to knock her back.
