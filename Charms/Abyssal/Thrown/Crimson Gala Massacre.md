*Like a heron spreading its wings wide, the Abyssal unleashes a fan of blades, painting galas crimson with atrocity while she remains serene at the center.*
The Abyssal adds a free full Excellency when she Joins Battle against at least one nontrivial enemy whom she has interacted with socially within the last day. Before any character takes a turn, she may make a decisive attack against each enemy who satisfies one of the following conditions:
 - She’s succeeded on an inspire, instill, persuade, or read intentions roll against him in the current scene, or previously during an ongoing social event.
 - He’s failed on a roll against her [[Resolve]] or [[Guile]] in the current scene, or previously during an ongoing social event.
 - He has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward the Abyssal.
 - He’s a trivial enemy.
The Abyssal doesn’t need to aim to attack enemies at medium range or beyond. Against enemies with [[Initiative]] lower than the Abyssal’s and trivial enemies, these attacks are ambushes (Exalted, p. 203).
Otherwise, they’re surprise attacks.
The deathknight divides her [[Initiative]] evenly, rounded up, among all hit opponents to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring [[Hardness]]. Trivial opponents suffer her full [[Initiative]] in damage, and aren’t included in the division. Once the attacks are completed, as long as any of them hit a nontrivial opponent, the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]] resets.
Enemies who witness the attacks must roll ([[Wits]] + [[Awareness]]) at a difficulty of (Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + base [[Guile]]), similar to [[Knives Between Friends]]. Ambushed enemies automatically fail without receiving a roll. This is capable of triggerering [[Pitiless Scything Razor]], but only against an enemy the Abyssal already ambushed in the initial barrage.
If the Abyssal has any attacks banked with [[Courtier’s Murderous Contemplation]], she can unleash them as part of this onslaught, ignoring that Charm’s once-per-round limit and applying the above benefits to each attack she makes.
This Charm is incompatible with [[Charms]] from other combat Abilities that enhance [[Join Battle]].
