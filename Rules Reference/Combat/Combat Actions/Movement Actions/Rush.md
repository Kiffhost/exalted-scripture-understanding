This action may only be directed at an opponent within short range of the character, and *it may explicitly be used even after taking a reflexive [[#Move]] action*. 

A rush action is a contested (Dexterity + Athletics) roll between the character and an opponent at short range. If the rushing character is successful, then as soon as his opponent moves a range band, he will immediately and reflexively move one range band toward that opponent, keeping pace. This reflexive movement does not count as a movement action, and so it can occur outside the character’s turn, regardless of whether he has already taken a movement action that round.

Characters must have some means of reaching an opponent in order to rush him—if the opponent is a winged Lunar Exalt who travels a range band upward into the sky, most characters would not be able to follow him.
