Shifting between skins with effortless grace, the Lunar attains the pinnacle of formless perfection.
The Skin’s wearer gains the following benefits while using Constant Quicksilver Transformation:
 - In animal shapes, the armor’s [[Hardness]] increases by ([[Essence]]).
 - Mercurial Predator Transformation’s bonus increases to +3.
 - The Protean discount from [[Shifter’s Claw Strike]] can be applied to [[Initiative]] costs as well as mote costs. If this reduces a Charm’s [[Initiative]] cost to zero, it loses the Perilous keyword, letting the Lunar use it while crashed.
 - If the Lunar renews [[Constant Quicksilver Rearrangement]] at the end of its duration, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost.
