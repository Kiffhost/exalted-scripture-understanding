*Across scorching sands and numbing tundra, the Abyssal traveler walks without fear.*
The Abyssal ignores environmental penalties on [[Survival]] rolls, and doubles 9s on rolls to resist mundane environmental hazards. She also gains this benefit against supernatural hazards that are similar to perils found in nature, like a wall of sorcerous flame.
With a [[Survival]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal also subtracts ([[Stamina]]) dice from the damage of such environmental hazards. She can breathe in any environment, including underwater.
