*The Lunar walks pathways unseen by mortal eyes.*
As long as no one outside her traveling party is [[tracking]] them or knows their current location or intended destination, Monarch-Wing Migration’s speed multiplier increases to ([[Essence]]). This increased speed takes the form of impossible shortcuts that slash hours or even days off travel times, rather than a constant speed enhancement; thus, characters can’t realize they’re being tracked by noticing this benefit ends. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is migratory can learn this as a [[Perception]] Charm.
