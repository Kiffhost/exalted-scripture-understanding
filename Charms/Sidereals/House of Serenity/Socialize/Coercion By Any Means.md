Passing a hand over her eyes, the Sidereal blinds herself to the subtle distinctions society draws between different applications of uneven force. When the Sidereal makes a grapple gambit, her target’s Defense is penalized by positive Ties toward her or Intimacies that reflect a feeling of dominance over her or desire to exploit her. He also suffers a −(Intimacy) penalty on his roll opposing her control roll. Such Intimacies count as supporting any influence rolls the Sidereal makes against him for the clinch’s duration. She can flurry such rolls with grapple actions. Reset: Once per scene unless reset by crashing an enemy with a withering savaging attack or losing a roll opposing an enemy’s grapple control roll.
