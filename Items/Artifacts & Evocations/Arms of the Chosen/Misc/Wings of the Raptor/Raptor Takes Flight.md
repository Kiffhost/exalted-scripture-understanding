*The cloak unfurls into feathered wings with a 20-foot span.*
As long as the wearer has sufficient clearance, she can fly as though she had the five-dot version of the [[Wings]] Merit (Exalted, p. 167). For each of the following [[Charms]] the Exalt knows, reduce the cost of [[Raptor Takes Flight]] by two motes: [[Soaring Crane Leap]], [[Unbound Eagle Approach]], EagleWing Style. A Lunar with a flying form reduces the cost by five motes. Treat [[Raptor Takes Flight]] as [[Eagle-Wing Style]] for purposes of activating [[Bonfire Anima Wings]]. 

## Dissonant

The wings’ precision and maneuverability are equivalent to the Merit’s three-dot version.
