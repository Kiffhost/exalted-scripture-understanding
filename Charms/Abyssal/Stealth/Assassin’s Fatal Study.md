*So thorough is the Abyssal’s study of her victim that she knows his every blind spot, leaving him little hope of seeing her final strike.*
To use this Charm, the Abyssal must be in combat against a nontrivial enemy she’s used [[Silence Costs Dearly]] to bank successes against. She reflexively rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) to enter concealment, expending all banked successes and adding them to the roll as a non-Charm bonus. Enemies other than her target add +3 non-Charm dice on their rolls against this.
