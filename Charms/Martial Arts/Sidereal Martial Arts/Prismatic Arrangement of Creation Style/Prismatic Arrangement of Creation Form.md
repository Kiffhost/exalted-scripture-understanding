*The martial artist vanishes into the world’s [[Essence]], dancing the dance of all things before returning to the world, at one with it.*
The stylist gains either the benefits of all this style’s other Forms or up to three [[Martial Arts]] Forms she knows of any style. If she chooses the latter option, only one Form can be from a Sidereal Martial Art. Combining Forms of different styles lets her use each style’s weapons and the best of their armor compatibility with each of the other styles. If the stylist satisfies the special activation rules of a Form she knows, she may swap it for one of the chosen Forms, as long as it’s still a permissible combination.
## Enlightenment
Upon entering this Form, the stylist gains one [[Initiative]] for each style she’s learned all [[Charms]] for (including this one), maximum ([[Essence]] + [Lore or Occult]). Sidereals count [[Archery]], [[Brawl]], [[Melee]], and [[Thrown]] as completed styles if they’ve learned their prayer strip Charm. [[Sorcery]] Sidereals pursue countless paths of sorcerous initiation, whether learned in their mortal lives or guided through them by their mentors, both Sidereals and gods alike. Such mentorships are often the foundation of deep bonds that endure for centuries.
