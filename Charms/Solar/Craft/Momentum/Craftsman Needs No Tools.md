A Solar who has mastered this Charm can work directly with her chosen material, shaping it with hands, breath, and voice. Without the need for tools or a workshop, the Exalt can start basic and major projects as soon as she has the proper ingredients, and can complete such works with blazing speed, often in just minutes or seconds. Using [[Craftsman Needs No Tools]] does allow for the Solar to gain craft point bonuses from her handiwork, and can be used equally well in both building and repair projects. Additionally, if the Solar uses tools to assist her work, the cost of the Charm is reduced by two motes. This Charm does not meaningfully speed the completion of superior or legendary projects.
