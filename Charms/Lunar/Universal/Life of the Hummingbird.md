Sipping blood from a fresh kill, the Lunar briefly borrows its skin. After killing a human or animal, she temporarily takes on its shape as though she had its heartâ€™s blood. This Charm ends if she leaves that shape. With an Essence 2 repurchase, she can use this Charm after drinking fresh blood from a live human or animal (potentially after wounding it with a decisive attack).
