The Sidereal’s anima hisses as poison flows through her veins, the sound of her problems becoming everyone’s problems. The Sidereal adds (Presence) dice on a roll against poison. The total intervals of poison negated by the roll are stored as a memorandum appended to her fate, maximum (Stamina). The Sidereal can also use this Charm to discharge a memorandum with a decisive attack, even if the stored poison can’t normally be conveyed through attacks. Her enemy must roll against the stored intervals of poison if it hits.
