The Exalt becomes a shadow, vanishing from the mind after but an instant out of sight. The cost of the following Charms is reduced by two motes: Easily-Overlooked Presence Method, Mental Invisibility Technique, and Vanishing from Mind’s Eye Method (Exalted, pp. 403407). In addition, the presence of the Forgotten Blade doesn’t count as being obtrusive for purposes of EasilyOverlooked Presence Method.
