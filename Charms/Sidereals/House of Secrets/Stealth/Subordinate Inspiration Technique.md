*Whispering from the shadows, the Sidereal bends those around her to her will.*
While in concealment, the Sidereal can make Manipulation-based influence rolls against a single target without needing to speak. Her target hears her words as if they were his own thoughts, suffering −2 Resolve. If the Sidereal’s roll fails, he rolls (Perception + Integrity) opposing it. Success reveals that someone’s attempting to tamper with his thoughts, but not who.
The Sidereal is never perceived as the source of this influence.
