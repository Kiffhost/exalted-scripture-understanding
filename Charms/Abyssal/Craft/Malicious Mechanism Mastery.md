*The deathknight greets her enemies with an unseen arsenal, laying traps of exquisite cruelty in anticipation of her foes’ folly.*
The Abyssal reveals that an enemy within medium range has stumbled into one of her traps, a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty (relevant Craft).
If the Abyssal uses this Charm against an enemy within short range of a corpse, she adds +2 to the hazard’s difficulty.
Damaging traps have Damage (Essence)L, plus an additional die for each success the target failed by.
Snares, pit traps, and the like instead inflicts the effects of being grappled on an enemy who fails his roll, with one round of control plus an additional round for each success he failed by. The Abyssal can’t take the usual special grapple actions but doesn’t suffer any penalties.
A trapped character or his ally can spend their entire turn to reduce the clinch’s rounds of control by two.
Attacking or damaging the Abyssal doesn’t subtract rounds of control.
If the Abyssal has a relevant Craft, she gains three silver points if her target fails his roll. If a damaging trap incapacitates a nontrivial enemy or a snared nontrivial enemy surrenders or is incapacitated, she gains additional gold points equal to his Essence.
