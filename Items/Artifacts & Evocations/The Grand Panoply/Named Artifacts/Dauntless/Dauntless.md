*When Zan the Invincible, Sword of Heaven, stood alone against an army of thirty men, his Circlemates worried.*
When he stood alone against an army of sixty men, they asked him to wait for them next time. Finally, when he stood alone against an army of one hundred men, they knew they must act. While the Dawn’s back was turned, Arem Bear-Arms, the silent Nightbringer, collected strands of hair from every soldier in the single-handedly crushed battalion in the blink of an eye. He gave them to Zhui the Traveler, the industrious Copper Spider, who used them to fashion arcane fibers that would lash together orichalcum plates in a suit of shining [[Lamellar|lamellar armor]], enchanted with a blessing from the spirit of zeal for the challenge of battle. To this, Zhui added great domed pauldrons etched with Old Realm runes depicting tales of grand triumph, and a [[Hauberk]] of orichalcum to wear beneath the plates. From then on, Zan’s Circlemates were assured that though he would continue to leap headfirst into overwhelming odds, he would have their aid even in their absence. An Exalt who revels in the thrill of combat and possesses unparalleled valor finds that this armor amplifies her natural ability to throw herself wholly into strife and emerge victorious. [[Dauntless]] possesses two hearthstone sockets, one on each shoulder. 

## [[Evocations]] of [[Dauntless]]

By paying four extra motes at attunement, [[Dauntless]] grants the Solar great strength and ferocity, adding one non-Charm automatic success to any attempt to lift or break an object and treating his [[Strength]] as if it were three higher for all such attempts. It also loves to absorb punishment: any decisive damage roll that has at least a single 1 in the result is reduced by a single success; while in [[Full Defense]], the armor absorbs all the 1s and 2s of attack rolls made by battle groups, adding them to the Solar’s [[Initiative]]. The Exalt may gain no more than five [[Initiative]] per round in this fashion.
