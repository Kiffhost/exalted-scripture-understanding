Swift to win new friends and impress new acquaintances, the Dragon-Blood reads them and tailors her bearing to their expectations to leave a perfect first impression. Upon meeting a character for the first time, the Dragon-Blood may combine a read intentions action with an instill action to create a positive Tie towards herself, making a single ([Charisma, [[Appearance]], or Perception] + [[Socialize]]) roll against his (lower of [[Guile]] or [[Resolve]]).
