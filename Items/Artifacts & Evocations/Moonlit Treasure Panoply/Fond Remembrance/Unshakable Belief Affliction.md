The difference between belief and illusion means little before Fond Remembrance’s edge.
## Resonant
Only characters who are resonant with [[Fond Remembrance]] can awaken this Evocation.
The wielder can use this Evocation when she strengthens one of a character’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] related to a false memory to Defining intensity. Until that false memory’s Psyche effect is broken, that [[Intimacy]] can’t be weakened or altered.
If the wielder raised the [[Intimacy]] to Defining with [[Heartfelt Memory Feint]], this Evocation costs only five motes, one [[Willpower]].

## Reset 
This Evocation can only be used against a character once per story.
