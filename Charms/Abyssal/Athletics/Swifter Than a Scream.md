*The thrill of murder urges the Abyssal onward to her next victim with incredible speed.*
After incapacitating a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack, the deathknight can move one range band toward another nontrivial enemy. If she enters close range with him, she may reflexively make a decisive attack against him with (Dexterity + Athletics) dice of damage. This follow-up attack doesn’t reset her Initiative.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm multiple times in a single tick, she waives the Willpower cost of activations past the first.
