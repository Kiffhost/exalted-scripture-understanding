Weathered by her time at sea, the Dragon-Blood is undaunted by unknown terrors and deaf to the calls of sirens. She gains +1 Resolve against fear-based influence, as well as any influence that would cause her to sail her ship into peril or prevent her from taking to the seas aboard her ship. If she incorporates the memory of a past seafaring adventure into a stunt, this bonus increases to (Sail/2, rounded up) for that action.
