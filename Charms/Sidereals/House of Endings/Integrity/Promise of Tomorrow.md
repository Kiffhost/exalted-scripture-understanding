*The Sidereal may have no hopes, but Creation’s hopes for her sustain her.*
When the Sidereal discerns an auspicious prospect, she forms a Defining Principle representing her hope that she’ll fulfill it. This Intimacy can’t be weakened by any means except the Sidereal’s own Integrity Charms.
Upon fulfilling the auspicious prospect, the Sidereal loses this Principle and rolls (Intimacy) dice. For each success, she may gain one Willpower or lose one Limit.
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset by fulfilling the chosen prospect.
