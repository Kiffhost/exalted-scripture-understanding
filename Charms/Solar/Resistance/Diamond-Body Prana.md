*The Exalt inverts her anima, turning the substance of her existence into something far beyond normal harm.*
For the rest of the scene, basic scenery damage, such as crashing through a window, running through a bramble, or stepping through a burning corridor (flames of less intensity than 4L per turn) does her no harm. The Solar can’t be hurt by light contact with normally damaging edges. Her skin is tough enough for the claws of a tiger to skid off harmlessly, so long as the tiger isn’t actually striking her. 

This Charm provides the following protection against withering attacks: when activated, the Solar rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) dice with ([[Essence]] or three, whichever is higher) automatic successes and adds the successes to her soak for the rest of the scene. This roll cannot be enhanced by other magic. 

Against decisive attacks, this Charm provides ([[Stamina]]) hardness, and can stack with [[Durability of Oak Meditation]], reducing that Charm’s hardness bonus to +2. [[Diamond-Body Prana]] is incompatible with armor.
