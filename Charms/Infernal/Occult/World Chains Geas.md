*The gods once bowed before the infinite betters without bidding, but in this fallen Age, the Infernal must remind them of their proper place.*

The Infernal rolls ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Occult) against the Resolve of a dematerialized character she can perceive, forcing him to materialize if he succeeds. (He doesn’t pay the cost for materializing). He can’t dematerialize for the rest of the scene.

Demons suffer −1 Resolve against this, or −2 if their Essence is less than or equal to the Infernal’s. If the Infernal has [[Wayward Divinity Oversight]], the penalty applies to any entity that’s compatible with it.

With Essence 3, the Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm against multiple targets.
