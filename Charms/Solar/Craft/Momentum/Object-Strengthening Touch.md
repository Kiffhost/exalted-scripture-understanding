*With a bare touch, the Solar can infuse an object of ([[Essence]] + 2) yards in radius with hardening [[Essence]], greatly increasing its durability.*
Using this Charm increases the difficulty to destroy the object by the (Solarâ€™s [[Essence]] + 1). If the Solar is holding the object, it becomes nighunbreakable without magic. Objects strengthened with this Charm also become resistant to fire, acid, freezing, and other forms of damage. The benefits of this Charm last only one scene, but they stack with the effects of the prerequisite for that scene. Use of this Charm does not accrue craft points.
