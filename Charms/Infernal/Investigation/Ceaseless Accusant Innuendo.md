*The Infernal confronts the wicked with their sins in a sick mockery of justice.*

If the Infernal reveals her knowledge of a character’s misdeeds or evidence that could implicate him as part of a bargain or threaten roll, she doubles 8s on the roll. If this leverages an Intimacy based on guilt or a Tie of fear to her, the Resolve penalty is increased by one. The influence costs an additional Willpower to resist, or two Willpower if they target has an applicable Defining Intimacy.

If the Infernal’s roll fails by two or fewer successes, her target is left wary and nervous, instilling an Intimacy based on guilt or a Tie of fear to the Infernal, chosen by the target’s player.

If the Infernal uses this Charm together with [[Exquisite Trespass Connoisseur]] after she’s uncovered a secret with that Charm, the secret penalizes her target’s Resolve as if it were an Intimacy, including the increased penalty from this Charm.
