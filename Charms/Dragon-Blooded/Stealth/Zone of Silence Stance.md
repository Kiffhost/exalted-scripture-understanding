The Dragon-Blood weighs down the air around her, trappingsoundsinfrozenstillness.Shecansilencetheringingof blades, the desperate cry of a wounded bandit, or the shatteringofathousand-year-oldvase.ThisCharmfunctionsas Soundless Action Prana, but silences the Exalt completely, defeating even supernatural hearing. In addition, she can radiate silence out to close range, making it impossible to hear anyone or anything within that radius and obstructing the passage of sound through the zone of silence as though it were a solid steel dome over her. Characters may pay one Willpower to speak forcefully enough to pierce the silence long enough to make one social roll if remaining silent would threaten one of their Major or Defining Intimacies. In Air Aura, the Dragon-Blood may expand the zone of silence by one range band at the end of each round, maximum long range.
