The Lunar dramatically magnifies her body’s density, withstanding the mightiest blows without yielding an inch. For an instant, she can’t be physically moved, whether by smash attacks, a grappler’s throw, [[Heaven Thunder Hammer]] (Exalted, p. 274), etc. This Charm can’t prevent falls due to gravity. It can be used after an attack roll, but before damage. If an enemy uses applicable magic after damage is rolled, this Charm may be used at that time. This Charm significantly increases the Lunar’s mass. This normally causes no complications, but may cause the Lunar to sink into soft mud, snap a tightrope supporting her, etc. It also suppresses Graceful Crane Stance’s effect for an instant. L U N A R S : FA N G S AT T H E G AT E
