*The Infernal remakes this sad and broken world into a paradise that most can only wish for.*

The Infernal grants a wish on a grand scale, affecting large groups of people — potentially even a kingdom. She may do so when she hears someone who holds a position of power within the group express dissatisfaction or dislike for some aspect of its current state, including voicing her own dissatisfaction with a group she holds authority over. The wish’s scope can’t exceed the authority held by the character whose wish she grants. If she wishes to affect an entire a kingdom, only its ruler will do.

The scope of this miracle also depends on the Infernal’s Cult rating:
- **Cult 1**: A town, a group of small villages, a district of a small city.
- **Cult 2**: A small city, a district of a larger city, a group of towns or villages.
- **Cult 3**: A large city or multiple smaller ones.
- **Cult 4**: A kingdom, a huge metropolis, multiple large cities.
- **Cult 5**: All but the largest of kingdoms. At this point, the authority of the character making the wish is the primary limit, rather than size.

The wish’s effect is akin to using [[Verdant Emptiness Endowment]] or its keys on any number of group members, but on a broad, narrative level.
### Increasing Traits
The Infernal grants benefits that are narratively analogous to increasing a character’s Abilities or Attributes. She might turn a general’s ragtag forces into elite soldiers, or transform a city’s entire population into renowned beauties. These effects can also extend to the region itself. If an Infernal turns a kingdom’s dullards into learned savants after hearing its prince bemoan their ignorance, libraries and centres of learning might also spring into existence across the kingdom.
### Bestowal of Accursed Fortune
The Infernal alters social and economic fortunes, a narrative equivalent to granting all characters a dot in a Merit. She might bestow enough wealth to raise an entire kingdom’s standard of living, turn a city into a major hub of Guild commerce, or secure a powerful ally to support its interests.
### Scoured Perfection of Form
The Infernal grants five dots of mutations to any number of affected characters or bestow similar transformations.
### Miracle Gift Mastery
The Infernal alters the nature of supernatural beings that belong to the group. This is comparable to what a Celestial Circle working could achieve, but it’s typically slightly less powerful than a sorcerous working (Exalted, p. 485). This can’t affect the Exalted or beings with Essence 6+.

Granting the wish indebts the supplicant to the Infernal. This works like [[Verdant Emptiness Endowment]], except that she can demand a serious task (Exalted, p. 216) of him. The consequences of refusal take the form of a disaster or misfortune that befalls the entire group, creating significant setbacks for the supplicant.
## Reset
Once per story. If the scope of the wish was at least two lower than the maximum the Infernal’s Cult rating allows, this is reduced to once per session.
