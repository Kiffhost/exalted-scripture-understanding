With a whirling slash, the walls of the world fall away, leaving Moonreaver’s master and her foe in the strange sands of Bright Withering’s durance.
The wielder can use this Evocation after crashing an enemy affected by [[Cold Breath of the Moon]]. Add Cold Breath of the Moon’s penalty to the [[Initiative]] awarded by the attack. As she strikes, the scythe cuts open a rift to the othermoon, drawing in both the wielder and the crashed enemy, along with any trivial enemies within short range the wielder wishes to bring along. They appear in the otherworld’s pale sands, the same distance from each other as they originally were.
The combatants arrive in a wide-open stretch of the moonscape’s terrain, letting them move freely across it.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, it may include difficult terrain — craters, rock formations, etc. — or other natural features. Exposure to its freezing cold is an environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round.
Those damaged by it are penalized as per [[Cold Breath of the Moon]]. The wielder isn’t immune to this. The Storyteller shouldn’t roll for trivial characters; they’re incapacitated automatically by the hazard.
The wielder and her foe remain on the othermoon until this Evocation’s duration ends, at which point the rift reopens, returning them to where they were. It’s up to the wielder whether trivial foes return. The wielder can’t end this Evocation prematurely unless her enemy is incapacitated, or if neither wishes to continue fighting. Her enemy can likewise end it by incapacitating her. He can also escape by withdrawing from combat (Exalted, p. 199) to escape through a lingering echo of the rift he was caught in.
Others can’t perceive or interact with those banished to the othermoon, or vice versa. However, magic like [[Silver Curtain Parted]] (Lunars, p. 249) can be used to follow the wielder through the rift. Note that the othermoon isn’t normally accessible by such magic; the rift cut open by this Evocation is necessary to make it possible.
Moonlit Horizon Reaper’s environmental hazard doesn’t stack with the othermoon’s. Instead, while using that Evocation, the othermoon’s hazard gains +1 difficulty and Damage and the wielder becomes immune to it.
## Resonant
With an [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, the wielder can also bring allies within short range of her to the othermoon along with her, paying a surcharge of five [[Initiative]] per ally and one [[Willpower]] to do so.
## Dissonant
This Evocation is Supplemental and must be declared before the attack roll.
