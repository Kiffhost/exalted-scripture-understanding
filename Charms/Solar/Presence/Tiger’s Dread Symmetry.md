*The Lawgiver is a singular and terrifying being, awesome to behold.*
Learning this Charm grants one bonus die to all [[Presence]] rolls and allows the Exalt to reroll ([[Essence]] or three, whichever is greater) non-successes on rolls to intimidate. In addition, if the Solar has activated Majestic Radiant [[Presence]], a character must resist an automatic intimidate attempt before he’s able to attempt an ambush attack. This effect does not make the Solar aware of her attacker—it simply means that, as her assassin draws a bead on her from the shadows, her fierce look and deadly grace emanates forth to cow him. The intimidate action may only be supported by [[Charms]] that are ongoing or otherwise can be used unconsciously.
