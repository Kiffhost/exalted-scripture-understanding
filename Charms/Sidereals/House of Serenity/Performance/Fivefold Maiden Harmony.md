The Sidereal plays the music of the spheres, the songs once sung by the Five Maidens. The Sidereal plays her patron Maiden’s song, granting its benefits to all allies who her it. She can’t take non-reflexive actions during this performance. Mercury: Dancing Maiden Tarantella. Allies gain −1 target number on movement rolls and dance-based Performance rolls. They may use Performance instead of the normal Abilities for movement actions. Venus: Spirit-Soothing Melody. Allies gain +2 Resolve, which is non-Charm against Psyche and Shaping effects. They also increase the Resolve bonus from positive Ties and Principles of compassion by one. They’re immune to influence rolls to inspire negative emotions. Mars: Battle Anthem of the Sidereal Exalted. Allies’ damage roll convert one die to an automatic success. Against enemies of fate, this increases to (Sidereal’s Essence, maximum 5) dice. Battle groups gain −1 target number on rout checks. Jupiter: Silence Within Song. Allies gain −1 target number on Manipulation and Larceny rolls. Trivial characters automatically fail Perception rolls against them. Saturn: Requiem for the Foretold Dead. Allies’ attacks ignore (higher of Sidereal’s Essence or 3) soak and Hardness. Enemies killed by them pass into Lethe, never lingering as ghosts. The Sidereal can repurchase this Charm to learn other Maidens’ songs; she can only play one at a time.
