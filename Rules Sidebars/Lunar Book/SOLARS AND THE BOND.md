Most Solars that encounter their Lunar mates experience a similar recognition and emotional connection, using the same rules as Lunars. That not all Solars do is a testament to the Lunar’s greater capacity to change their nature. The same is true for Abyssals and Infernals, although they have a tendency toward negative Ties on first meeting their mates. A player may always opt not to reciprocate the bond if her Lunar mate is a Storyteller character. If she’s a player character, the two players should discuss whether they’re interested in a narrative of unreciprocated feelings beforehand.
