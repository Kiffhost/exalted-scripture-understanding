The Sidereal casts a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden into the air, where it burns like a hot coal, casting a flickering red light as an unnatural night falls around her. The Sidereal rolls (Strength + Presence) opposing the (Strength + Integrity) rolls against all enemies within long range, even those she’s unaware of. Those who fail are bound to the Sidereal, suffering +1 target number on rolls opposing her. When she takes damage, she may pay five motes, one Willpower to inflict the same amount of damage on one or more affected enemies, dividing that damage evenly among them, rounded up. Withering damage inflicted this way doesn’t award Initiative.
