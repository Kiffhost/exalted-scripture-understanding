*Wings-of-Steel Bulwark Countless phantasmal copies of the stylist’s signature weapons fill the air around her as her [[Essence]] becomes one with that of her chosen weapon.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have Arsenal 1+.
She gains the following benefits: 
- +1 Arsenal, which can raise it to 6.
- Her withering attacks add +(Arsenal) Overwhelming.
- She doubles up to (Arsenal) 10s on decisive damage rolls.
- She can combine [[Evocations]] from multiple signature weapons on a single attack or defense.
## Special activation rules
Upon dealing (5 – Arsenal, minimum 1) levels of damage to a nontrivial enemy with a decisive attack, the stylist may reflexively enter this Form. Damage dealt by [[Sword-Shrike’s Garden]] can also trigger this.
