Ecstatic in battle, the Sidereal welcomes the blows of her enemies and denies them their power thereby. The Sidereal can use this Charm after being hit by an attack but before the damage roll, inflicting +1 target number. This costs two motes against withering damage and four motes against decisive damage. With a [[Presence]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, if the Siderealâ€™s unarmored, she may pay a oneWillpower surcharge to inflict +2 target number.
