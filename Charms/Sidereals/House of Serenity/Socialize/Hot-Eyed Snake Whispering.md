The Sidereal exudes mysterious desirability, drawing eyes and snaring hearts with a deft hand on the strands of fate. When the Sidereal makes a persuade or bargain roll with any Ability, she can treat any positive Tie her target has toward her as a Tie of romantic or sexual desire. If a character is of incompatible sexual orientation with the Sidereal, she instead treats his Tie as one of fascination.
