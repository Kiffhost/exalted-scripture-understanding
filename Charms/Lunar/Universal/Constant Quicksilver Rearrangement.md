Unbound by form’s constraints, the Lunar unleashes a menagerie against her foes. She waives the cost of changing shapes and lowers Quicksilver Second Face’s cost to one Initiative. This applies only to basic shapeshifting actions, not Charms like Towering Beast Form or Emerald Grasshopper Form. An Essence 4 repurchase extends this Charm’s duration to one day.
