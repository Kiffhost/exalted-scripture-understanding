*Void Demiurge’s Art (x2) Striving beyond the ambition of mortal smiths, the Abyssal unleashes her unfettered genius.*
When the Abyssal rolls for a [[Craft]] project, every three successes she receives lets her roll an additional non-Charm die. Successes from these dice are counted in determining how many total dice she can roll with this Charm — e.g., if she rolled three successes with the extra dice, she’d then roll another die.
With an [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, when the Abyssal rolls enough successes with this Charm’s extra dice to let her roll additional dice, she rolls an additional three non-Charm dice. This benefit can only trigger once, even if she rolls 3+ successes on the new dice.
