The sorcerer speaks words that bind the tongue—she evokes a seething, bilious mass of green Essence between her hands and casts it down the throat of a victim at short range, where it dissolves into a ward that censors that character’s mind. As she does, she forbids the victim from speaking of a single subject, which may be as specific as “The letters I secretly send to the All-Seeing Eye at the end of every month” or as broad as “The existence of Sidereal Exalted.” It is impossible to defend against this curse barring magic that can perfectly dodge or parry uncountable damage such as Heavenly Guardian Defense, but the sorcerer must roll (Intelligence + Occult) against the victim’s Resolve to successfully bind his will. A cursed character feels waves of nausea if he even thinks of trying to communicate anything about the topic. If he tries to do so despite this warning, he becomes overwhelmed with wracking pain and begins vomiting up dozens of fat, white maggots, rendering that action or any other impossible for at least a turn. This applies to all forms of communication—speaking, writing, telepathy, or any desperate signals the victim tries to use to circumvent the restriction of this curse—and persists until the cursed character ceases trying to violate the ban. This spell may be ended by the sorcerer’s death or may be willingly released, as the sorcerer reaches a hand down the victim’s mouth and recites the last word of this spell backwards to extract a slimy egg-sac full of squirming larvae that is the physical embodiment of this curse. 

A sorcerer who knows Corrupted Words as her control spell may cast it with no obvious display of magical intervention other than a faint flash of green in her eyes, leaving her victim uncertain as to the affliction’s source. 

# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15):
Distorting this curse makes it possible for the victim to speak around the forbidden subject matter for five minutes. He must speak using circumlocutions, flowery metaphors, or cryptic symbolism to communicate the broad gist of the topic, and cannot go into any level of detail beyond the most superficial. This does not avert the inevitable tide of maggots, but gives the victim enough time to speak before he must disgorge them.
