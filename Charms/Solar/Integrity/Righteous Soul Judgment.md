When the Solar experiences a profound challenge to her beliefs, such as being forced to act against a Defining Principle, or having her beliefs stripped down and mocked by her enemies, the spirit of the Unconquered Sun descends upon her, and she may ignore the cost of any three Charms to resist torment, social influence, damage, or illness. She may also use this Charm to complete a feat of strength which would aid her in an act of defiance or righteous judgment against her enemies. This Charm can be used once per day, but may be reset by upholding a Defining Principle even when the consequences will be severe to those the Lawgiver loves.
