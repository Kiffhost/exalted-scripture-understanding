*If a Green Sun Prince falters in her courtly manners, what of it? Etiquette is law, and law is dictated by the powerful.*

As long as the Infernal makes at least a token effort to follow cultural customs, etiquette, and the like, any faux pas or breaches she commits will be easily forgiven, accepted as the natural right of the powerful. Characters won’t weaken positive Ties toward her or form negative Ties toward her as a result of small, good-faith lapses. This also negates penalties on influence rolls due to her lack of familiarity with the culture or society she’s dealing with.

The Infernal is especially captivating for characters who have an Intimacy related to the customs, etiquette, or cultural practices in question. Such characters count as having a Minor Tie of fascination toward her, and are particularly forgiving of her missteps. Conversely, characters with negative Ties toward foreigners and outsiders treat their intensity as one step weaker against her.
## [[Keys]]
#### Brazen Diplomatic Indulgence
The Infernal can pass off even the most blatantly deliberate of faux pas and violations of custom, explaining things away with the flimsiest of pretenses. She makes a special (Manipulation + Socialize) instill roll with (higher of Essence or 3) automatic successes, causing affected characters to overlook the faux pas as with this Charm’s usual effect. However, doing so ends this Charm. Characters who were directly harmed or inconvenienced by the Infernal’s act can pay one Willpower to resist this influence.
#### Eloquent Blasphemy Repartee (Socialize 5, Essence 2, [[#Brazen Diplomatic Indulgence]])
When the Infernal makes an instill, persuade, or bargain roll, she can use [[#Brazen Diplomatic Indulgence]] and end this Charm to ensure that no one who hears her takes offense, as per this Charm’s usual effect. No separate influence roll is needed — the effect applies automatically, even if her influence fails.
