The Solar is consumed by cold cruelty, no longer recognizing others as worthy of respect or life. He will harm others without a second thought if he benefits from doing so, and has no aversion whatsoever to the use of torture, terror, and mutilation. His manner is cruel and scathing, even to friends and allies, mocking and verbally tormenting them as a matter of course.
[[Deliberate Cruelty]] can be ended prematurely if the Solarâ€™s actions cause harm to someone he has a Major or Defining positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards.
