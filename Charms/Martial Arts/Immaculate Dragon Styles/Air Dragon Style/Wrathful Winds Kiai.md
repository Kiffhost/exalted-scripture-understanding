*Echoing the awful roar with which Mela rules Creation’s storms, the Immaculate gives a ferocious shout that strikes like a gale-force blast.*
She rolls (Stamina + Martial Arts) as a special unblockable withering attack against all characters in a ninety-degree arc out to medium range, including allies. The attack doesn’t use a weapon; it has no Accuracy bonus, and has raw damage (Strength + Initiative + threshold successes) against each hit enemy, minimum (Strength). Damaged enemies are knocked back one range band and fall prone; enemies crashed by the attack can’t take a move action on their next turn. The Immaculate doesn’t gain any Initiative from this withering damage. Each 10 on a damage roll against an enemy rolls a die of decisive bashing damage against him, ignoring Hardness. 
Spirits instead suffer dice of decisive damage equal to the total withering damage dealt to them, and can be struck even if dematerialized. 
## Reset
This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial foe.
