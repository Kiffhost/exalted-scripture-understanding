*Dangling a stolen necklace or holding a knife to a hostage’s throat, the Abyssal drives a hard bargain with ill-gotten leverage.*
When the Abyssal uses something she’s stolen from a character as part of a bargain, persuade, or threaten roll against him, her influence costs an additional Willpower to resist. If her target has a Tie toward the object or other relevant Intimacy, the deathknight adds (Intimacy) non-Charm successes. This Charm isn’t limited to stolen objects — taking hostages or usurping a king’s throne also qualify.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used against a character once per session.
