*The armor’s ominous phenomena intensify to shelter its wearer from scrutiny — seething waters muffle her conversation, shadows enfold her to hide from prying eyes, leafy branches furl around her protectively.* 
This Evocation can be used when one or more characters make a [[Perception]] roll against the wearer or anything in arm’s reach of her, before they’ve rolled. For every 1, convert a die that came up successful to a failure, starting with 10s and working down. This Evocation’s benefits only apply when the environment allows for appropriate phenomena. 

## Resonant

This Evocation’s duration is Indefinite.
