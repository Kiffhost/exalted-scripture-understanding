*One day, all the cosmos will be silent. That day has yet to come.*

The Infernal chooses up to (Perception) of her negative Ties to individuals. She can pick Ties to mortals and First Circle demons without counting toward this limit. Whenever a hated character speaks about the Infernal within ({Essence + Intimacy} x 5) miles, she can pay three motes to listen in on him until he’s done speaking. Normally, no roll is required, but a (Perception + Awareness) roll at a difficulty set by the Storyteller may be necessary if her target has taken countermeasures to avoid supernatural eavesdropping.
