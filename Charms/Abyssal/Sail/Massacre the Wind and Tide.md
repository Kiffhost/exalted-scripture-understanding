*The deathknight rips at sea and sky alike, staining sails with blood and choking the water with gore.*
The Abyssal rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]) to curse a ship she can perceive, opposed by its captain’s ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]) roll. Success deprives it of wind and tides for (1 + extra successes) days:
 - Its [[Maneuverability]] is halved, rounded down. If it already has [[Maneuverability]] +0 or lower, it’s reduced by one instead.
 - Any Speed bonuses it receives from currents or winds are reduced by (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]), minimum +1.
 - If the ship’s Speed is reduced to +1 or lower, it’s assailed by the ghosts of the drowned. They stalk the decks by night at night, preventing those aboard the ship from recovering [[Willpower]] from sleep.
Spirits of air or water aboard the ship when the Abyssal curses it or within long range of it suffer (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) dice of aggravated damage, bleeding all-too-mortal blood as they’re torn apart by deathly [[Essence]]. If this kills them, they’re destroyed permanently.
The Abyssal can use this Charm in naval combat as a special stratagem that costs no Momentum. The opposing captain’s 1s subtract successes from his roll. If the Abyssal’s roll beats the enemy captain’s roll, she steals Momentum from its captain equal to the 1s on his roll, maximum (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]), in addition to cursing his ship.
