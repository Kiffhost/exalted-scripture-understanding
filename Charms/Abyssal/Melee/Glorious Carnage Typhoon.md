*Armies fall screaming before the Abyssal’s terrible might.*
The Abyssal makes a decisive attack against all enemies within close range, rolling (Initiative/2, rounded up) dice of decisive damage against each hit enemy. Against trivial enemies, she rolls her full [[Initiative]] and ignores [[Hardness]].
With [[Essence]] 5, this Charm’s cost is reduced by one mote.
With an [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, if the Abyssal incapacitates at least one enemy with this Charm, she may pay six motes, one anima, and two [[Initiative]] to reflexively make a withering attack against all enemies within close range. She gains full [[Initiative]] from the highest damage roll, but can’t gain more than three [[Initiative]] from other damage rolls (this doesn’t include [[Initiative]] Breaks for crashing enemies). If she crashes at least one enemy with this attack, she may use [[Glorious Carnage Typhoon]] again reflexively to make a decisive attack again, as above.
