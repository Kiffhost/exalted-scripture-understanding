*Having set in motion the events behind an inevitable betrayal, Tamokhet’s wielder brings them to their terrible conclusion.* 
## Resonant
Only wielders resonant with Tamokhet can awaken this Evocation. To use this Evocation, the wielder must have infected a character with the [[Doom of Tamokhet]] and had him spread it to a secondary target with [[The Treacherous World]]. She must have interacted with one of this pair within the last ([[Essence]]) days. She describes a scenario in which one of them betrays the other, making a special ([[Manipulation]] + {Socialize, [[Presence]] or Larceny}) influence roll against both characters’ [[Resolve]]. This ignores multiple target penalties and the need for a shared language. Characters whose [[Essence]] equals or exceeds the wielder’s add it to their [[Resolve]] as a non-Charm bonus. The wielder’s scenario can encompass the events of a single scene. She can specify the betrayal’s details, but not the betrayer’s motive, the behavior of anyone else, or any details unrelated to the betrayal. She could predict that a chef will poison his infected employer’s meal, but his reasons for doing so would be his own. Nor can she guarantee the ultimate outcome of the betrayal; that hinges on successful rolls, creative thinking, the assistance of allies, and other assets brought to bear by the two. The Storyteller can veto details about the betrayal that go too far, as with introducing facts (Exalted, p. 238). If the wielder beats the betrayed character’s [[Resolve]], fate ensures that the specified scenario occurs within a week, unless the wielder specifies a longer span. It plays out as close to the wielder’s description as possible under the circumstances. However, the traitor is only compelled to play out the scenario if the roll beats their [[Resolve]]. Otherwise, they only appear to have betrayed the infected character: a chef might use mushrooms that only resemble amanitas or inadvertently mistake one for the other. The traitor can also resist this Charm’s Psyche component by entering a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and citing an [[Intimacy]] whose intensity equals or exceeds that of both characters’ symptoms to pay one [[Willpower]]. If Tamokhet’s wielder ends this Evocation prematurely or loses attunement to Tamokhet, the foretold betrayal is averted. This also occurs if either victim is cured of the Doom before it comes to pass.
