*Violence begets violence, hastening the hand of Death’s Lawgiver as she reaps a harvest of souls.*
The Abyssal gains a special pool of [[Initiative]], which can only be used to pay the [[Initiative]] costs of [[Melee]] [[Charms]] and gambits. The pool begins empty each scene and can hold up to ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]]. This [[Initiative]] can’t be targeted by withering attacks and similar effects. She can use [[Melee]] [[Charms]] with the Perilous keyword while crashed if she pays their [[Initiative]] cost entirely from this pool. If they don’t have an [[Initiative]] cost, she can use them in crash as long as she has any [[Initiative]] in this pool.
When the Abyssal receives [[Initiative]] from a withering damage roll, she may transfer up to one point to this pool for each 10 on her damage roll. When she deals damage with a decisive attack, each 10 on the damage roll adds one [[Initiative]] to the pool.
The Abyssal can pay four motes, one [[Willpower]] after a withering damage roll that crashes its target or a decisive damage roll to gain [[Initiative]] for 9s as well. Alternatively, she can consume a soul imprisoned with [[Soul-Drinking Blade]] instead of paying this cost. Usually, this permanently destroys the soul, but it might survive at the Storyteller’s discretion, giving the deceased’s friends another chance to free his soul — and the Abyssal another chance to exploit it.
