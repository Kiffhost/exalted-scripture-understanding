*A foe’s seeming victory crumbles to ash as the Lunar’s presence steels her warriors’ flagging courage.*
When an allied battle group fails a rout roll or takes Magnitude damage, she reflexively makes a [[Charisma]]-based rally or rally for numbers roll, respectively. If successful, the enemy that routed or damaged the battle group loses (Lunar’s Essence/2, rounded up) [[Initiative]], which the Lunar gains. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
