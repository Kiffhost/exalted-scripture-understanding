*The martial artist’s fists blur as she pounds them against the air, infecting and shattering reality to unleash a storm of tainted Essence.*
The stylist creates a miasma of spiritual decay, an environmental hazard imbued with a disease from Feverish Essence Infection’s repertoire, with difficulty 5 and damage 4A/round. It must be resisted with (Stamina + Resistance), and damaged characters are exposed to the disease. Even inanimate matter is infected, with effects determined by the Storyteller. It extends out to short range; at the end of each turn after the one she used this Charm on, the hazard’s range increases by one band. This Charm ends if the stylist takes a non-reflexive actions, moves or is moved, or is crashed.
If left uninterrupted, the environmental hazard expands by one mile per hour, maximum (Essence) miles. At this point, the Storyteller need not make individual rolls for trivial characters caught in the storm; he can simply narrate the mass deaths and panic that result. A difficulty 2 (Perception + Occult) roll lets a character discern the storm is actively emanating from a source at its center.
## Enlightenment
While using this Charm, the stylist can sustain Flare of Invulnerability without needing to spend motes and waives the Willpower costs of Glorious Citrine Protection and Spiritual Perfection. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal using this style or Medicine.
