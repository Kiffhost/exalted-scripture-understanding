*The Infernal sculpts the cosmos by her will alone, working miracles from naught but necessity and desire.*

When the Infernal undertakes a sorcerous working, she gains the following benefits:
- She adds (Essence/2, rounded up) automatic successes on all rolls for it.
- Once per story, she can waive a working’s experience cost.
- She adds a +1 to the working’s terminus for any Means related to demons or Hell, maximum (Essence/2, rounded up). Examples include assistance from demons with complementary Abilities and sorcerous infrastructure in the Demon City.
- The Infernal can treat the sacrifice of a supernatural being as a Means for the working if its Essence equals or exceeds the working’s (Circle + 3). This is reduced to (Circle + 1) for Exalted sacrifices. She adds an additional +1 if the sacrifice’s Essence is at least two higher than the minimum.
