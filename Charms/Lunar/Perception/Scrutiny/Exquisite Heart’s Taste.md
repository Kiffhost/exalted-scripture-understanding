A bead of sweat glistening on a brow, a dilated pupil, or a slight irregularity of breath betrays the secrets of even the most stone-faced courtier. When the Lunar profiles a character or reads his intentions, his [[Guile]] is penalized by any of his Intimacies that support revealing the sought information as though it were his [[Resolve]]. This Charm is inapplicable against automatons, mindless undead, and similar beings. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Keen Nose, the Lunar also adds ([[Intimacy]]) bonus dice.
