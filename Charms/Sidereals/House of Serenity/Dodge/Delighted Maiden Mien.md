*Keeping things light and cheery, the Sidereal hides her worries behind a smile.*
The Sidereal can calculate Guile with (Appearance + Dodge). This doesn’t include any bonus dots of Appearance the Sidereal has.
With Dodge 4, Essence 2, the Sidereal can pay five motes to inflict +1 target number on a roll against her Guile. This becomes +2 if she’s acting in support of a Tie of romantic or sexual desire. This effect is Mute.
