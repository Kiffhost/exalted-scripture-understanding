Accepting betrayal as the price of her survival, the Sidereal deflects assaults upon her mind against those closest to her. When the Sidereal’s Resolve or opposed roll is beaten by a Psyche effect, she can defend against it by redirecting it against a character with a positive Major or Defining Tie to her, no matter how far away he may be. She can’t redirect it against a character already targeted by it. Mortals don’t recognize the Sidereal’s agency in this, but supernatural characters do; they can sacrifice their Tie to the Sidereal to avoid the redirected effect. She must then either contend against the effect herself or use this Charm again to redirect it against a different character. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by instilling an Exalt or other supernatural being with a positive Tie to the Sidereal and raising it to Defining intensity.
