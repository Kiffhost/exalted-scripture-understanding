## Resonant
Only characters resonant with the Revelation Sphere can awaken this Evocation.
As the wielder deftly twists the Revelation Sphere to solve its puzzle, the orichalcum bands locked around it slide and retract, their bindings no longer fettering the dreaming power that lies within. The runes etched on its surface drift into the air as shimmering patterns of azure light, surrounding her with ancient words of power. She gains the following benefits:
 - Any successes she adds on Shape Sorcery rolls or spell effect rolls with A Dream of Ancient Ice are non-Charm.
 - When she casts a spell enhanced by A Dream of Ancient Ice, its Willpower cost is reduced by one. This applies regardless of whether she enhanced a Shape Sorcery roll or a spell effect roll, or whether she added successes or spent them in place of motes.
 - At the end of each of her turns, if she succeeded on a Shape Sorcery roll or cast a spell, she gains one Initiative.
 - She doubles 9s on spell effect rolls for spells that enhance her senses, scry on distant things, or divine the past or future.
 - While shaping a spell, the runes grant Hardness (Perception + [Integrity, Lore, or Occult]).
A Dragon-Blooded Amilar scion who’s awakened this Evocation can use the Revelation Sphere as a Means for sorcerous workings that involves enhancing her senses, scrying, or revealing the past or future, adding +2 terminus. Other wielders may gain access to this benefit with a repurchase of this Evocation.
Gunzosha Armor (Artifact § - - - to § - - - - -) Ancient wonders of the First Age, gunzosha armor are more akin to Essence-powered armored exoskeletons than the artifact armors donned by the Second Age’s Exalted.
They’re puissant relics in the hands of the Chosen, but can also be attuned by mortals, allowing the First Age’s warlords to field entire armies of gunzosha. But this power carries a high price. Before a mortal can attune to gunzosha armor, she must have jade amulets surgically implanted across her body, allowing her to control the armor and draining her Essence to power it. As long as the amulets remain implanted, the rate at which she ages is doubled.
Lookshy’s arsenal boasts dozens of suits of gunzosha armor, more than any other single power in Creation. Seventh Legion military doctrine deploys gunzosha as elite troops reinforcing the field forces, attaching a fang of five gunzosha to a dragon, while also occasionally fielding smaller gunzosha detachments to support Dragon-Blooded officers.
However, Lookshy’s store of gunzosha armor is too small to allow every field force to have a full gunzosha complement; the Stores Directorate and the Directorate of the AdjutantGeneral coordinate unit allocation. The Stores Directorate is keenly aware of gunzosha armor’s irreplaceability and is loath to deploy gunzosha in circumstances where a fallen warrior’s armor might not be retrievable.
Lookshyan gunzosha candidates are selected from the field forces by the Directorate of the Adjutant-General, though service has not been compulsory outside of some of the darkest times in Lookshyan history. Given the severe toll the armor takes from its wearers, the General Staff’s current policy sets a ten-year maximum term of service, after which the gunzosha’s amulets are surgically removed. Gunzosha and former gunzosha hold considerable prestige in Lookshyan culture; their sacrifice exemplifies the Immaculate Faith’s Pillar of Conviction. The Seventh Legion’s Dragon-Blooded may not consider the gunzosha their equals, but few are without a healthy respect for them.
Gunzosha armor is heavy and ornate, made up of bulky, overlapping plates that cover the wearer’s entire body. These plates are inlaid with flowing script spelling out prayers for victory in battle and protection. The underside of each plate is covered with fine capillaries that act as an extension of the wearer’s musculature and route Essence from her implanted amulets to the armor — wonders beyond the Second Age’s artificers. Most of the gunzosha armors in Lookshy’s arsenal are primarily constructed from jade, but suits forged from other magical materials still exist today.
Gunzosha armor is heavy artifact armor (Exalted, p.
599). Mortals must pay five Willpower to attune to it, in place of committing motes. All of them share the universal gunzosha Evocations below, depicting the wearer’s proficiency with the armor’s integrated mechanisms, but each is still a unique and storied treasure, with unique Evocations reflecting its specific legend.
Like any other artifact armor, its rating can range from three dots to the fabled Artifact N/As, determining the power and number of that armor’s unique Evocations.
