The Dragon-Blood can lead her mount even to the ocean’s depths, dancing through rivers and seas as though born to them. Her mount can breathe water and is capable of swimming or running over riverbeds and sea floors at no penalty. Ride rolls to control it underwater double 9s. Note that this Charm doesn’t extend to the Dragon-Blood, who must use other magic such as the Water Aspect anima or Unbreathing Earth Meditation (p. 248) to survive underwater.
