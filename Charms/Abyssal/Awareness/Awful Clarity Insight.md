*Death has sharpened the Abyssalâ€™s senses, lending her perception inhuman clarity.*
The Abyssal doubles 9s on [[Awareness]] rolls.
Abyssal [[Awareness]] vs. Multiple Foes When the Abyssal uses the [[Awareness]] Excellency, she can pay a two-mote surcharge to extend its duration until her next turn, providing its bonus to all [[Awareness]] rolls she makes to detect hidden enemies. A number of [[Charms]] also specify that their duration can be extended this way. The Abyssal need only pay the two-mote surcharge once to extend the duration of all valid [[Charms]] she activates at the same time, including the Excellency.
