*The deathknight hangs in the air as if on spectral wings, gazing down on her victims before delivering them to their deaths.*
The Abyssal leaps up to three range bands straight up, floating in mid-air at its apex. While in the air, she can flurry ranged attacks with aim actions.
This Charm can only be used on the Abyssalâ€™s turn and uses her movement action. If there are any enemies within close range when she uses this Charm, she must make a disengage roll as part of this action to successfully ascend, adding ([[Essence]]) automatic successes.
When this Charm ends, the Abyssal descends gently to the ground without taking damage. If the Abyssal ends it prematurely to drop down and makes a non-ranged attack on the same turn, it receives the benefits of aiming.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal jumps or ascends beyond close range from the ground with a Charm or other effect, she can use this Charm to hang in mid-air, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost.
