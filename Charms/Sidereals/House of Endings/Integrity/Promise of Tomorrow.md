*The Sidereal may have no hopes, but Creation’s hopes for her sustain her.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm upon discerning an auspicious prospect to form a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of hope toward fulfilling it. This [[Intimacy]] can’t be weakened by any means except the Sidereal’s own [[Integrity]] [[Charms]]. Upon fulfilling the auspicious prospect, the Sidereal loses this [[Intimacy|Principle]] and rolls ([[Intimacy]]) dice. For each success, she may gain one [[Willpower]] or lose one [[Limit]]. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by fulfilling the chosen prospect.
