*No matter how an inferno scars the countryside, it leaves fertile soil ripe for the future.*
The Exalt ignores wound penalties, and may spend [[Willpower]] in place of health levels for the cost of Pyre of Legions’ [[Evocations]]. She’s treated as having a −4 wound penalty for [[Unstoppable Heart-Stoking Incandescence]]’s discount. 
This Evocation can only be activated once per story. This may be reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134). The [[Dawn]] Caste anima can’t reset this Evocation. 

## Special activation rules

This [[evocation]] cannot be awakened with experience points. It awakens at no cost if the wielder is reduced to her −4 health level while upholding [[Pyre of Legions]]’ [[Intimacy]].
