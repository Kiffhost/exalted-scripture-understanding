*Stalking through shade-darkened wilderness, Death’s Lawgiver discovers its secrets in the entrails of moldering carrion and the scent of decay carried on the wind.*
After a scene spent scouting or examining a wilderness locale, the Abyssal rolls ([Intelligence or Perception] + [[Survival]]) and banks scouting points equal to her successes. Within the scouted area, the deathknight can spend scouting points reflexively to use the following effects:
1 point: Use [[Pomegranates Full and Fine]] retroactively, revealing provisions gathered by the Abyssal while scouting.
1, 3, or 5 points: Declare the presence of an animal suitable to the region nearby. The cost depends on the animal’s familiar rating (Exalted, p. 161): one point for a one-dot familiar, three points for a two-dot familiar, or five for a three-dot familiar .
3 points: Declare the existence of a small terrain feature suitable to the region somewhere nearby, like a quicksand trap, a mountain stream, or the entrance to an underground cave.
5 points: Add (Essence/2, rounded up) successes on [[Awareness]], [[Sail]], [[Stealth]], [[Survival]], and [[War]] rolls within the region for one scene, or grant this benefit to an ally.
5 points: Use [[Weeping Sky Lamentation]] retroactively, causing the weather change to take place immediately if successful.
7 points: Use [[Dark Roads of the Dead]] reflexively and without needing to roll, revealing that the Abyssal’s already found a way into (or out of) the Underworld within the area.
The Abyssal must know any [[Charms]] enhanced with scouting points. Options that let her declare facts are subject to the same [[Storyteller]] discretion as facts introduced with [[Lore]] (Exalted, p. 237).
## Reset 
The Abyssal can only scout a locale once per session.
