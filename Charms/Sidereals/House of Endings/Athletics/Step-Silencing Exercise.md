The Sidereal omits sound from her movement, even the slightest footsteps dissipating into invisible smoke before they can be heard. The Sidereal becomes perfectly silent; rolls opposing her [[Stealth]] that are based solely on hearing fail automatically. She can also silence a movement action with any Ability, making it impossible to detect with hearing-based rolls. This doesn’t silence indirect consequences of the action, like a rotten timber collapsing under the Sidereal’s weight.
