*Even as her defenses falter, the terrible rage that burns in the Lunar’s [[Essence]] urges her onward.*
She makes a decisive attack while crashed, with base damage ([[Essence]] + 5 − {current Initiative/2, rounded up}) dice, minimum 1. For example, an [[Essence]] 5 Lunar at −4 [[Initiative]] would roll 8 dice of damage. If she hits, she resets to 0 [[Initiative]], instead of base [[Initiative]]. This Charm may only be used once per scene, unless reset by gaining 20+ [[Initiative]] on a single tick.
