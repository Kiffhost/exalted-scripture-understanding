Larceny covers a range of talents that fall under the general penumbra of criminal activity. Pickpocketing, lock picking, and sleight of hand are all uses of Larceny that rely on physical deftness, but it also applies to more intellectual tasks such as creating an effective disguise, hiding evidence at the scene of a crime, or navigating a societyâ€™s criminal underworld.

Larceny is specifically used for the following *crime* actions, as well as others at Storyteller's discretion.
