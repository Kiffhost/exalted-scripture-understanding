*The Abyssal’s arrow twists through the air in search of her prey.*
The Abyssal reduces an enemy’s Defense bonus from cover by one or inflicts −1 Defense on an enemy without cover.
If the attack benefits from aiming, it can strike enemies behind full cover, passing directly through the obstruction as long as there’s some opening for the attack to pass through. However, such enemies still receive +3 non-Charm Defense from the cover.
