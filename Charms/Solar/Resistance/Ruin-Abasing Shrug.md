Flesh imbued with impenetrable [[Essence]], the Solar turns aside harm with forceful derision. After damage is rolled, the Solar may use this Charm to force the attacking player to reroll, keeping their non-successes, rerolling only successful dice. Damage on this reroll cannot exceed that of the initial roll. This Charm can be used once per scene, but may be reset by taking no withering or decisive damage on three separate damage rolls.
