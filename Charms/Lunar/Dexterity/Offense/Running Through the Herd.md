Urged ever onward by predatory instinct, the Lunar cuts a crimson swath across the battlefield. When she uses Octopus-and-Spider Barrage or Thousand Claw Affliction, she may move one range band toward an enemy, and may do so again after each successful attack. This collectively counts as her move action, and she can’t do this if she’s already taken one. 
## Protean 

In shapes with more than four limbs, this Charm doesn’t count as the Lunar’s movement action.
