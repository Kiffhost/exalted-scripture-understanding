The Solar becomes automatically aware any time a curse or other magic is laid against her organization. She may not be aware of the exact details of such a power, or where it comes from, but she does know where to look for evidence using Investigation Charms or Bureau-Rectifying Method. At the moment the Solar first becomes aware of fell magic, the player may also guess as to its source if it is reasonable that the Solar would know what the player suspects. If correct, the Solar instantly knows the source of the magic and may use Bureau-Reforming Kata instantly. The Solar may, at the same time she uses Bureau-Reforming Kata, spend a number of motes equal to those used to launch the curse. By committing these motes, the Exalt traps the motes committed to the effect, preventing the source from relinquishing the curse before its normal duration has expired.
