The Sidereal need not go to great lengths to establish her scholarly credentials; her sagacity is a self-evident fact. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  She may reflexively make her scholarly eminence known to all who see her. Anyone who can perceive her becomes intuitively aware of all Lore backgrounds she possesses and regards her as the perfect expert to consult on matters involving them, treating this as a Minor Tie. 
-  When she successfully reads a character’s intentions or profiles him, she also learns one of his Lore backgrounds. 
-  Characters she teaches halve training times. 
-  At the end of each story, she gains a new Lore background based on that story’s events.
