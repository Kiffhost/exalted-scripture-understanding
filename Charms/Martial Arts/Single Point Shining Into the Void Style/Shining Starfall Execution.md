Committing fully to a lethal blow, the swordsman cleaves through her enemies with killing speed. Shining Starfall Execution adds (her Dexterity/2, round up) to the raw damage of a decisive attack. If she is at Initiative 15+, she adds her full Dexterity instead. However, if the attack misses, then the stylist adds (Dexterity /2) to the amount of Initiative she loses. 

## Mastery

Shining Starfall Execution also doubles 10s on the damage roll at Initiative 15+.
