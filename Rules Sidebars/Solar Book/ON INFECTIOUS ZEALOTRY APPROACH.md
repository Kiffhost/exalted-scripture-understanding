In [[Presence]], the Charm [[Mind-Wiping Gaze]] (p. 372) momentarily blanks out a characterâ€™s mind, erasing his social impetus. If used in combination with [[Infectious Zealotry Approach]], the character is rendered catatonic unless attacked. In this state, [[Hypnotic Tongue Technique]] (p. 372) or [[Memory-Reweaving Discipline]] (p. 363) may be used on the target without a [[Resolve]] check.
