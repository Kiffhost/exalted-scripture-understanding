Once, there was a maiden…
...who met a thing that lived outside the world,
and there was a beauty to it.
It burned with an unholy wrath that could destroy
Creation.
It hated her as much as it loved her.
Its kiss was blood and perfection, for its teeth
were sharp.
It offered her power, and with it, hooks to tear her
soul.
With care not to burn her fingers, she took it into
her life.
“Love is what you make of it,” said she.
