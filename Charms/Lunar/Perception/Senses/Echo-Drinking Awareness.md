*The Lunar reshapes her vocal cords and inner ears, perceiving the world through ultrasonic vibrations.*
She can “see” through echolocation, visualizing blackand-white images of everything out to long range even in zero visibility. Her echolocation penetrates walls and similar obstructions, so long as they aren’t airtight. Characters can still use [[Stealth]] against the Lunar, but she adds a success on rolls to detect them. If the Lunar enhances her hearing with SenseSharpening Change, its benefits also apply to rolls that would normally be vision-based. 
## Protean 

In shapes with [[Echolocation]], the Lunar instead doubles 9s on echolocation-based rolls, including [[Join Battle]] rolls. Unlike most Protean [[Charms]], this includes the Lunar’s true human shape.
