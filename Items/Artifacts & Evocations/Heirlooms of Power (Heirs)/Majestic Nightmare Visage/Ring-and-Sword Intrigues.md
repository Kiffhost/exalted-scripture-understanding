Majestic Nightmare Visage ever schemes against its wearer’s superiors, whispering of how they might be toppled from their thrones and made to bow before her. The wearer spends a scene plotting to depose, overthrow, or otherwise remove a character that she has a negative Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward — this Evocation’s target — from a position of political, social, or military authority. She rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [Bureaucracy, [[Larceny]], or Socialize]), gaining betrayal points equal to her successes. She may spend them on the following effects:
 - 1 Point: Waive Becoming Midnight’s Childe’s cost.
 - 3 Points: Add an automatic success on a roll opposing this Evocation’s target.
 - 3 Points: Gain +3 [[Guile]] against this Evocation’s target for one scene.
 - 5 Points: Waive the [[Willpower]] cost of resisting influence that opposes a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] to this Evocation’s target.
 - 5 Points: Treat the intensity of a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] this Evocation’s target has toward the wielder as one step higher against a single influence roll.
 - 5 Points: Treat the intensity of a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] a character has toward this Evocation’s target as one step lower against a single influence roll.
 - 5 Points: Waive Raiment of Sundered Truths’ [[Willpower]] cost when used against this Evocation’s target.
 - 7 Points: Waive Shadow-Prince Conspiracy’s cost to enact a secret agenda against this Evocation’s target.
 - 7 Points: When this Evocation’s target makes a roll opposing the wearer’s [[Guile]], a roll contesting her disguise as the Childe, or an [[Investigation]] roll to uncover evidence left by her, he automatically fails. The wearer’s player may use this effect even if the character is unaware.
This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] gained from [[Becoming Midnight’s Childe]].
## Dissonant
The wearer can’t use the seven-point effects.
## Resonant
The wearer doubles 9s on this Evocation’s activation roll.
[[Experience Debt]] Certain effects let player characters increase or gain new traits by incurring [[Experience Debt]] equal to the normal cost of purchasing those traits. Any experience points she subsequently receives go toward paying off the debt, until it’s paid in full. Until the debt’s fully paid, the character can’t benefit from other effects that cause [[Experience Debt]]. Storyteller characters never go into [[Experience Debt]].
