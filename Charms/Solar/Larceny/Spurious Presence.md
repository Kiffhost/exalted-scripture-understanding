Even amidst the Imperial Treasury, the Lawgiver projects her right to be there. This Charm makes it nearly impossible to voluntarily question the Exalt’s presence. As long as the Solar is dressed and behaving as expected for the present circumstances, she cannot normally be considered suspicious. Characters who do suspect something “off” about her may try to read her intentions, but the Exalt’s [[Guile]] is at +2 against such attempts. The player may reconstitute the character’s [[Guile]] using [[Larceny]] instead of [[Socialize]]; [[Charms]] that protect against read intentions actions are explicitly allowed to enhance this effect. Which characters suspect the Lawgiver depends entirely on the dramatic whim of the Storyteller.
