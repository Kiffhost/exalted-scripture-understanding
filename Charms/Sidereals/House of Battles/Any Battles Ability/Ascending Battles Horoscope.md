*The Sidereal proclaims Mars’ favor to warriors, generals, athletes, and hellraisers.*
The Sidereal blesses another character with good fortune in a certain kind of battle, conflict, or competition:
defending his home city, battling demons, prevailing in games of skill, etc. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one Willpower for others.
Blessing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options.
Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece.
Once per scene, the blessed character’s player may gain −1 target number on an attack roll, Join Battle roll, War roll, or roll relevant to nonviolent conflict in the chosen form of conflict.
Additionally, once per session, the blessed character’s player may invoke a stroke of good luck, making a dramatic edit (p. 157) to aid him in the chosen form of conflict.
### Excessive Valor Reward (The Banner)
The Sidereal’s target boasts about his accomplishments.
### Foretold Victory Blessing (The Quiver)
The Sidereal’s target heeds her advice in matters of tactics or strategy, whether on or off the battlefield. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively.
### Instructive Hostility Auspice (The Spear)
The Sidereal’s target argues, competes, spars, or fights with her.
### Soul-Strengthening Conviction (The Gauntlet)
The Sidereal’s target commits to making a risky or costly decision.
### Star-Favored Guardian (The Shield)
The Sidereal’s target puts himself in harm’s way for her.
The Sidereal can bless multiple characters with this Charm.
