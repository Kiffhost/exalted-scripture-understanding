*Pulling with insuperable strength, the Lunar plunges foes into roaring flames or drags them down to the uttermost depths.*
The Lunar need only sacrifice one round of grapple control to drag a grappled enemy. If she drags him into an environmental hazard or similarly imperils him, like dragging him off a cliff, he suffers a penalty equal to her remaining rounds of control on any roll to resist. On a failed roll, the Lunar can forgo any number of rounds of clinch control, adding two dice to the damage roll for each. Alternatively, if she drags him underwater, he halves his [[Stamina]] for determining how long he can hold his breath (Exalted, p. 232) while she controls the grapple.
If the Lunar uses [[Mangling Grasp Might]] to throw an enemy into an environmental hazard or similar peril, she may use this Charm to enhance it, inflicting a penalty equal to the rounds of control forfeited. Likewise, she may also use it if releasing an enemy endangers him — e.g., if she does so while flying at long range above the ground.
With a [[Strength]] 5, [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Lunar can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to cause her foe to automatically fail his roll against any peril she drags him into.
