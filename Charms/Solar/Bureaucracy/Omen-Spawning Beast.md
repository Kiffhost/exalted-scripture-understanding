The Solar becomes fused with her organization at the unconscious level. Her Essence flows through all aspects of her bureaucracy, subtly altering her existence as she alters it in turn. If the Exalt has captured magic using WoeCapturing Web, this Charm allows her to discover profiling information among her immaculately-kept paperwork, revealing the identity of the one whose magic has been snared.
