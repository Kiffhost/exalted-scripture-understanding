This action *must* be taken when a character at close range with one or more hostile opponents wishes to retreat to [[Range#Short]]—the standard reflexive [[#Move]] action cannot be used to do so. 

Disengaging is an [[Dice Rolls#Opposed roll|opposed roll]] of ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]]) against the ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) of all opponents who wish to contest the disengage action. Taking this action causes the character to lose 2 [[Initiative]] points regardless of its success.

If the character defeats all of his opponents, then he moves out to short range; furthermore, if one of the opponents he disengaged moves toward him on her next turn, the character immediately and reflexively retreats one further range band away from her, even if this means he would move outside of his turn. Like a [[#Rush]] action, this [[Action#Reflexive|reflexive]] movement does not count as a [[Movement]] action. It occurs only the first time after a disengage action that a disengaged opponent moves toward the character.

If any opponent beats the character’s disengage roll, he is incapable of moving away—there’s simply no opportunity for the character to safely escape his enemies.
