When this white cabochon is slotted into an attuned hearthstone socket, it grants the opportunity to awaken the following Evocation:
Body of Marble Cost: 3m; Mins: Essence 1
Type: Reflexive
Keywords: None
Duration: One scene
Prerequisites: None
The Exalt is sheathed in a second skin as hard and glossy as polished marble. She gains three soak and Hardness 3. When she takes decisive damage, the stony shell flakes away as the Evocation ends. This Evocation may only be used once per scene. It can be reset by recovering from Initiative Crash.
