*Gathering her [[Essence]], the Abyssal leaps to the sky with a horrible screaming sound, her passage carving a bloody red cut through the sky.*
The Abyssal can use her movement action to make a tremendous leap on her turn, jumping up to four range bands horizontally or three range bands vertically. She can’t jump fewer than three range bands normally, but using [[Spider Pounce Technique]] lets her make a controlled jump of two range bands. Such leaps can’t be flurried, but the deathknight can make one reflexively on the turn she uses this Charm.
If there are any enemies within close range when the Abyssal leaps, she must make a disengage roll with ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) to do so.. If she succeeds, enemies within close range whose opposed rolls failed by 2+ successes fall prone. Trivial enemies automatically fall prone.
