The Sidereal’s kind eyes, soothing words, and gentle touch soothe the hearts of those under her care. When the Sidereal speaks soothingly, comforts, or holds a character before he sleeps, she rolls (Charisma + Linguistics), banking her successes as a pool of bonus dice for him and granting him Willpower equal to her 10s. For that night’s sleep, he adds (Sidereal’s Essence) Guile and Resolve against magic that observes or intrudes on his dreams. The comforted character may add up to (Sidereal’s Charisma) banked dice on influence rolls to speak plainly and openly about strong feelings and difficult topics and rolls opposing disease, poison, and other ailments. He can also spend them to raise his Resolve, expending two dice per +1 bonus. Enhanced rolls ignore penalties from fear-based effects. This lasts (Sidereal’s Essence) days.
