Moonlit Cauldron Apothecary The Lunar hunts Creation’s myriad ills to their hiding place, dragging them from the darkness with fangs of burning knowledge. After her roll reduces a poison’s duration to zero or overcomes a Defining-level disease’s morbidity with 3+ extra successes, she expels the affliction entirely from her patient as a spirit. For illnesses, this a disease spirit (Exalted, p. 509). For poisons, the Storyteller can alter a disease spirit’s traits to reflect poison, use another appropriate spirit’s traits, or invent new traits. The spirit’s power is commensurate with that of the ailment he originated from, though his [[Essence]] can’t exceed the Lunar’s. The spirit has a Defining Tie of loyalty toward the Lunar, which can’t be weakened or altered for a season. His advice is exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) on rolls to diagnose, treat, or resist the ailment, introduce facts about how to combat it, or implement plans based on such facts. If the Lunar uses [[Moonlit Cauldron Apothecary]] (p. XX) to introduce a cure for that ailment while advised by the spirit, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost. Once the spirit’s season of service elapses, he no longer provides these benefits. The Lunar can only have one spirit bound with this Charm at a time; binding a new one requires releasing any previous spirit from his season of service. A Lunar with [[Midnight Soul Reprieve]] (p. XX) can use this Charm after lowering a patient’s [[Derangement]] from Defining to Minor intensity, fully curing her patient and expelling that [[Derangement]] as a spirit. A [[Derangement]] spirit’s advice counts as exceptional equipment, as above, and waives the [[Willpower]] cost of using [[Midnight Soul Reprieve]] to treat the same [[Derangement]]. A Lunar with Heaven-Darkening [[Eclipse]] (p. XX) can use this Charm after introducing a way to negate an effect with 3+ extra successes. She successfully negates it, twisting the sundered magic’s remnants into a spirit. Such spirits don’t grant the above benefits, but have supernatural powers antithetical to the god whose miracle was negated or the sorcerous effect negated.
