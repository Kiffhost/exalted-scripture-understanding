*The Dragon-Blood reinforces her body with unyielding Earth [[Essence]] to accomplish mighty deeds.*
She gains one bonus dot of [[Strength]] as long as she remains standing on the ground or a natural stone surface. This increases her effective [[Strength]] to determine what feats of strength she can attempt, as well as adding one bonus die on [[Strength]]-based rolls and to withering damage rolls.
