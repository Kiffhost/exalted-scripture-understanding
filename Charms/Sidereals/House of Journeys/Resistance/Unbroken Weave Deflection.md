Weapons ring and ricochet off the Siderealâ€™s iron fate. The Sidereal clashes an attack against her with a ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) disarm gambit. Ranged attacks can be clashed, but attackers aren't disarmed and the Sidereal doesn't pay [[Initiative]]. The same's true for unarmed attacks. While using [[Forward-Thinking Technique]], the Sidereal can clash ambushes with this Charm. She can use [[Charms]] to enhance the clash attack normally, but can't use other [[Charms]] to defend against the gambit.
