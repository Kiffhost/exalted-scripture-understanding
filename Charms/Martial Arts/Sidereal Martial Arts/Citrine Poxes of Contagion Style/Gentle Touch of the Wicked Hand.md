Infusing Essence into pressure points and meridians corrupted by disease, the stylist ignites a conflagration of decay that consumes her victim from within. The stylist makes a decisive attack against a diseased enemy with base damage ([Essence x Intensity] + attack roll extra successes), ignoring Hardness. This doesn’t include or reset her Initiative. The stylist need only touch her victim; noticing the attack requires a (Perception + Medicine) roll against a difficulty of her (Manipulation + Medicine). She can make an ambush (Exalted, p. 203) without needing to establish concealment as long as her victim is willing to let her touch him. Enlightenment: The stylist may add her Initiative to the attack’s damage, resetting if she hits. Reset: This Charm can only be used once per scene unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the stylist’s Initiative and then crashing a diseased enemy.
