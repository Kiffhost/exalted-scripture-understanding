The Lawgiver reaches beyond herself to touch the creative energy that lies just beyond her reach. This Charm may be used once per story, allowing the Solar the use of (Essence or three, whichever is greater) Craft Charms she has yet to learn. The Solar does not need to meet the Essence minimums for these Charms, though she must still meet the Ability minimum. Also, she must know the prerequisite of each Charm she wishes to use. Charms enabled by Bright-Forging Prana do count as the prerequisites of other Charms the Solar might enable through use of this Charm. Once Bright-Forging Prana has been used, the Solar must pay the activation cost of each Charm. Charms enabled by Bright-Forging Prana may be used for the rest of the story, but only on the project they were initially employed for. Bright-Forging Prana does not function to give the Solar automatic craft point bonuses from Charms such as Peerless Paragon of Craft.
