*Death’s Lawgiver brings even the fiercest beasts to heel with her terrifying presence and eternal tenacity.*
The Abyssal adds ([[Essence]]) automatic successes on a roll to train an animal (Exalted, p. 554) and shortens the interval for one week. She waives the usual specialty requirements. While using [[Superior Predator Style]], she ignores penalties for working with wild or hostile animals.
With [[Survival]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal can train a familiar that she’s enhanced with [[Fetter the Beast]] to teach it a magical ability for two experience points.
