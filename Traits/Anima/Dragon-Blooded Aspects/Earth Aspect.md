Earth is the foundation of Creation, the mighty pillar that upholds all things. Earth is unassailable, enduring both physical force and the taint of chaos. Its stability keeps the balance of the world, from the mountains that have weathered centuries unchanged to the purity of cold iron. When storms fade, rivers dry up, fires burn out, and forests die, only the unforgiving earth remains. 

Those who Exalt as Earth Aspects inherit the stoic calm and enduring stability of their element. They turn their minds from trifles and ill-conceived dreams as they come to appreciate the importance of ritual and tradition, the tried and tested wisdom passed down across generations of Dragon-Blooded. They value that which lasts, whether it’s a long-standing relationship with a lover or friend, constructing a manse that will weather the passing of ages, or inflicting a total defeat from which a foe can never hope to recover. They’re slow to make up their minds, but unshakable in their conviction once they’ve done so.

The Children of Pasiap stand firm in body, mind, and soul, enduring the waves of adversity without bending or breaking. They’re capable of withstanding both immense physical pain and temptations of the will, refusing to yield in defense of their allies on the battlefield or the traditions they’ve devoted themselves to upholding. As generals and tacticians, the foundation of their battle plans is ancient wisdom such as The Thousand Correct Actions of the Upright Soldier. As architects and artisans, they create long-lasting marvels, and sense those flaws that are in need of repair.

An [[Earth Aspect]] is a pillar of strength to her Sworn Kin, supporting them with her iron will and the firmness of her convictions. She understands the value of the ancient tradition of the Sworn Kinship, and strives to uphold harmony and balance within it. She may be called on to play the part of arbiter, judge, or disciplinarian when her Hearth is shaken by strife. So too do they maintain the strength and stability of Dragon-Blooded societies, upholding those traditions that have seen it prosper through the ages and mending those things that are flawed. 

# Aspect Markings

An Earth Aspect’s skin can be pale like marble, brown like soil, or gray like stone. They smell of moist clay or freshly turned loam, and their eyes can take on a gemlike appearance, sparkling like sapphires or emeralds. Some have hardened or textured skin, ranging from chalky to exceptionally smooth to rough and pebbled. Dust may rise from their footfalls. 
# Anima Banner

[[Earth Aspect]] animas burn with a steady white or yellow light that might shift like rolling sands or glimmer like a perfect diamond. Some rumble with the earthshaking might of a landslide or earthquake, or pulse like the heartbeat of a volcano. Their iconic animas often take the form of earth dragons, mountains or stone towers, or animals like badgers or bulls. 
# Anima Effects

Earth Aspects are resilient against attacks, persist through ailment or injury, and channel seismic force through their anima flux (p. 154). 
- For five motes, the [[Earth Aspect]] adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) natural soak and +1 [[Hardness]] until her next turn, as well as gaining +1 [[Defense]] against smash attacks and grapple gambits as a non-Charm bonus. At bonfire, this power is free.
- For three motes, the [[Earth Aspect]] ignores one point of penalty from wounds, poison, or crippling for a single tick.
- The Dragon-Blood may spend two [[Initiative]] when she rolls anima flux to either knock all damaged foes prone or knock them one range band away from her.
