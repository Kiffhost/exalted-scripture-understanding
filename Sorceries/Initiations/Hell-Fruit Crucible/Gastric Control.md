The sorcerer has inhuman control of her digestive processes. She may instantly and fully digest anything in her stomach at will, regardless of whether it’s edible. Any ingested poisons apply damage for all remaining intervals before being purged. She can also suspend her digestion for up to (Stamina) hours, incidentally suspending the duration of any ingested poisons until she resumes digestion.
