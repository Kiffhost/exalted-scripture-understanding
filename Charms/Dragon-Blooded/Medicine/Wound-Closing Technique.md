*The Dragon-Blood spends fifteen minutes tending to a patient’s wounds, at the end of which she rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]).*
Each success converts a single level of lethal damage to bashing, speeding the rate at which it heals (Exalted, p. 173). Alternatively, if she rolls successes equal to (her patient’s wound penalty + 1), she may heal a single level of bashing damage. Once a character has been treated with [[Wound-Closing Technique]], he must receive at least a day of bedrest or fully heal all damage before he can benefit from it again.
