*The Abyssal lines up a shot with a deftness and precision that puts all living flesh to shame.*
The Abyssal ignores penalties from non-visual conditions on an attack roll and can attack out to extreme range, limited only by her ability to perceive her foe. Withering attacks calculate their [[Accuracy]] bonus as their target was at short range.
