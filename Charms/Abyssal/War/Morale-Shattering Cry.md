*The Abyssal’s war cry is joined by the wails of the dead, breaking the will of her foes.*
The Abyssal imposes a −3 penalty on a rout check made by an enemy battle group within long range. For living battle groups, 1s on the rout check subtract successes. Rally rolls to avoid dissolution suffer the same penalties.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can enhance a threaten roll or other fear-based influence roll, inflicting −1 Resolve against living targets, or −2 for mortals. She ignores multiple target penalties.
With War 5, Essence 4, the Abyssal gains one Willpower if the battle group suffers dissolution, maximum once per scene.
