*Fear and obsession turn a false diagnosis into a life-threatening ailment, as if beckoning blackfeathered disease spirits, to roost in a victim’s body.*
Characters who suffer from [[Creeping [[Plague]] Suggestion]] suffer as though they were actually infected with a disease at the same intensity as their Obsession. [[Diagnosis]] rolls can’t see through the false symptoms unless enhanced by magic.
Characters with [[Exalted Healing]] may pay (Obsession) [[Willpower]] to resist the disease’s symptoms for one session.
