The Dragon-Blood channels her boundless vitality into her limbs as she strikes. She adds (Stamina) either to the raw damage of a withering attack, or as bonus dice to the control roll of a clinch. In Wood Aura, if the Dragon-Blood reaches her dice limit (p. 162) on a grapple control roll, she adds an additional non-Charm success.
