*Her body swelling with supernatural might, the Lunar expands into the form of one of Creation’s greatest beasts.*
She shapeshifts into an animal form with Legendary [[Size]]. At the end of each subsequent turn, if she didn’t make a decisive attack or spend 8+ motes on offensive magic, she must pay five motes, or this Charm ends. Outside of combat, she must pay five motes every hour. If the Lunar uses this  Charm to shift from one Legendary [[Size]] form to another, she waives its activation cost, maintaining the original 15-mote commitment. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Legendary [[Size]] may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm.
