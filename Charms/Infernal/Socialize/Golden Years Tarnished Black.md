*The Infernal desecrates the past, bringing all happy memories to ruin.*

The Infernal verbally prompts someone to recall memories about something. (“You seem so happy with him.” “What was your childhood like?” “Congratulations on your promotion!”). Her words seem innocuous enough, but convey a special (Manipulation + {Presence or Socialize} instill roll. Onlookers don’t realize that she’s employing any form of influence.

If the Infernal succeeds, she corrupts one of the target’s positive memories of a single scene related to the topic. Her victim misremembers the ruined memory in the worst possible light, ignoring or omitting anything good about that experience. She thinks the worst of everyone involved in the scene, particularly anyone she could blame for some harm or indignity done to her. This never introduces outright fabricated memories — it only alters the victim’s perspective of what actually happened.

If the victim has a positive Intimacy related to the ruined memory, it’s weakened by one step. If this fully removes a Minor Intimacy, the victim gains a negative Intimacy related to the memory, chosen by his player. The same is true if he doesn’t have a relevant positive Intimacy to resist.

The victim can pay three Willpower to resist, but only if he’s given strong reason to believe his memories aren’t right. He can’t take anyone involved in the scene at their word for this. Even if dozens of his friends disagree with him about the events of last night, it will still take more for him to resist — perhaps a corroborating account from a teahouse proprietor who observed them.
## Reset
The Infernal can’t use this Charm against the same character more than once per story.
## [[Keys]] 
#### Everything Gets Worse
The Infernal can distort negative memories, accentuating and exaggerating its worst details to create or strengthen negative Intimacies associated with it. If the Infernal’s familiar with the remembered event, she can also distort the memory to assign blame to someone who could plausibly be responsible. Doing so causes the target to form a negative Minor Tie toward the scapegoat or weaken a positive Tie by one step in addition to the other effects.
#### Glories That Never Were ([[#Everything Gets Worse]])
The Infernal can distort negative memories, erasing or minimizing unpleasant details. This weakens negative Intimacies or creates positive ones. If her target breaks free of this, he’s overcome with despair as the memories return, distorting them like [[#Everything Gets Worse]]. This costs only one Willpower to resist, which doesn’t require evidence of distorted memories.
#### Unreasoning Prejudice Infliction (+5m)
For a five-mote surcharge, the Infernal’s victim must pay three Willpower to voluntarily strengthen a Tie weakened by this Charm, or vice versa. If he has an Intimacy instilled by this Charm, he can’t spend Willpower to resist the underlying Psyche effect until that Intimacy is fully removed.
#### Twisted Yesterdays Curse ([[#Unreasoning Prejudice Infliction (+5m)|Unreasoning Prejudice Infliction]]) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to affect all of her victim’s memories that are related to the chosen topic. He can still spend Willpower to resist this, but doing so only cleanses his memories of a single scene. Once he does so (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) times, all his memories are restored. This key isn’t compatible with [[#Tainted History Remembrance (Essence 4) (+1wp)|Tainted History Remembrance]].
#### Tainted History Remembrance (Essence 4) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to target multiple characters with this influence. She prompts them all with the same topic, affecting only those who have relevant memories to corrupt.
#### Memory Poison Mastery (Essence 5, [[#Twisted Yesterdays Curse ( Unreasoning Prejudice Infliction (+5m) Unreasoning Prejudice Infliction ) (+1wp)|Twisted Yesterdays Curse]]) (+10m)
For a ten-mote surcharge, the Infernal can fully erode a positive Major Intimacy and instill a negative Major Intimacy in its place. If her target is a mortal, a First Circle demon, or has no temporary Willpower remaining, she can fully erode a positive Defining Intimacy and instill a negative Defining Intimacy. This isn’t compatible with [[#Tainted History Remembrance (Essence 4) (+1wp)|Tainted History Remembrance]]. This key can’t be used against a character more than once per story.
