Calling upon her bond to each weapon in her arsenal, the Thousand Blades master wreathes them in their own iconic displays of power.
The stylist may pay a ten-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Thousand Blades Form to gain the following benefits:  - She adds (Arsenal/2, rounded up) to her base Initiative and to the Initiative she receives for crashing enemies.
 - With Arsenal 3+, she may pay three Initiative to make a decisive counterattack once per round.
With Arsenal 5+, she may reflexively clash instead of counterattacking.
 - She can defend against environmental hazards with Parry instead of an opposed roll.
 - Weapons wielded with Thousand Blades Unsheathed can’t be disarmed or damaged.
While using this Charm, the stylist’s weapons radiate light as a bonfire anima (Exalted, p. 175) 

## Special activation rules

If the stylist uses Thousand Daiklave Wings together with this Charm, she waives that Charm’s Willpower cost.

## Mastery
Weapons wielded with Thousand Blades Unsheathed are immune to Shaping effects. With Arsenal 5+, the stylist can block unblockable attacks.

## Terrestrial
The stylist adds only +1 to her base Initiative and Initiative Breaks. Counterattacking or clashing counts as her attack for the round.
Toad Style Toad style emphasizes defense above all else. Its stylists wear no armor, but their skin is said to be hard as iron.
They go through grueling training regimens to toughen their bodies, enduring countless repeated blows until they can withstand them without flinching. Students also eat a variety of poisons and venoms to cultivate resilience and heighten their understanding of toxins. Some even develop the Venomous Merit (Exalted, p. 167) as a result.
This style is widely practiced throughout the East, Southwest, and the Blessed Isle, and in parts of the West. It’s sometimes known as Frog style, especially in tropical Eastern forests where colorful poison dart frogs thrive. Its defensive techniques are sometimes studied to complement other styles; Snake and Mantis are common combinations.
Toad Style Weapons: Toad style’s offense focuses on delivering a single powerful blow rather than rapid flurries, using punches, palm strikes and kicks. It’s incompatible with weapons.
Armor: Toad style is incompatible with armor.
Complementary Abilities: Resistance is key to Toad style’s defense. The style’s Charms don’t use Medicine, but it’s good to have if you’re going to poison yourself.
