Size is simple—it measures how big a [[Battle Group]] is, in terms of how many fighters are in it. The greater a battle group’s [[Size]], the harder it hits and the tougher it is; [[Size]] is the single greatest source of a battle group’s power. 

Battle groups enjoy a bonus to their [[Attack]] rolls, [[Attack#raw damage|damage]], [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]], and [[Soak]] equal to their [[Size]]. Thus, a [[Size]] 3 battle group adds +3 to its attack pools, +3 to its raw damage, +3 to its soak, and has 3 extra points of [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]].
# [[Size]] 0
One or two fighters. These should be modeled as individual combatants, not as a battle group. Any battle group reduced to [[Size]] 0 through [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] loss effectively ceases to exist—all of its members are either dead, fled, or surrendered. 
# [[Size]] 1
A small group: a half-dozen thugs in an alley, a fang of Realm legionnaires, a bar brawl, ten Dune People lying in wait beneath the sand. A dozen or fewer combatants. 
# [[Size]] 2
A modest group: a late-night lynch mob, a scale of Realm legionnaires, a Harborhead war-band, an aristocrat’s house guard. Several dozen combatants. 
# [[Size]] 3
A moderate group: a mercenary company, a talon to a wing of Realm legionnaires, a sweeping riot, a war band of the Fair Folk. Over a hundred combatants. 
# [[Size]] 4
A large group: a mercenary army, a dragon of Realm legionnaires, an entire Delzahn clan and its bannermen rallied to war, most of a small town slain and raised as the undead soldiers of an Abyssal. Several hundred combatants. 
# [[Size]] 5
A full army: two dragons of Realm legionnaires, a barbarian horde, a city-annihilating plague of fae or undead. Over a thousand combatants. 

If appreciably more than a [[Size]] 5 battle group worth of combatants are present, they are represented by creating an additional battle group (or groups). 20 extra combatants are a drop in the bucket, but if an extra 300 are present, that’s worth starting up a second [[Size]] 3 battle group.
