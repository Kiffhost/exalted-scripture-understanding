The duel opens its wielder’s eyes to the truths revealed about someone fighting for what he believes in. After successfully parrying an attack, the wielder can use this Evocation to read her attacker’s intentions, adding (Brawl) bonus dice on the roll. Success reveals the Intimacy that is that character’s primary reason for fighting — not only in the present battle, but more generally. This might include a Tie of vengeance, a Principle of defending the weak, or a Tie to his sifu. 

## Resonant

If the wielder successfully uncovers one of her chosen opponent’s Intimacies, she may commit this Evocation’s cost to add bonus dice on all withering attack rolls against him for the rest of the scene depending on its strength: +5 for no Intimacy, +4 for Minor, +3 for Major, and +2 for Defining. The blade delivers harsher blows against opponents who fight for weak reasons.
