*Compared to the corrosive, cosmic power of the Yozis, most diseases bore the Infernal Exalted.*

The Infernal purges herself of disease through infection. Her skin becomes covered in boils and begins to liquefy, as if she suffered from green sun wasting (p. XX). During this time, she suffers a −3 penalty on all rolls, and successes instead of dice on Appearance rolls. (She doesn’t suffer the disease’s usual symptoms).

Once the scene ends, the Infernal recovers and sloughs away her diseased flesh and rolls (Stamina + Resistance), adding (higher of Essence or 3) automatic successes. She can allocate her successes among any diseases she suffers from, curing those whose morbidity she beats. If she already suffered from green sun wasting before using this Charm, she only needs a single success to cure it.
## Reset
If the Infernal fails to purge a disease, she can’t use this Charm against it again for the day.
## [[Keys]]
#### Incinerating Fever Fury (Resistance 5, Essence 2) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to apply her roll against the morbidity of each disease she suffers from, rather than having to allocate successes among them.
#### Untouchable Blight-Flame Crucible (Resistance 5, Essence 3, [[#Incinerating Fever Fury (Resistance 5, Essence 2) (+1wp)|Incinerating Fever Fury]]) (1wp)
The Infernal can pay one Willpower after successfully purging a disease and commit this Charm’s cost indefinitely to become immune to each purged disease. She adds (Stamina) successes on rolls against the virulence and morbidity of other diseases. The Willpower cost is waived if the Infernal enhanced the roll with [[#Incinerating Fever Fury (Resistance 5, Essence 2) (+1wp)|Incinerating Fever Fury]]. If the Infernal subsequently uses [[Blight Internalization Transcendence]] against another disease, she gains immunity to it without needing to use this key again.
