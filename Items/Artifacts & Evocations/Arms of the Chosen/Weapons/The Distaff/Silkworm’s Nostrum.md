The Distaff’s threads take easily to Solar healing magic. When using its threads to form bandages, compresses, dressings, sutures, or the like, the cost of the following Charms is reduced by two motes or two Initiative: Wound-Mending Care Technique, Wound-Cleansing Meditation, Instant Treatment Methodology, and Wholeness-Restoring Meditation (Exalted, pp. 342-344). In addition, when performing long-term treatment using Wholeness-Restoring Meditation, the wielder may commit the Charm’s mote cost to weave a willing patient into a salubrious silken cocoon called the Panchrest Chrysalis that accelerates his healing manyfold, reducing the interval to one week. The patient falls into trance, unaware of the world and needing no nourishment.
