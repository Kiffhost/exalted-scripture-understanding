*The Infernal cannot help but pity the doomed, nor resist the dark delight of witnessing their downfall.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when an Investigation roll reveals that another character is imperilled by some long-term threat, looming disaster, or other doom. She gains a Major Tie toward that character of fascination, obsession, love, or the like, which she can’t voluntarily weaken. As long as she has it, she gains the following benefits:
- She adds a non-Charm success on Awareness and Investigation rolls to uncover threats to the chosen character and on Awareness or Investigation rolls to examine such threats.
- She gains +2 Resolve against influence that would cause her to abandon, ignore, or neglect the chosen character.
- She gains +2 Resolve against influence that would cause her to do anything to protect against the threat, mitigate it, or otherwise aid the chosen character or dealing with it.
- Her Tie counts as a valid Intimacy for [[Implacable Nemesis Insight]].

If the doom revealed by the Infernal’s investigation comes to pass, she rolls (higher of Essence or 3) dice upon learning of it. Each success grants her one Willpower and removes one Limit.
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset when a chosen character meets his doom. If the Infernal maintains this Charm for multiple stories, she must wait until the current story ends for it to reset.
