*The Sidereal’s piercing scrutiny discerns the subtle tracks left by thoughts, words, and abstract qualia.*
On a successful tracking roll, the Sidereal also learns a relevant and useful fact about her quarry, plus an additional such fact for every three extra successes: his intended destination, his emotional state when he left the tracks, his physical appearance, etc. She can oppose magical concealment that’s otherwise perfect, like a Solar’s [[Traceless Passage]].
