*The Dragon-Blood empties her mind of all distraction, dispersing the dark clouds of forgetfulness and ignorance so that she might answer a conundrum with the totality of her knowledge.*
After a scene spent in contemplation, she makes a roll to introduce a fact that !!doesn’tneedtobebasedonanyofherLorebackgrounds.!! Instead, she draws this knowledge forth by collating an entire lifetime of memories, piecing together fragments of information and intuitions to reveal a greater whole. The Storyteller may still veto the introduction of a fact (Exalted, pp. 237-238), refunding this Charm’s cost, if it would compromise the narrative of the game, or if a player proposes a fact that not even this Dragon-Blood’s entire lifetime of memories could reveal. Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood may use this Charm to free herself from a Psyche effect that alters her memories, such as the Solar Charm [[Memory-Reweaving Discipline]]. She rolls as though [[introducing a fact]] with this Charm against a difficulty of (the [[Essence]] + [[Manipulation]] of the character that used the effect). On a success, she gradually begins recovering her true, unaltered memories; for each day that passes, a single month’s worth of memories are restored. Multiply this rate by (her threshold successes + 1). This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by discovering an important secret or piece of information in a way that either upholds one of the Dragon-Blood’s Defining Principles or achieves a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170). No reset is needed if the Storyteller vetoes a proposed fact.
