T*hrough repeated treatment, the Lawgiver can restore lost tissue, and may even challenge congenital debilitation. Correcting some forms of blindness or deafness can be done in as little as an hour. The Solar can recalibrate optic tissues under a compact of earth, while ear bones align themselves to the movements of her fingertips.*
Such a feat is usually impossible, but the Exalt may roll (Intelligence + Medicine) against difficulty 5 to heal such conditions. Regrowth of lost or missing tissues is a much more challenging affair, as is the repair of deformities, Wyld mutation or mental Derangements. However, the Solarâ€™s prowess is such that of these, only Derangements cannot be fully cured. 
In each case, the Storyteller should decide if the wound, malady or defect is Minor, Major, or Defining. Defining would include paralysis, lost limbs, missing eyes, complete lunacy, and mutations that renders a person completely incapable of a normal human life. The Solar must dedicate four hours a month to treating such conditions through whatever medical means and stunts seem appropriate. This begins an extended roll with a goal of 20, an interval of one month and a difficulty of 5.
*Under wraps, earth compacts, and acupuncture, a Solar can rebuild the lost tissues of destroyed eyes and missing limbs, and can even aid a target in growing organs that he was born without.* 
Each time the Solar succeeds at the goal number, the malady decreases in intensity. Once it the goal has been met at the Minor level, a condition vanishes. Missing limbs are fully regrown, paralysis victims are able to walk, mutations wither and slough away or become easily operable. Only Derangements remain at the Minor level, though the Solar may continue to treat her patient at the Minor level to keep his symptoms at bay.
