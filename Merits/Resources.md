This Merit describes a character’s finances. Each dot represents an economic bracket and grants a standard income.
The source of this wealth must be detailed (rents on property, sharecropping, government stipend, banditry), since it may vary as the game plays out. Most Exalted have little difficulty accumulating some Resources if they wish, but it often makes the most sense when taken in concert with another Merit like Backing or Cult.
One dot indicates less than 1 shekel a year in jade, less than 64 koku a year in cash, or less than 60 dinars a year in silver—up to four times the expected income of a household with two skilled working adults (see “The Silver Standard,” p. 77). It’s appropriate to agrarian landlords, respected mortal craftsmen or artisans, renowned performers, successful small merchants, mid-ranking criminals in urban cartels, or local government officials.
Two dots indicates roughly a mina per year in jade, 128 koku in cash, or 100 dinars in silver—around twice the income provided by the previous level. It’s appropriate for urban slumlords, gang bosses, high-ranking local government officials, famous mortal artisans and performers, successful regional trade investors, or the stipend of a Realm patrician.
Three dots indicates a talent or less per year in jade; 8,000 koku in cash; or under 5 talents per year in silver—more than fifty times the income of the previous level. This level of Resources represents a take in the spoils of empire. It’s the income of the heads of established patrician houses, large cartels, or Guild merchant princes, and is also the usual discretionary stipend or income for Dynasts. These characters are usually economies unto themselves, with entourages who help manage their assets and depend on them for a living. Beyond three dots, it’s unusual for a fortune to be measured in cash—most of the independently wealthy bond their riches in silver or real or ledger jade.
Four dots indicates an income of 4-6 talents per year in jade; 16,000-50,000 koku per year in cash; or 20-30 talents per year in silver. Successful Dynasts and well-off patricians sometimes possess this level of Resources, as do successful Guild merchant princes, the most fortunate scavenger lords, rulers of small Threshold states, and mortal craftsmen with skills of singular value to the Chosen—for example, renowned mortal manse architects.
Five dots indicates an income of 12-20 talents per year in jade; 96,000-160,000 koku per year in cash; or 60-100 talents per year in silver. The heads of the richest patrician families, renowned and successful Dynasts (often serving vital positions within their Houses), established Guild factors, and the rulers of powerful Threshold kingdoms possess this level of personal wealth.

#### Dragon-Blooded
The typical Dynastic stipend is represented by Resources 3, with more successful or prominent Dynasts having Resources 4-5. If a Dynast has Resources 0-2, it might represent her being disfavored by her house or coming from an impoverished household, or might be the result of her falling into debt, making unwise investments, or living far beyond her means.

#### Sidereal
The typical starting salary is three-dot Resources; Sidereals can expect a quick promotion to four dots after a few successful missions. Lower ratings reflect sizable debts, disciplinary pay cuts, assets seizures incidental to auditing, poor money management, etc.

# The Resources System

Real prices are tremendously variable based upon supply, demand, politics, and haggling. As such, each item is assigned a Resources value. The number given indicates the rating necessary for a character to view a purchase as a significant but not ruinous expense—higher-rating characters can often absorb lower-rated Resources expenditure with ease.

Things usually purchased immediately or which must be repurchased frequently (animal fodder, drugs, fancy clothing) count against monthly income, while infrequent purchases are compared to expected income for a year (military field commands, large caravans, slaves) or even a decade (ships, villas, palaces, jewelry), as folks often take loans or mortgages to afford large buys. As such, a purchase’s Resource value is not a hard cap on affordability— use the actual prices and discretion to determine what’s affordable.

In the world of Exalted, loans, credit, and debt are standard, from bar tabs, to tax loans from landlords, to Guild factors backing merchants, to military commissions paid for by wealthy relatives. Characters who frequently make purchases at their level of Resources are almost always in debt. Debt doesn’t necessarily reduce Resources, but it does create plot complications—consider handling it as a custom Flaw (p. 167). 

The Resources Merit needn’t pay for all a starting character’s mundane equipment—a destitute former soldier may retain her arms and armor, while a pair of smugglers might have won their ship in a bet. Characters begin play with whatever possessions are appropriate for their concepts, within reason.

## Cost of Living 

Most people spend their money maintaining their lives. An urban laborer gambles to stay in favor with a local gang. A merchant pays tariffs and bribes, while a businesswoman dines with partners and pays the wages of assistants and employees. The upper classes decorate their mansions, feed and clothe their slaves and servants, pay guards and thugs, throw galas, patronize the arts, indulge in vices, and finance the business excursions and expenses of younger family members and other hangers-on. 

As a general rule, any character who spends less than half her income on the cost of living is in danger of being judged by her peers as eccentric, stingy, or unworthy of her station. This may lead to social snubs, disintegrating business deals, or attempts on her fortune, livelihood, or even life from contemporaries who begin to view her as an outsider
