*Even in a doomed world, the Abyssal’s genius will endure until the moment of the end.*
Upon learning this Charm, the Abyssal rolls ([[Intelligence]] + highest [[Craft]]) with a free full [[Abyssal Excellency|Excellency]]. She gains silver points equal to her successes, and a gold point for each 10.
At the end of each story in which the Abyssal actively used [[Craft]], she repeats this roll.
