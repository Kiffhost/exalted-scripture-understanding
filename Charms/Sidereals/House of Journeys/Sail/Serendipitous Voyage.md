The Sidereal’s eyes glint yellow as she looks away from the present, tracing her route backward from its destination. The Sidereal rolls ([Intelligence, [[Perception]], or Wits] + [[Sail]]) to introduce the fact that there’s a vessel at a nearby port or other vehicle that’s willing to take her aboard and that will, if even remotely possible, reach a destination of her choice, though its captain and crew may not yet know it. The roll’s difficulty depends on how far-flung the chosen destination is, the number of nearby ships or vehicles present in the Sidereal’s present locale, and any factors that might complicate her securing passage aboard a ship. If she chooses a destination that isn’t accessible by her the introduced vehicle (like an inland city if she travels by boat), she’ll instead arrive at the location that’s the furthest that vehicle can travel toward the chosen destination. As long as the Sidereal travels aboard it, the vessel is assured to eventually arrive at least in the vicinity of the chosen destination unless dramatic events render this completely impossible. However, there’s no guarantee the voyage will be safe, speedy, or cheap. If Lintha pirates set fire to a ship, it may be that only the vessel’s wreckage will eventually wash up at the chosen destination’s shores.
