*The universe trembles as the Infernal and her unwoven coadjutor undergo a shared apotheosis, becoming oversoul and emanation.*

The Infernal’s unwoven coadjutor becomes her fetich soul, expressing an aspect of her personality or identity chosen by her player. Her new fetich changes even further, sloughing off almost all traces of its past demonic nature to become an embodiment of the Infernal’s self.

The Infernal gains a Defining Principle that expresses the chosen facet of herself. It can’t be weakened or altered by any means, not even voluntarily. Her fetich soul’s personality may shift or change to better express this Intimacy, but it doesn’t “gain” that Intimacy directly. If she already has a suitable Defining Principle, she can express it through her fetich instead.

The Infernal is no longer limited to using [[Swallowing the Scorpion]] once per scene, gaining all of its benefits permanently. She waives [[Sun-Heart Furnace Soul|Sun-Heart Furnace Soul's]] cost.
