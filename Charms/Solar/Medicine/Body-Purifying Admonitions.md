*The Solar can draw the most vicious and noxious of poisons from her victim’s body—even those that are supernatural in nature.*
Roll the Exalt’s ([[Wits]] + [[Medicine]]) against the toxin’s duration. If the Solar fully succeeds in lowering the duration, venoms and intoxicants seep from their point of entry, while poisons boil to the surface wherever the Solar touches her patient. This Charm does not completely remove all traces from a target’s system—the Exalt may still need to treat residual effects, and the patient may experience one final attack to his health levels. But it does ensure that the toxin fully leaves the body after its next interval. If the Solar strikes a supernatural poison from her target’s body in one attempt, she gains a point of [[Willpower]].
