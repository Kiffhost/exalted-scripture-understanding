*The Lunar adopts the bearing of predator or prey at her leisure.*
While using this Charm, she may freely shift between these two postures: 
**Predator**: Characters perceive the Lunar as their natural predator â€” she seems an auditor to a corrupt bureaucrat, or a bandit to a humble farmer. 
**Prey**: The Lunar presents herself as timid, vulnerable, and valuable. Anyone unfamiliar with her perceives her as an easy mark until she proves otherwise. 
Regardless of the option chosen, the Lunar can leverage its impact as though it were a Minor [[Intimacy]].
