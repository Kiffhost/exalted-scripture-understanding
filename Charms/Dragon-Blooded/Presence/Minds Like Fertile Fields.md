The Dragon-Blood speaks an aphorism weighted with Earth Essence, suffusing her listener with receptive passivity. She rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence) against the Resolve of a single character. A successful roll induces a pleasant trance state that lasts a few seconds. If anyone immediately follows this up with an influence roll targetingtheentrancedcharacter,hisreceptivestateleaves him unable to call on Intimacies to bolster his Resolve, nor can his Intimacies be exploited to lower his Resolve.
