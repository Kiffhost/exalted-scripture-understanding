*The Lawgiver speaks out against injustice, and a spirit of divine wrath falls over her audience.*
The Exalt harangues a crowd for at least ten minutes, exposing an injustice that has been done—typically playing on those specific principles of faith, tradition, or morality that are popular with her audience. This acts as a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Performance]]) inspire action against the average [[Resolve]] of the crowd. If successful, the speech ignites anger at a specific cause, but leaves the mob as a disorganized, riotous mass. However, for every three extra successes on the roll, the Solar’s player can direct the mob at a single target linked to the crowd’s anger. For example, with nine extra successes, the Solar could lead a mob in Nexus to attack the [[Guild]] Hall, set fire to the docks as a distraction, and free the slaves on auction row.
