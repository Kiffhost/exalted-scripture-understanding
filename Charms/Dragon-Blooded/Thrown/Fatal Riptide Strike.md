*The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s anima limns her hands and weaponry with aqueous [[Essence]], allowing them to move through water as though it were air.*
She ignores penalties for throwing a weapon from or through water or similar liquids. Surprise attacks she makes while underwater deal ([[Essence]]) additional dice of damage. Once per scene, when the Dragon-Blood makes an unexpected attack against an enemy with lower [[Initiative]] while underwater, she may pay one [[Willpower]] and expend her Water Aura to convert it to an ambush (Exalted, p. 203).
