Through skill and resolve, the Solar conquers the darkest dominions of the sea. This Charm starts an ongoing dramatic action in which the Solar navigates a ship through a hazard such as a coral reef, the living sargassum around Bluehaven, the hidden rocks in a storm-tossed bay, and so on. The Exalt gains two bonus dice to navigate dangerous features she’s unfamiliar with, or two automatic successes toclearahazardshe’snavigatedflawlesslyinthepast.Flawlesslymeanswithouttakinghulldamageandwithoutusing Charms or other magic to negate hull damage. Bonuses fromthisCharmareappliedtoeachrolltoevadethehazard. These bonuses do not count as dice added by a Charm.
