When the ifrit courts beyond the borders of Dazra Province rejected Daimyo Sirisun’s authority, he commissioned the Old Zephyrite artificer Open Hand to forge a weapon that would demonstrate his power over such earthly spirits. Using a coruscating crimson dragonscale unearthed from a vault deep beneath Chiaroscuro — marked as having come from the Elemental Dragon itself — and the finest red jade, Open Hand forged a weapon of such incendiary might that even fire elementals would wither in its flames. Sirisun sent forth his champion, Keiken Mai, to conquer the ifrits. She performed her task swiftly and skillfully, but while the ifrit princes bowed down to the daimyo, Mai was sickened at slaying immortals to feed an old man’s pride. When further abuses inflamed the lesser lords of Dazra, she stoked the fires of rebellion. Marching at the head of the rebel soldiers, Mai burned Sirisun alive in his palace — Fire Aspect though he was — and set a young, idealistic Dragon-Blooded officer in his place. Afterward, she gifted Sekhem to the ifrit princes as a gesture of contrition. Sekhem is a dragon sigh wand of red jade with orichalcum fittings. A draconic carving winds along the barrel, its mouth the muzzle, its long sharp tongue a thrusting blade that serves as a bayonet. The weapon is hot enough to sear flesh and char wood, burning those who grasp it as per Smoldering Steel Ignition (p. 64). An accompanying pair of red jade gauntlets protects against this heat. Attuning to Sekhem attunes the gauntlets at no cost. 
 
## Evocations of Sekhem

Sekhem’s flames burn hotter than firedust ought — too hot even for red jade to easily contain. This is measured by its Heat rating. It begins at zero, rising by one each time Sekhem is fired, to a maximum of 10. Its Heat falls by one at the end of a round in which the wielder did not fire Sekhem, and resets to zero at the end of the scene. Withering attacks add (Heat) to raw damage. This includes bayonet attacks; fire rolls out along the blade, turning it white-hot. At the start of the Exalt’s turn, roll (Heat − Essence) dice, minimum 0. If any die comes up a 1, Sekhem’s barrel cracks. While the barrel is cracked, the Exalt’s attacks suffer a two-die penalty on attack and damage rolls; Heat doesn’t increase; and the weapon’s Evocations cannot be activated. Repairing the barrel is a major project (Exalted, p. 242) requiring Craft (Artifact) that takes a few hours, but cannot be accelerated with Craftsman Needs No Tools or similar magic. The Heat keyword indicates the minimum Heat required to activate an Evocation.
