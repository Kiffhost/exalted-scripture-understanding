*The sorcerer traces out a palindromic poem in a long-forgotten language in shimmering, reflective letters, creating a mirror to all hostility that spins above her head.*

Whenever an enemy makes a decisive attack, his reflection emerges from the mirror-poem to make a counterattack. It has the same dice pool as the original attack, including bonuses and penalties, and benefits from any magic that enhanced the original attack. It likewise uses the attacker’s Initiative for the counterattack’s damage, rather than the sorcerer’s, and doesn’t reset the sorcerer’s Initiative. Any other effects conveyed by the attack likewise use the attacker’s traits at the time he made the attack. If necessary, the Storyteller may alter an effect if the attacker would be an invalid target or the effect would be otherwise inapplicable, but this can’t bypass defensive effects or immunities.

The reflection fades once the counterattack is made. This ends any effects that require the attacker’s continuing presence, such as a grappling — on a successful grapple, the reflection can only throw or slam the attacker before disappearing.

Enemies can end this spell prematurely by attacking the conjured mirror. It has Defense 4, Hardness 6, and twenty −0 health levels. However, attacks against it provoke reflected counterattacks just like attacking the sorcerer.
# Control
The sorcerer’s fingertip drips with silvery, reflecting ink. She can cover surfaces with it as swiftly as she can brush her hand over them, creating impromptu mirrors. She can pay five motes to have a reflection clash a decisive attack against her instead of making a counterattack.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 20)
The distorting sorcerer wrests away control of the mirror, though he must hold it in his hands, rather than letting it float above him. If he makes an attack (not counting the mirror’s counterattacks), takes a Shape Sorcery action, or takes a similar harmful action, he loses his grip on the mirror, which returns to the caster.
