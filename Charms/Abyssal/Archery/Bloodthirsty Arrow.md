*The Abyssal’s arrow twists through the air in search of her prey.*
The Abyssal reduces an enemy’s [[Defense]] bonus from [[cover]] by one, or inflicts −1 [[Defense]] on an enemy without [[cover]].
If the attack benefits from [[Aim|aiming]], it can strike enemies behind [[Cover#Full|full cover]], passing directly through the obstruction as long as there’s some opening for the attack to pass through. However, such enemies still receive +3 non-Charm [[Defense]] from the cover.
