The first Evocation of the [[Brilliant Sentinel]] draws the light of the wearer’s anima into the heart of the armor to feed its strength. This Evocation only functions if the Exalt’s anima is flaring at the glowing level or higher. For each mote the Exalt spends, she vents one display level of her anima into the armor, dimming her display by that much. The armor can hold up to three levels of anima flare, and when it is filled to its maximum capacity, it glows visibly, inflicting a -3 penalty to stealth attempts. Each level of anima flare contained within the armor negates one die of decisive damage rolled against its wearer. At any time, the Exalt may reflexively end [[Luminous Soul Warden]], emptying the armor of all anima flare and reinstating her anima at a level equal to the number of display levels that were contained in the armor. 

## Special activation rules

Rather than being bought with experience, [[Luminous Soul Warden]] is active the moment the breastplate is first attuned. In addition, once per scene, if she has a Solar-aspected hearthstone placed in the armor’s gorget, she may pay one mote to fill the armor with one charge of anima even if her own is still dim.
