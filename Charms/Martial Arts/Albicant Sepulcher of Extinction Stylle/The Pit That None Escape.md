*The bleak saint knows all things fall towards nonexistence. She merely hastens that drop.*
The stylist emanates a vortex of all-devouring [[Essence]], extending out to medium range. Within this vortex, enemies face the following effects:
 - The vortex devours light, inflicting a −3 penalty on rolls when the lack of visibility disadvantages someone. The radiance of anima banners and similar magical displays can shine through the dark, but characters treat their anima as one step lower to determine its visibility (Exalted, p. XX).
 - At the start of each of her turns, they must roll ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) roll at a difficulty of her ([[Essence]]). On a failed roll, they’re knocked prone and dragged one range band toward her.
 - Any [[movement]] away from the stylist counts as [[difficult terrain]] (Exalted, p. 199).
 - When an enemy within the vortex spends 10+ motes on an attack against the stylist, she gains one mote.
 - The stylist gains any [[Initiative]] sapped from them by [[Let Every Chain Be Broken]] The stylist must pay one [[Initiative]] at the start of each subsequent turn to maintain this Charm. It ends if the stylist takes a [[movement]] action or is forcibly moved or knocked prone.
## Special activation rules
The stylist can use this Charm reflexively when she enters this style’s Form.
