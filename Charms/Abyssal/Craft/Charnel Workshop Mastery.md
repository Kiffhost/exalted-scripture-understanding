*No scrap of carrion or splinter of bone is beneath the Abyssal artisan’s notice, imbuing her work with deathly power.*
The Abyssal excels in making use of the dead as raw materials: forging armor from iron mixed with bonecoal, tanning hides for a cloak, tempering a daiklave by executing a prisoner. So long as such materials form an essential component of a project, she only needs two extra successes to trigger an increased Craft reward on basic and major projects (Exalted, pp. 240–241).
Additionally, when the Abyssal uses a nontrivial character’s remains for a major project, the cost for her first roll is reduced by (victim’s Essence, maximum 5) silver points. If she killed him herself, it’s reduced by (applicable Craft) points, if that’s higher.
With Craft 5, Essence 3, the Abyssal can enhance superior projects using remains from supernatural beings.
She reduces the first roll’s gold point cost by (victim’s Essence/2, rounded up) or (his Essence) if she killed him herself. Soulsteel artifacts always receive this benefit, treating soulforged ghosts as Essence 1 unless they’ve already been established as characters.
