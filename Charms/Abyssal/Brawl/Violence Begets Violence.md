*Every move made against the deathknight is a step toward one’s own grave.*
After an enemy deals enough damage with a withering attack to reduce the Abyssal’s [[Initiative]] below his, she can use this Charm to make a withering counterattack. She doesn’t gain [[Initiative]] from its damage roll.
Alternatively, the deathknight can defend against grapples, using this Charm after an enemy’s control roll.
His 1s subtract successes. If the Abyssal beats his roll, she takes control of the grapple rather than merely escaping it.
With an [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses this Charm to make a counterattack, letting her gain [[Initiative]] normally from the damage roll.
## Reset 
Once per round unless reset by recovering from [[Initiative]] Crash
