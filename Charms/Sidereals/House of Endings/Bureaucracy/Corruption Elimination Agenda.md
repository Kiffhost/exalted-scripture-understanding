The Sidereal’s exhortations of diligence give even the most corrupt functionaries reason to reconsider their ways. The Sidereal addresses an organization’s members, circulates a memorandum, or otherwise disseminates a message that corruption will not be tolerated. Organization members who receive this message may treat the agenda as a Defining Principle opposing corruption when its advantageous to them, though it can’t be used against them. They aren’t forced to obey it, but lose this benefit if they engage in corruption.
