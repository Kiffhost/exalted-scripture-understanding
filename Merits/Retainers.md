This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
Each purchase grants the character a single Storyteller-controlled servant, an expert in their field with noteworthy and useful abilities. The nature of this servant must be defined at the time the Merit is purchased. They might be a courtesan, bodyguard, assassin, advisor, or even high priest of the character. [[Retainers]] are outstanding experts in their profession (four or five dot Ability ratings plus at least one applicable specialty), and are personally loyal to the character (or at least strongly motivated not to betray or abandon him).
Two dots grants a mortal or minor supernatural ally (such as a God-Blooded assassin or demonic advisor of the First Circle), who may possess useful contacts or experience, political clout, martial prowess, or other resources he is willing to lay on the line at the character’s bidding.
Four dots grants a supernatural ally at least as powerful as a young Terrestrial Exalt, though always weaker than the character himself—peers are best represented as [[Allies]] rather than [[Retainers]].

#### Lunar
Many Lunars retain the services of Moon-Touched, which are two-dot [[Retainers]].

#### Sidereals
Minor spirits, commonly employed by Sidereals as secretaries, bodyguards, couriers, etc., are two-dot [[Retainers]]. Young Heaven’s Dragons (Sidereal, p. XX) are often employed in similar capacities as four-dot [[Retainers]].
