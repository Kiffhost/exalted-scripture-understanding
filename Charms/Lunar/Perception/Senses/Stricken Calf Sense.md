She rerolls 5s and 6s until they cease to appear on a diagnosis roll, and completes it instantly. Alternatively, this Charm can supplement a roll to detect a concealed character or a tracking roll. If the opposing character suffers from an ailment the Lunar has previously diagnosed, she adds a non-Charm success.
