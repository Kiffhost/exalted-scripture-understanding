Nightbane pierces the soul, banishing dark passions and maddening afflictions. The wielder makes a gambit against a character with an appropriate Intimacy — either a negative Tie, or a Principle contrary to one of her own — of which she’s aware, rolling (Dexterity + [lower of Archery or Presence]) against his Resolve, boosted by that Intimacy. Characters can’t choose not to apply Resolve, although they may opt to use Defense instead if it’s higher. The gambit’s difficulty is (Intimacy + 1). If successful, the Intimacy is fully eroded. The target may spend one Willpower to instead have the Intimacy only weakened one step. Outside combat, this Evocation can be used without an Initiative roll. 

## Resonant

With Essence 3, this gambit can target Derangements. This functions as above, except that success temporarily lowers the Derangement’s intensity by one step for the story (suppressing Minor Derangements altogether).
