*Upon learning this technique, the Solar’s senses guard her from threats she is not consciously aware of.*
Whenever the Solar is in danger—even if she is not consciously aware of the threat—her relevant senses will home in on the source of danger, enhancing her [[Awareness]] to make the threat known to her. [[Surprise Anticipation Method]] has two functions.
First: for every 9 she rolls on an [[Awareness]] check to reveal a hidden enemy, trap, or any source of harm not readily apparent, she gains a single mote of [[Essence]], and for every 10 she gains two. This charge of [[Essence]] can only be used to offset the cost of activating [[Awareness]] [[Charms]] to reveal a threat. Motes returned in this fashion may retroactively lower the cost committed to [[Awareness]] [[Charms]] of a scene or longer duration, both lowering the committed cost and returning the discounted mote(s) to the Solar’s mote pool.
Second: her senses function even when she is asleep or Incapacitated, allowing her to use any of her [[Awareness]] [[Charms]] subconsciously. A threat revealed to the Solar while she is asleep or unconscious automatically revives her, allowing her to defend herself.
## Sidebar
That’s not a typo. This is a Reflexive Charm with no cost. [[Surprise Anticipation Method]] represents a Solar who has honed her senses to a near psychic degree. They act on her behalf to reveal threats to her. Remember, though, [[Charms]] are not actors—it is simply easier to communicate the idea to the player in terms of what a Charm does. In reality, [[Charms]] only represent the naturally enhanced proclivities of the character in question, pre-existing, validated by the player’s investment of experience points.
