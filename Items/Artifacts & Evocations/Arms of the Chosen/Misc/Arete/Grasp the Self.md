*The Exalt clenches her orichalcum hand into a fist, the feel of cold metal reminding her of who she is and the sacrifices she’s made to fulfill her potential.*
When the Exalt enters a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], if the social influence action was supported by a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that’s focused on someone or something other than herself, she may reject the influence by abandoning that [[Intimacy]] instead of calling on another one to oppose it; she is who she is, and other attachments mean nothing to her in light of this truth. She must still pay the [[Willpower]] cost to resist. This Evocation may be used once per story, but may be reset by raising an [[Intimacy]] tied to something outside oneself to Major. 

## Resonant

This Evocation waives the [[Willpower]] cost of resisting in a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]].
