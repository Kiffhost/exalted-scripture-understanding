*Though destiny may demand a life be cut short, the Sidereal may grant the dead the solace of seeing their final wishes fulfilled.*
When the Sidereal uses Obituary Composition Technique to discover a dead person’s unfinished business, she may take it on in their stead, committing the Charm’s cost indefinitely. She gains the following benefits
- She gains all of the deceased’s Intimacies relevant to his unfinished business. They can’t be weakened below Minor. Once per day, when she upholds such an Intimacy at Major or Defining intensity, she gains an additional Willpower.
- She gains all of the deceased’s memories that are relevant to his unfinished business. The Storyteller should reveal specific memories as they become important. The Sidereal may use them as a Lore background to introduce facts.
- When she makes a roll with any Ability that involves the unfinished business, she waives the mote cost to lower its target number with an Excellency. This doesn’t apply to rolls made in combat.
- Whenever the Sidereal has an opportunity to make progress on the unfinished business, the Storyteller should tell her player this fact, though not what the opportunity actually is. Likewise, when she encounters someone relevant to the unfinished business, she learns that, but not how they’re relevant.
This Charm ends when the Sidereal completes the unfinished business or it becomes impossible for her to do so; she can’t end it prematurely. She loses all Intimacies and memories conferred by it.
If the Sidereal was successful, this counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. 132). She may also summon the deceased’s ghost to seek repayment, as though binding a demon (Exalted, p. 473), without needing to roll. Alternatively, she may send him unto Lethe — with Rising Butterfly Prayer’s benefits if she knows it. Especially powerful ghosts may require a roll to affect, though their unfinished business should be the main challenge in dealing with them.
If the Sidereal fails to accomplish he deceased’s unfinished business, she rolls (current temporary Willpower) dice, losing one Willpower for each failed die and one Limit for each 10.
