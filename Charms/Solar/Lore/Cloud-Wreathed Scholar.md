*The Solar is a bottomless font of knowledge, renewed by any source of true intrigue.*
While pursuing the goals of her Circle or the goals of someone for whom she holds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]], the Solar may use this Charm to roll to [[Introducing a Fact|introduce a fact]], even if she has already introduced a fact that scene. The Solar may only use this Charm when she perceives a need for her expertise, and only if it pertains to the events at hand.

### On [[Cloud-Wreathed Scholar]]

When I wrote the [[Lore]] rules, I limited players to one introduced fact per scene. I was wary of clogging one scene with too many lore-based revelations. But I think this Charm is significantly limited enough to prevent such abuse, while allowing the Solar savant to tackle a continuous flow of puzzles, riddles, and historical mysteries to aid her allies in advancement.
