Everlasting Descent’s gravity drags an enemy across the battlefield. The wielder makes a difficulty 3 unblockable (Intelligence + Martial Arts) gambit against an enemy within medium range, adding (Spin) dice on the attack roll. Success pulls her target into close range with her and steals (Spin) Initiative from him. If Whirling Ecliptic Barrier is active, the wielder gains that Initiative. Alternatively, the wielder can use this Evocation when an enemy within long range suffers forced movement, changing his trajectory so that he moves toward her. This doesn’t require a gambit. 

## Resonant

If this brings an Evocation within close range of the wielder, she may reflexively make a decisive attack against him. 

## Dissonant

The gambit’s range is short, but increases to medium with Spin 3+.
