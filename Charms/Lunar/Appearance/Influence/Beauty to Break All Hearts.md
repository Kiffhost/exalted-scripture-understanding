The Lunar embodies a divine cynosure, ever-present in the hearts of those that love and desire her. Characters with Major or Defining Ties of love, lust, etc., toward her suffer –1 [[Resolve]] against her instill, persuade, bargain, and inspire rolls with any Attribute (including written influence), and must pay an additional [[Willpower]] to resist them. This also applies when such Ties lower their [[Resolve]] against seduction-based [[Charms]] that compare the Lunar’s [[Appearance]] to their [[Resolve]]. Such characters suffer a –([[Intimacy]]) penalty on rolls opposing the Lunar or a known ally of hers if they believe the Lunar would disapprove of their action. They can’t attack or otherwise harm the Lunar or her allies at all unless they enter a Decision Point and spend one [[Willpower]] to do so for one scene. Affected characters can’t voluntarily erode such Ties unless they encounter evidence that the Lunar has directly harmed them or one of their Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. [[Influence]] rolls to weaken these Ties fail automatically unless supported by such evidence. Protean: In a human shape that a character has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of love, lust, etc., toward, the Lunar applies this Charm’s effects against that character while he can see her.
