The Lunar shifts her anatomy to withstand even the deadliest venoms. She rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on a roll to resist poison (Exalted, p. 233). If it’s a poison she’s previously been exposed to, or the poison of an animal species whose form she’s claimed, she rerolls 5s until they cease to appear as well. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is venomous or poisonous may learn this as a Wits Charm.
