*Bloodying her fists against countless foes, the Abyssal feasts on crimson bounty.*
When the Abyssal deals damage with a decisive attack, she steals (enemy’s wound penalty + 1) motes after damage has been applied, maximum ([[Dexterity]], [[Stamina]], or [[Strength]]). If she incapacitates her victim, she steals (his [[Essence]] + 3) additional motes, which don’t count toward this limit.
Against grappled enemies, the Abyssal can use this Charm to make a savaging attack by baring fangs and drinking their blood. She deals lethal damage, and can steal motes equal to her rounds of grapple control if that’s higher.
