*Foreseeing her enemy’s attacks, the Sidereal arranges to be elsewhere when they land.*
The Sidereal ignores (higher of Essence or 3) points of Evasion penalty. If her attacker has a positive Tie to her, she ignores all Evasion penalties. This can’t negate penalties from surprise attacks.
If the Sidereal is unarmored or if she has no Evasion penalties to negate, she can dodge an attack whose successes equal her Evasion.
