*The deathknight wields her weapon like an artist’s brush, painting the battlefield crimson with every strike.*
The Abyssal strikes a direful blow against a crashed enemy. On a withering attack, each attack roll extra success converts one die of damage to an automatic success. On a decisive attack, each extra success rerolls a failed die on the damage roll, starting with 6s and moving down.
