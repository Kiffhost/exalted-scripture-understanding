For each extra success on a decisive attack roll, she converts one die of raw damage to an automatic successes, up to a maximum of (Essence) dice. Unexpected attacks have no upper limit on how many damage dice can be converted to successes. An enemy killed with this Charm dissolves into smoke, leaving behind no corpse.
