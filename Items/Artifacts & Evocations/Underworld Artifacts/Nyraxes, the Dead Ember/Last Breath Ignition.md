*A spark from the last breath of the dying tinges Nyraxes’ flame.*
When someone dies within long range of the lantern-bearer, she captures one of his Major or Defining Intimacies within its flame. If she’s aware of such an [[Intimacy]], she may choose to capture it; otherwise, the [[Storyteller]] picks. She can draw on the captured [[Intimacy]] as if she possessed it, letting her bolster [[Resolve]], cite it in [[Decision Points]], or use it for any other purpose. Each time she does, she gains that [[Intimacy]] at Minor intensity, or strengthens it by one step if she already has it, up to a maximum of the captured Intimacy’s intensity.
If the deceased lingers as a ghost, he loses the captured [[Intimacy]] and can’t regain it by any means for this Evocation’s duration. However, the lantern-bearer’s influence can still leverage it against him.
