*Her senses fully attuned to the web of living [[Essence]] that surrounds her, the Immaculate foretells the approach of impending death.*
She gains the benefits of a [[full defense]] (Exalted, p. 196) to block attacks from enemies marked with her [[Soul-Marking Style]], and ignores the [[Defense]] penalty from their surprise attacks. If the Immaculate is ambushed by a marked foe, she may pay one [[Willpower]] to block the attack. Her [[Defense|Parry]] is limited to (her Essence/2, rounded up), and cannot be raised higher or benefit from other [[Charms]].
