*The Infernal rips arms from their sockets and gleefully gouges out eyes, a sadistic lessons for would-be heroes.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after the damage roll of a decisive savaging attack. If her victim doesn’t accept the highest level of crippling injury possible (Exalted, p. 201), the Infernal gains one round of grapple control for each extra successes on the attack roll. She then rolls additional dice of decisive damage equal to her new total rounds of control.

If the enemy takes a crippling injury, it doesn’t count against his once-per-story limit on doing so, and he’s immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene.

This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived against trivial opponents. The Infernal’s player can choose what crippling injuries they suffer instead of the Storyteller.
