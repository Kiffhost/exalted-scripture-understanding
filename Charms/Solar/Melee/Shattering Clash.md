*The Solar’s interdicting strike lays waste to her opponent.*
Upon a successful decisive attack, but before damage is rolled, the Lawgiver channels the fury of her [[Essence]] through the strike. If the attack does at least six health levels of damage to the target, three of that damage can be traded to destroy the target’s weapon, provided that weapon is made of natural (non-magical) materials such as steel.

### On [[Shattering Clash]]

This Charm is risky because of the cost and the fact that you have to throw it before you see the damage roll. Because 10s are not doubled on the damage roll of a decisive attack you want to use this Charm with 14+ [[Initiative]] for the best chance to do the required damage.
