The Dragon-Blood embodies the relentless nature of earth in her persistent argument, shaking the convictions of even her strongest-willed rivals. After failing a persuade roll, she may reset her attempt (Exalted, p. 222), allowing her to try again. If her target uses the same Intimacy to bolster his Resolve that he did against the original attempt, the bonus it provides is lowered by one. Grinding Millstone Argument can only be used once per scene.
