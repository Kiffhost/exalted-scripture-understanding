*Sworn to the world’s destruction, the Abyssal hastens its final day with her dark creations.*
The Abyssal gains additional craft points for fulfilling [[Crafting Projects#Basic Objectives|basic objectives]] (Exalted, p. 240) in certain ways, adding “advanced” objectives to them:
 - If her project causes another character to gain or strengthen a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her, she gains extra points if it’s a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] or a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] of awe, desire, or obsession.
 - If she gains something beneficial from completing the project, she gains extra craft points, she gains extra points if that reward will aid her in serving death’s chivalry.
 - If the project supports one of her Intimacies, she gains extra points if that [[Intimacy]] is a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]], a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] to one of the dead, or a [[Intimacy|Principle]] involving death.
Each advanced objective the Abyssal fulfills grants two silver points for a basic project or one gold point for others, in addition to a project’s usual rewards.
This Charm is compatible with effects like [[Entropic Crucible Understanding]] that let the Abyssal receive project awards from non-[[Craft]] actions.
