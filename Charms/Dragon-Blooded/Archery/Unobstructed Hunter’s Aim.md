Sighting along the flow of living Essence, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a flawless shot. She may add bonus dice to an Archery roll for one mote each. As long as she attacks a living target — or an undead one, which stands out as a void in the Essence of the world — each added die negates one point of penalty from visual obstruction such as poor lighting or smoke.
