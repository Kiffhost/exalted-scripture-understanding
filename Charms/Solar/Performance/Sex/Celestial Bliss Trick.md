The Exalt performs the body-mudra of sighs and whispers upon a lover, unleashing a torrent of unimaginable ecstasy. This intense lovemaking lasts at least three minutes, inducing a world-shaking climax in her partner. In the afterglow, the Exalt becomes the object of a temporary Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of lust that lasts for ([[Essence]]) weeks, and gains ([[Essence]]) automatic successes to social influence actions targeting her lover for the rest of the scene.
