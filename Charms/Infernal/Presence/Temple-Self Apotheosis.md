*The Infernal exults in the worship of her faithful, empowered to answer their prayers for a new and better world made in her image.*

The Infernal gains additional benefits from the Cult Merit (Exalted, p. 160):
- She can draw on her Cult an additional time each story.
- She can draw on her Cult to reduce a mote cost by (Essence + Cult), rather than reducing a Willpower cost.
- Once per day, she can draw on her Cult to heal a level of non-aggravated damage, rather than reducing a Willpower cost.
- When she makes an influence roll that’s supported by her target’s Tie of reverence toward her, she adds an automatic success. If the influence targets multiple characters, all of them must have such a Tie.
