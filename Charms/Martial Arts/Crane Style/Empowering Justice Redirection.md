Crane stylists do not initiate hostilitiesâ€”they end them. Empowering Justice Redirection can supplement any attack against an enemy who has attacked the martial artist or a character she is protecting with a defend other action during the current or previous round. It adds one success to the attack roll, and one die to the post-soak damage of the attack. This increases to two successes and two post-soak dice of damage if the provoking attack successfully landed. 

## Mastery

The dice of damage added by this Charm are converted to automatic successes.
