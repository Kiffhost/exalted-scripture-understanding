Once per day, the sorcerer can mumble and babble for several minutes until she catches a word of power. She rolls (Wits + Occult) to hold it inside her, gaining sorcerous motes equal to her successes. These sorcerous motes last until the end of the day, or until she speaks anything other than a spell’s incantation.
