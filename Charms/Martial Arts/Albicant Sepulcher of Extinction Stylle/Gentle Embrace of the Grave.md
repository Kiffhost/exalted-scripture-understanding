*All things yield to their end.*
The stylist makes a decisive attack against an enemy as long as he meets at least one of the following conditions:
 - He has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that reflects a positive outlook on death.
 - He has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that reflects a motive to cause harm or death.
 - He has no Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that give him a reason to continue living or existing.
 - He suffers from despair caused by an [[inspire]] roll, or has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] based on despair.
 - He has an Obsession inflicted by [[Rejoice! The Abattoir Awaits]], or another [[Derangement]] related to mortality or death.
The attack succeeds if it beats either the targetâ€™s [[Defense]] or his [[Resolve]], and adds attack roll automatic successes as dice of damage. She doubles the amount of damage dice added if at least two conditions are met, or triples them if three or more are met.
If an enemy is incapacitated by this attack, a tomb of spectral [[Essence]] forms around his corpse. His soul withers and decays into nothingness within, which permanently destroys spirits.
