*A pale azure limns pages writ in the Infernal’s hand, forbidding the unworthy from reading her works.*

When the Infernal writes a text meant for certain recipients, she forbids all others from reading it. Other characters can’t bring themselves to read the text and willfully refuse to understand if they’re forced to read or hear it read aloud.

A character whose Resolve equals or exceeds the Infernal’s (Essence + Linguistics) can pay two Willpower to resist this, or one Willpower if he has a relevant Defining Intimacy. The Infernal senses when such a transgression occurs and treats it as a violation of Hell’s laws for other Infernal Charms. Mortals and First Circle demons can’t resist.
