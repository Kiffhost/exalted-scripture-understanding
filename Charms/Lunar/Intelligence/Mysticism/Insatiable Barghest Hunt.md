The Lunar devours the dead, drinking the blood of hearts that long since stopped beating.
The Lunar may perform sacred hunts on ghosts of humans and animals, taking the shape that the ghost had in life. She need not permanently destroy a ghost if she takes its heart’s blood by lethally incapacitating it.
The Lunar can use Memory-Drinking Meditation (Lunars, p. 197) to access a broad category of memories from the ghost’s living existence — romance, his home city, the events of the last year of his life — without needing to take an Intimacy. If she has that Charm’s repurchase, she can gain all of a ghost’s memories from life without taking one of their Intimacies.
The Lunar can use God-Body Consumption (Lunars, p. 250) to take a ghost’s Eclipse Charms along with its shape.
