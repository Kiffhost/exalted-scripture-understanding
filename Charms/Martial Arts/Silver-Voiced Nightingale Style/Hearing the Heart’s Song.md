Honing her senses, the Nightingale hears the music of her foe’s heart, catching a strain of melody that betrays his intent to attack. Hearing the Heart’s Song adds (the martial artist’s Performance/2, round up) to her Evasion against a decisive attack. If she successfully defends against the attack, she gleans insights into her enemy’s heart, making a reflexive read intentions action against his Guile and adding her (boosted) Evasion in non-Charm bonus dice. 

## Mastery

Successfully reading an enemy’s intentions with this Charm allows the martial artist to steal one point of Initiative from him for each extra success on her roll.
