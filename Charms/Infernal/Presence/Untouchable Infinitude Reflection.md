*The Infernal’s contemplation of the countless prayers made unto her affords her a greater understanding of the nature of worship.*

The Infernal invokes her Cult without it counting against the limit on how many times she can use it per story. This Charm can’t be used in combat.
## Reset
Once per day, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Tie to the Infernal’s worshippers. With Essence 3, this becomes once per scene.
