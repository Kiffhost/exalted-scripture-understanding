*The sorcerer’s hands crackle with sickly green [[Essence]] as she rips away her victim’s face, leaving only a blank mask in its place.* 

The sorcerer exchanges someone’s face with a mask, requiring an ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll against his ([[Appearance]] + {Integrity or Resistance}) roll. In combat, this requires a difficulty 4 unarmed gambit, with success letting the sorcerer roll as above. The sorcerer must prepare the mask beforehand; doing so requires at least a basic project with an appropriate [[Craft]] (Exalted, p. 240). 

Success strips away both the victim’s face and his identity: even his closest friends can’t recognize him without a difficulty 7 ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Socialize}) roll to identify him. Characters without a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the victim fail automatically unless they enhance the roll with magic or benefit from other circumstances, like knowledge of one of the victim’s distinguishing features. 

The victim can still see, speak, eat, and the like with the mask that is now his face, but its voice is dull and monotone and any sensations felt through it are muted. He suffers a –3 penalty on spoken influence rolls and on [[Perception]] rolls. He also subtracts –3 from his effective [[Appearance]] when determining how many dice it adds on influence rolls. 

The victim’s stolen face can be worn as a mask. This requires no roll, but is treated as a disguise roll to impersonate the curse’s victim. Body type, ethnicity, and gender are no obstacle, though extreme differences may render the disguise ineffective — a Lunar can’t impersonate a human in tyrant lizard form. Rolls against the disguise are difficulty 7 and use the same rules for characters without Ties as the roll for recognizing the victim. 

An affixed face can’t normally be removed from a wearer, but the spell’s victim can reclaim their visage. Outside of combat, this typically requires a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Larceny]]) roll opposing a ([[Wits]] + [[Larceny]]) roll. In combat, it’s treated as an unarmed disarm gambit. 

If the victim retrieves his face, he can exchange it with his cursed mask, freeing him from the curse. If the spell is instead broken by magic that can undo Shaping effects or sorcerous curses, the stolen face vanishes as the cursed mask transforms back into it. 
# Control
The sorcerer can freely remove her own face, as above, without needing to cast this spell. She doesn’t suffer the penalty on influence rolls or sensory rolls. 
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
Distortion restores a semblance of the victim’s original semblance to the mask, freeing him from this spell’s effects for one scene.
