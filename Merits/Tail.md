The character has a tail, which might be scaly, furred, tufted, or fleshy like a rat. For one dot, the tail adds two dice to attempts to maintain balance. For two dots, the tail is also prehensile, and may act as a fully functional limb, although it suffers a -1 off-hand penalty. The tail may be hidden under clothes, although this negates its benefits.
