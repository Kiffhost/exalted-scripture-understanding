Sensing an opening, the Solar strikes with surpassing speed. Immediately after making awithering attack which lowers an opponent’s current Initiative from a value greater to a value less than the Solar’s own, she may use this Charm to unleash a second attack against that opponent. This second attack may be withering or decisive.
