The Sidereal entrusts her arrow to the world, confident that it will find a worthy mark. The Sidereal makes an attack without choosing a target, instead designating a point within her weaponâ€™s range. After the attack roll, she may choose an enemy within close range of that point to attack. Potential targets must use defensive [[Charms]] before she rolls.
