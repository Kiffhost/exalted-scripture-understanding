*The Sidereal lends her favor to those who move within Mercury’s purview, easing their travels by land, sea, or air.*
The Sidereal blesses another character with good fortune on a journey named by her: sailing to a certain port, traveling through a certain forest, pursuing a certain Anathema, etc. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one Willpower for others.
Blessing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options.
Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece.
The blessed character gains −1 target number on Athletics, Resistance, Ride, Sail, and Survival rolls involving the journey outside of combat. This also applies to any guide who leads the blessed character, the pilot of any vehicle he travels on, and any mount he rides.
Additionally, once per session, the blessed character’s player may invoke a stroke of good luck, making a dramatic edit to aid him in his journey.
### Celestial Navigator Counsel (The Ship’s Wheel)
The Sidereal’s target sets out on a journey, path, route, or course of action at her advice. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively.
### Duty’s Reward Benediction (The Messenger)
The Sidereal’s target performs a service for her as part of his official duties or employment.
### Endeavor-Sustaining Labors (The Mast)
The Sidereal’s target pays her for her labor.
### Heaven-Sent Crew Auspice (The Captain)
The Sidereal’s target aids her in reaching her destination or overcoming an obstacle.
### Stray Dog Gratitude (The Gull)
The Sidereal’s target performs an act of kindness for a subordinate, a manual laborer, someone who’s unhoused, or an animal.
The Sidereal can bless multiple characters with this Charm.
