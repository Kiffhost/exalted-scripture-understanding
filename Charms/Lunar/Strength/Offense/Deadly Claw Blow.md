Thews surging with savage might, the Lunar deals a telling blow. She can roll nonranged attacks with heavy weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons using Strength instead of Dexterity. Such attack rolls don’t benefit from effects that grant bonus Strength dots, double successes on Strength rolls, or replace the Lunar’s Strength with a higher value. She always uses her unmodified Strength to attack, and doesn’t add dice from bonus Strength dots or double non-10 successes on attack rolls.
