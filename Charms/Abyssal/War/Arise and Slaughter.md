*Speaking with calm and unquestionable authority, Death’s Lawgiver stirs the corpses of the battlefield to take up arms in her name.*
The Abyssal can use a rally for numbers action to restore Magnitude to a mindless undead battle group, adding (Essence) successes and ignoring the once-perscene limitation on that action.
If there aren’t any allied zombie battle groups, the Abyssal can instead make this roll at difficulty 1 to animate a Size 1 battle group of zombies (Exalted, p. 502) with poor Drill and Might 1. There must be sufficient corpses on the battlefield for her to animate. With 5+ successes, the battle group has Size 2.
If the Abyssal has Horror-in-Parallel Assembly, she can instead create corpse-soldiers (p. XX) as long as her stunt incorporates her medical prowess.
