Slamming Death at the Root into the earth, the wielder unleashes a shockwave that disrupts the flow of dragon lines. While in a demesne or manse, she rolls (Intelligence + [Craft (Geomancy) or Melee]) at difficulty (its Merit rating), suppressing that siteâ€™s supernatural properties within close range for the scene, plus an additional range band for every two successes. This includes increased mote recovery for characters attuned to the site, their ability to sense Essence use within the disrupted region, and any other supernatural properties. A demesne or manse can only be disrupted by one use of this Evocation at a time. N/A-rated demesnes and manses, like the Imperial Manse, are immune to this Evocation. 

## Resonant

If the wielder rolls 3+ extra successes, her attack is reset (Exalted, p. 255).
