*The Dragon-Blood moves with the grace of a secret current, flowing past the notice of her enemies.*
She rerolls 6s on a [[Stealth]] roll until they cease to appear, and gains a point of [[Initiative]] if she beats the opposed rolls of all enemies. In Water Aura, when the Exalt gains [[Initiative]] with this Charm, she may choose one of the enemies she beat with her [[Stealth]] roll, causing him to lose one [[Initiative]].
