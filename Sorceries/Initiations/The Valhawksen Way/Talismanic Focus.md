The sorcerer can prepare an ofuda, cloth-doll talisman, engraved curse tablet, or similar ritual implement with a difficulty 2 ([[Intelligence]] + {appropriate [[Craft]] or [[Linguistics]]}) roll; a difficulty 4 roll provides effectively as many talismans as the sorcerer requires. Once per scene, the sorcerer may incorporate a talisman into a [[Shape Sorcery]] roll, destroying it, to accrue an additional (higher of Essence or 3) [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery|sorcerous motes]]. Talismans can only be used by the sorcerer who created them, and only remain potent for a week.
