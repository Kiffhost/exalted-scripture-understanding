The Lunar wears ten thousand faces, yet she’s always herself. She alters her current form’s appearance: increasing or reducing her height by 10 inches; increasing or decreasing her weight by up to 10%; altering her apparent age; changing or removing sexual characteristics; changing skin tone, eye color, and hair color and length; and/or cosmetic changes like adding scars or birthmarks. She can alter both human and animal forms. The Lunar can conceal her identity with this transformation. She makes an ([Appearance or Intelligence] + [Larceny, Performance, or Presence]) disguise roll instantly, ignoring penalties for lacking equipment or disguising her race, sex, or body type. However, she can’t imitate specific individuals. Changes made with this Charm are permanent. A second use, the Willpower cost of which is waived, can undo such changes.
