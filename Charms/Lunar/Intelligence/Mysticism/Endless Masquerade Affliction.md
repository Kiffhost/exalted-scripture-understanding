Pronouncing a baleful curse, the Lunar traps a foe inside the face and life of another. Using [[Insidious Lunar Transformation]], she may turn a target into a human whose shape she possesses, per Lunar shapeshifting. She adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on her [[Intelligence]] roll, and extends the transformation’s duration to (1 + extra successes) weeks.
