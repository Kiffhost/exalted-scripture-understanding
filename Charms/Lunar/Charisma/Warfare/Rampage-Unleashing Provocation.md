Unified Pack Tactic TheLunarwhipsanallyintoafrenzywithfeverishmusic, stinging taunts, or battle chants. She makes a (Charisma + [Performance or Presence]) inspire roll targeting one willing ally. He must assert his Resolve, unmodified by Intimacies. Success fills him with berserker rage for the scene, granting +1 Resolve against fear-based influence for every two extra successes the Lunar rolled (minimum +1), and one bonus dot of Strength. However, this frenzy prevents him from fleeing or surrendering. He can spend one Willpower to end the frenzy. This Charm can also unleash the greater battle-rages of the Chosen. A Lunar with Relentless Lunar Fury (p. XX) may use it if the influence is successful. Other Exalted can reflexively use one Simple Charm that creates a battle-rage, like Battle Fury Focus (Exalted, p. 378), upon success.
