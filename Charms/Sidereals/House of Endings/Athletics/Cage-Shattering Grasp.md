*The Sidereal refuses untimely conclusions to her journeys, from manacles to a demon’s petrifying gaze.*
The Sidereal adds a free full Excellency on a feat of demolition against something that restrains her, blocks her movement, or otherwise impedes her physical freedom. She ignores any penalties from such restraints or limitations — even if her entire body is bound in chains, she can shatter them with breath control alone.
For a one-Willpower surcharge, the Sidereal can use this feat to shatter an ongoing magical effect that impedes her physical freedom. Such feats’ minimum Strength and difficulty equal the (Essence + 2) of the character responsible for the effect. This can’t affect sorcerous workings or similar permanent magics.
