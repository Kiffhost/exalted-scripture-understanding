The Lunar grows redundant organs, reinforced muscle, and hardened bones. If she would magically heal levels of damage while her health track is undamaged, she gains that many temporary −0 health levels, maximum ([[Essence]]). This doesn’t function if she’s crashed. These temporary levels are the first to be filled when she’s damaged, and vanish when damaged.
