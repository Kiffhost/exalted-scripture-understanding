The Sidereal is unflinching in doing what she must, imposing her order on the world and thereby forcing it to yield up its power. A successful instill, inspire, or threaten roll with any Ability awards the Sidereal one mote. If her influence aligned with one of her Principles of ambition, conviction, confidence, or arrogance, she gains ([[Intimacy]] + 1) motes instead. This can’t exceed the number of motes spent enhancing the roll. When the Sidereal upholds a Major or Defining Principle of ambition, conviction, confidence, or arrogance, she may gain five motes in place of the [[Willpower]] she’d normally receive.
