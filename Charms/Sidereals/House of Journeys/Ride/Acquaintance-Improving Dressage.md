Putting faithful servants through their paces, the Sidereal draws forth hidden depths. The Sidereal trains an animal — including one apotheosized with [[Spirit-Shape Companion]] — in a latent special ability or Merit (Exalted, p. 554), rolling ([Charisma or [[Manipulation]] + [[Ride]]). She doesn’t need to meet the usual specialty requirements and shortens the training interval to one week. If the Sidereal knows Breaking the Wild [[Mortal]], she can instead train its targets or characters who’re otherwise immune to her arcane fate, letting them go into [[Experience Debt]] to gain specialties of “Serving the Sidereal” in up to (Sidereal’s [[Essence]] +1) Abilities or (her Essence/2, rounded up) dots of [[Willpower]]. Training time is reduced to one week. With [[Ride]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a two-experience surcharge to grant an animal familiar a magical ability, spirit familiars a spirit Charm, or someone immune to her arcane fate a Sidereal Charm, [[Martial Arts]] Charm, [[Eclipse]] Charm, spell, or thaumaturgical ritual she knows that they qualify to learn. The surcharge is waived the first time she uses this Charm, and when she uses it on player characters. Spent experience is regained. Experience spent this way is regained if the beneficiary dies.
