Enduring hardship, pain, and even loneliness, the Lawgiver draws renewing strength from the bond she has with a trusted mount. Each time the Lawgiver ends a combat scene riding, and each time she engages a dangerous situation with the aid of her mount and survives, she gains a number of motes equal to her Essence, and a single point of temporary Willpower. When a scene ends in which the Solar has accomplished a major goal with the help of her mount, subtract a point of Limit as well.
