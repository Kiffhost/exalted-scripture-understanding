*The Abyssal’s words corrode her victim’s convictions, distorting passions and beliefs into warped mockeries of themselves.*
The Abyssal makes a special instill roll against a single character, assailing one of his positive Minor or Major Ties. She must leverage an [[Intimacy]] of at least the same intensity as the one targeted. If successful, the targeted Tie’s emotional context is inverted into a negative one. The Abyssal chooses the Tie’s new context, though it must be a fitting thematic opposite of the original context: turning love to hatred, or respect to disdain,. This costs three [[Willpower]] to resist.
This Charm can affect Defining Ties towards mortals, or towards those to whom the Abyssal has a negative Defining Tie.
