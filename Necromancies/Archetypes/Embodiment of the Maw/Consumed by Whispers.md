While shaping a spell, the necromancer may invoke her [[Whispers]] to reflexively roll ([[Whispers]] x2) dice, gaining necromantic motes equal to her successes. She adds ([[Essence]]) automatic successes on this roll when shaping her control spell. Either during the same scene or in the scene that follows, she suffers the consequences of a failed [[Willpower]] roll against the [[Derangement#Madness|Madness Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 168).
