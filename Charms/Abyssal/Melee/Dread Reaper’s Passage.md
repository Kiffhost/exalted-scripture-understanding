*The deathknight passes across the battlefield like a shadow, undeterred by those who stand between her and the next to die.*
The Abyssal can move away from an enemy at close range without needing to disengage as long as she moves into close range with another enemy and makes an attack against him that turn. She can use Brawl, Martial Arts, or Melee to make the attack.
