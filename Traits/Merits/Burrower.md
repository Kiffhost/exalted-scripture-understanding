The mutant can dig through earth with spade-like paws or similar adaptations. She adds two dice on feats of strength related to tunneling or excavating. She can take cover (Exalted, p. 199) with (Strength + Athletics) by digging into soil or loose earth, even in completely open terrain, gaining light cover and the concealment needed to attempt Stealth. Tunneling takes too long to accomplish in combat; she must resurface to take move actions.
