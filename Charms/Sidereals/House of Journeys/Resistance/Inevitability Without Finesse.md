*Grasping the skeins of her enemy’s fate in her clutched fist, the Sidereal forges an unalterable path between the momentum behind her attack and his heart.*
The Sidereal chooses an enemy she can perceive who’s at medium range or further from her. She gains the following benefits
- Each time she moves a range band toward him, she steals one Initiative from him.
- She doesn’t need to disengage to move away from other enemies as long as she’s moving toward him.
- When the Sidereal reaches close range with the chosen enemy, this Charm ends, and she may reflexively make a withering or decisive attack against him. If his Initiative is at least five points lower than hers, the attack is unblockable and undodgeable.
This Charm ends if the Sidereal is crashed or if she moves away from her target.
## Reset
Once per scene.
