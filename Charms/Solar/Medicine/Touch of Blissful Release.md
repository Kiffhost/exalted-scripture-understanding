With just a touch, the Solar can alleviate the suffering of a sick or wounded individual. The patient feels a narcotic surge as the pain of his symptoms dulls away almost completely. This allows the Solar to ease the pains of childbirth, surgery, or invasive illnesses and other injury for up to ([[Essence]]) hours. This Charm removes up to -3 in wound or illness penalties. This effect wears off if the patient engages in any activity that would require him to leave bed for more than a handful of minutes.
