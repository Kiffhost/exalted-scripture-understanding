The Dragon-Blood distills her Essence into a venom that burns her presence from the senses of her enemies. While in concealment, she makes a decisive unexpected attack.
Hitting conveys a poison that must be resisted with ([lower of Perception or Stamina] + Resistance). It has Damage 2i/round (L in Crash), Duration (her current Stealth successes) rounds, and a –1 penalty. This penalty increases to –4 on rolls opposing the Dragon-Blood’s Stealth.
