The Exalt has refined her control of the Whirlwind Shield Technique to create invisible armor out of swirling air. While that Charm is active, she gains Hardness equal to the whirlwind’s Initiative. If the whirlwind’s Parry blocks an attack from close range, the attacker suffers one die of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. This Charm is incompatible with armor.
