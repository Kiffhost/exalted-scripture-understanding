*The Abyssal casts aside the possibility that she might fail her patient, annihilating every error and imperfection from her treatment.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a [[Medicine]] roll to reroll all failed dice. If at least half of the rerolled dice roll successes (round down), she gains one [[Willpower]].
