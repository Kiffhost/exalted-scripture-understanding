*The Solarâ€™s genius hands can outwit even the sharpest eye.*
This Charm allows her to hide any object small enough to palm. She may appear to swallow the item, fit it under her tongue, hide it up her sleeve, etc. The object vanishes. It does not go to Elsewhere. It merely ceases to exist until the Exalt needs it again, at which point she may will it into her hand with just a thought. The Exalt may hide no more than five objects, but each object must be hidden in a separate space.
