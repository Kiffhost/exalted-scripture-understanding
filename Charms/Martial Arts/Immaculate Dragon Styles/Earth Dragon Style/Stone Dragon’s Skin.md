*Unbowed by pain, the Immaculate withstands blow after blow.*
She ignores (Stamina/2, rounded up) points of wound penalties to her [[Defense|Parry]]. Against withering attacks, she adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) natural soak; against decisive attacks, she adds +1 to her [[Hardness]] from armor or other magic. 
This Charm costs one mote less in medium armor, and two motes less in light armor. While unarmored, it costs two motes less and the [[Initiative]] cost is waived.
