Reflexes honed by [[Essence]], the Lunar defends faster than her foes can imagine. Successfully defending against an attack grants one [[Initiative]], and she can parry lethal damage barehanded. If her attackerâ€™s [[Initiative]] is lower than hers or he rolls any 1s, she gains +1 [[Defense]]. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]], this Charm may be declared after the attack roll.
