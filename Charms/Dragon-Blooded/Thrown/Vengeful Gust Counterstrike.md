TheswirlingwindssurroundingtheDragon-Bloodspin with deadly force, deflecting blades and arrows while gouging deep cuts along her foes. While Whirlwind Shield Technique is active, the Dragon-Blood may reflexively clash an attack from out to short range with a decisive attack, with damage equal to the whirlwind’s Initiative. This doesn’t count as her combat action or reset her to base Initiative. Success resets the whirlwind to three Initiative; on a failure, the clashed attack strikes the whirlwind instead of the Exalt.
