*The Infernal’s presence grows to fill the entire universe for those who behold her, blotting out such trivial irrelevancies as who they once were.*

If a character can perceive the Infernal and is aware of a Tie that she has toward herself or an Intimacy expressing how she sees herself, he also counts as having that Intimacy at Minor intensity, though the Intimacy’s precise nature may change to fit his perspective. For instance, if the Infernal has a Tie of pride to herself, onlookers might have Ties of admiration imposed on them. The imposed Intimacy’s Resolve penalty is increased by one against the Infernal’s influence.

If a character uses the imposed Intimacy to bolster their Resolve against influence, cites it in a Decision Point, or uses it for other purposes, he may treat it as having the full intensity of the Infernal’s Intimacy, rather than being Minor. Doing so strengthens the Intimacy by one step and prevents that character from voluntarily weakening it for a day, which stacks.

If the Infernal is using [[Inexorable Ego Vortex]], affected characters also gain its Resolve bonus and reroll dice on influence rolls.
