*The martial artist channels the flow of her Essence into a tenfold pattern of harmonious completion.*
The stylist can use this Charm after being hit by an attack but before the damage roll, halving the damage she suffers, rounded down. If she used Spiritual Perfection, this Charm’s Willpower cost is waived, and she still gains the benefits of a successful clash if she doesn’t take damage. 
## Reset
This Charm can only be used against decisive damage once per scene unless reset by going a round without suffering any damage or harmful effects.
