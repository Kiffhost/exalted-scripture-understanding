*Utterly in control of her body’s slightest involuntary acts, the Lunar makes no sound save when she wishes to.*
Any actions she takes with any Attribute become perfectly silent for this Charm’s duration, undetectable by hearing-based rolls. 
Indirect consequences of her action are still audible: If she discharges a fire wand, it will make no sound, but her victim’s cry of pain or the sound of ignited scenery burning will.
