*Wreathed in the primeval fear of death, the Abyssal surpasses her victim’s worst nightmares.*
When the Abyssal makes a threaten roll, she can leverage her target’s strongest Tie of fear as though she were its object. She doesn’t have to know what this Intimacy is, nor does she learn it.
If she’s already the object of her target’s strongest Intimacy of fear (or tied for it), she instead adds non-Charm dice equal to the intensity of the target’s next-strongest Intimacy of fear, and the cost to resist increases by one Willpower.
If the Abyssal’s target has no Ties of fear, she’s refunded this Charm’s Willpower cost.
