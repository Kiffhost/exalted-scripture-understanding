*The Infernal focuses the fullness of her hatred into a single arrow.*

The Infernal spends a scene crafting a projectile dedicated to the annihilation of someone she has a negative Defining Tie to. No roll is necessary, though the Infernal gains craft points as if it were a major project if she has an applicable Craft.

The projectile provides the following benefits:
- As long as the Infernal has it nocked or loaded in a readied weapon, she can sense whether her nemesis is within that weapon's base range. She can't discern his location, but can attack him without needing to know where he is as long as he's within this range, guided by hate alone.
- When she attacks her nemesis, she adds a free full Excellency on the attack roll and gains ten motes and one Willpower to spend on Archery Charms that enhance the attack.
- A decisive attack against her nemesis adds attack roll extra successes as dice of damage and deals aggravated damage.
- A withering attack against her nemesis ignores soak.
- She waives [[Reality-Rending Assault]] cost. She can use it even if she can't perceive her nemesis as long as he's within long range.

The Infernal can only have one such projectile at a time. If her Tie for her nemesis falls below Defining, the projectile crumbles into ash.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by killing a nemesis with the dedicated projectile.
