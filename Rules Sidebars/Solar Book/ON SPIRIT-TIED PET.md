The first time a Solar uses this Charm, ignore the 1xp activation cost. A Solar with [[Beast-Mastering Behavior]] gains ([[Essence]]) automatic successes to this roll, and shortens the interval of the roll to one week. Using this Charm exempts her from the specialty requirements of normal training, while the Charm [[Friendship with Animals Approach]] may eliminate the penalty associated with wild or hostile animals.
At [[Survival]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, the Solar can teach a familiar she has enhanced with [[Spirit-Tied Pet]] to use magical abilities, such as the eagleâ€™s special ability Iron Wings Carry. Doing so costs the Solar two experience points per ability trained.The player and the Storyteller can work together to develop new and appropriate abilities for the Solar to teach her familiar.
Also at [[Survival]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, the Exalt can use [[Beast-Mastering Behavior]] on a familiar she has enhanced with [[Bestial Traits Technique]], to teach it to use a special ability that it can only use during [[Deadly Predator Method]], for a cost of two experience points. Such abilities need not be wholly appropriate for the animal in question. A flying squirrel might gain the power to generate a charge like an electric eel, while a tyrant lizard might learn to spit a fireball from its mouth.
