*The Iron Wolf’s gaze cannot be misdirected, and her focus cannot be dissuaded.*
Even the greatest feats of stealth pale before her genius eyes. When a character attempts to hide from the Solar, steal from her, or cheat her with a quick motion, revert ([[Essence]]) of his double successes— typically 10s, but 9s under the effect of double 9s and so on—to single successes. This effect can even contest magic that is considered impossible to notice. The benefit of this Charm only applies to the Solar—it is her eye which is unswerving. The player can choose to activate this Charm after the opposing roll has been made.
