*The Abyssal is not seen to rise — one moment, she lies prostrate; the next, she stands light on her feet.*
The Abyssal reflexively rises from prone (Exalted, p.
198), doubling 9s. This doesn’t count as her move action and can be done outside her turn. If she uses this Charm upon waking from sleep or while resting, she waives its cost and doubles 8s if a roll is necessary.
