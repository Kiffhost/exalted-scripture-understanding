The Sidereal’s comprehensive body of knowledge lets her recognize and expose the flaws in another’s argument, citing an authority he has yet to read. The Sidereal opposes an influence roll with an introduce fact roll, presenting contradictory evidence. She converts [[Resolve]] bonuses, like those from Intimacies, to automatic successes on the roll. If she succeeds, she defends against the influence (if it targeted her) and adds (extra successes/2, rounded up) to the [[Resolve]] of others targeted by the influence. Multiple uses of this Charm don’t stack their [[Resolve]] bonus. This Charm doesn’t count against the once-per-scene limit on introducing facts.
