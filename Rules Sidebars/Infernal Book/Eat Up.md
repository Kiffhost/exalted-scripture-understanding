Infernal Charms that evoke the Yozi Metagaos often provide additional benefits against things the Infernal can eat. By default, this includes anything that an ordinary human could consume for sustenance. It need not be in safe condition for eating — spoiled food, rotting corpses, or poisonous fungi all qualify. Other Chams may expand the range of what the Infernal’s capable of eating.
