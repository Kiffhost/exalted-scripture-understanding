The Dragon-Blood lets her scorn overflow into her words, her sarcasm and ridicule slowly wearing down even the strongest-rooted beliefs. She writes a mocking message or satire that conveys an instill roll to erode a specific Principle or positive Tie. Her mockery inflicts momentary doubts on even the most dedicated readers, preventing them from drawing on the targeted [[Intimacy]] to bolster their [[Resolve]].
