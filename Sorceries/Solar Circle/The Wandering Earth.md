*The sorcerer catalyses an inchoate elemental intelligence from the world’s Essence, sending the very land a-wandering.*

The sorcerer spends a day pacing the perimeter of a discrete region covering at least several acres, up to the size of a large town or city district, shedding drops of her blood with each step. A terrestrial god governing this region, such as a city mother or forest king, can recognize the spell’s growing influence over their purview with a difficulty 5 (Perception + Occult) roll.

Upon the ritual’s completion, the region becomes independently mobile. It can rise up to short range above ground level and travel up to 100 miles per day. The area atop (or within) the region is undisturbed by its movement, but the area in its wake is utterly trampled by its sheer weight — though its movement is slow enough that there’s ample time to avoid it.

The sorcerer sets the region’s movement patterns when she casts this spell. It follows them with animal-like intelligence, and can follow directions that involve responding to environmental conditions such as weather, dragon lines, large obstacles, or nearby resources. The sorcerer might command it to migrate between specific areas, move only at night, seek out ore deposits, avoid warzones, and so on.

The region develops a sacred site that can be attuned as though it were a demesne (Exalted, p. 161). If the region already contains a demesne or manse, it becomes the sacred site instead. Those attuned to this site can commune with the region’s intelligence and request adjustments to its movement patterns, though these are reluctant and temporary. Making a single permanent change requires an Ambition 2 Celestial Circle working by someone attuned to the site, though it doesn’t cost experience.

The region’s nature and mode of locomotion depend on the element it’s most closely tied to. This is usually determined by the character of the region of itself, but the sorcerer can impose a different elemental nature by making significant sacrifices suited to the chosen aspect.

 - **Air**: The region glides on cloud-wings and a cushion of wind-fins. It can rise up to long range from the ground and fly through mid-air for several miles before harmlessly descending. Those aboard are protected from extremes of weather and always have clear, breathable air. Land in its wake is swept flat and frozen, but cleansed of impurities.
- **Earth**: The region stomps on crushing turtle-legs of living rock. It can tunnel underground or through mountains at half-speed without endangering those aboard and isn’t slowed by solid obstacles that are smaller than it. Sources of stone and veins of ore within the region replenish over time, providing those aboard with a steady supply of such resources. Land in its wake is flattened, but mineral veins are drawn up into its footprints.
- **Fire**: The region grinds on great wheels of molten rock and burning ore. Those within close range of its base suffer a difficulty 4, Damage 5L/round environmental hazard. It can suppress this hazard if directed to as part of its movement patterns. Those aboard always have light and warmth. Land in its wake is scorched, but left rich with volcanic ash.
- **Water**: The region sails atop a serpent-tail of rushing waves. It can move twice as fast over bodies of water. Endless springs and wells are available to those aboard, ensuring a constant water supply. Land in its wake is flooded, but the waters are unusually clean.
- **Wood**: The region lumbers on spindly root-legs and branch-arms. It can climb over and around most obstacles without slowing or destroying them. Those aboard enjoy an abundance of vegetation, which flourishes even in the most arid soil. Its passage is less destructive than those of other aspects and scatters growth in its wake.
# Control
An elemental token or talisman forms at the region’s sacred site when this spell is cast. If the sacred site already produces a hearthstone, it becomes the token. As long as the sorcerer bears it, she can maintain her attunement to the region from afar, as if it were a manse’s hearthstone, though it provides none of a hearthstone’s other benefits. She can use it to commune with the region’s intelligence at any distance.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 30)
This spell can only be distorted from within short range of its sacred site. The distorting sorcerer makes a single change to the region’s movement patterns that applies the next time it becomes relevant, though only once. He might change the next destination in its circuit or cause it to ignore a prohibition on passing through inhabited areas the next time it comes across one.
