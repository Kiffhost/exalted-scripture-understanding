**Example Manse**: A monolith of tapering basalt surrounded by concentric rose gardens, the path always strewn with unexpected briars.
When a target touches this rose-cut beryl, the bearer intuits one of the target’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] rooted in betrayal, abandonment, unfulfilled desire, or similar, chosen by the [[Storyteller]]. If the stone’s bearer makes an [[Influence roll]] that leverages the revealed [[Intimacy]] in the same scene, its [[Resolve]] penalty is increased by one against that roll (but not later rolls in the same scene). Touching the stone to an unwilling character uses the same rules as other [[touch attacks]] (p. XX).
