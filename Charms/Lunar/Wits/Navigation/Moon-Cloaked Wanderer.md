*The Lunar flits across maps like a passing shadow.*
While traveling along a course charted with [[Lodestone Reckoning Manner]], she can add its successes on rolls to cover tracks, [[Stealth]] rolls to evade guards or enemies, or [[Larceny]] rolls to circumvent manned obstacles like checkpoints. With [[Wits]] 4, [[Essence]] 2, she can spend three motes when she adds banked successes this way to also grant them to ([[Essence]] x2) companions, as a Charm bonus.

A Lunar whose spirit shape is migratory can learn this as a [[Perception]] Charm.
