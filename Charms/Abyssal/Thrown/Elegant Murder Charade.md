*The deathknight shifts gracefully between murder and light conversation.*
The Abyssal passes off violence or combat as a prank, tryst, or harmless mishap. For instance, after slitting her target’s throat at a party, she might make him look as if he simply spilled his wine or explain away his listlessness as mere intoxication. She reflexively makes a special (Manipulation + {Larceny, Presence, or Socialize}) instill roll against all bystanders not directly involved in it, adding (Essence) non-Charm successes. Targets who are participating in a social event, recreation, or sensual pleasure count as having a Minor Intimacy that supports this influence.
A character can spend one Willpower to resist this if circumstances change dramatically in a way that undermines the Abyssal’s lie or if his ignorance poses a threat to a Major or Defining Intimacy.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses this Charm immediately after an attack enhanced with Stifled Cry Pantomime, she reduces this Charm’s cost by one mote for each round of silence inflicted.
