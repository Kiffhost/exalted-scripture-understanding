Honing her predatory focus, the Lunar marks her prey for death as she speeds across the battlefield. She may take a move action and aim on the same turn, and can flurry an aim with a rush or disengage. If she moves toward a foe and aims at him with [[Hunter’s Eye Precision]] on the same turn, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has a vision-enhancing Merit may learn this as a [[Perception]] Charm.
