Grasping the skeins of her enemy’s fate in her clutched fist, the Sidereal forges an unalterable path between the momentum behind her attack and his heart. The Sidereal chooses an enemy at medium range or beyond. Each time she moves a range band closer to him, he loses one Initiative, which she gains. If she moves into close range with him for the first time after using this Charm and makes an attack, it’s unblockable and undodgeable. Once the Sidereal’s reached close range with her target, this Charm ends. It also ends if she’s crashed or if she moves away from her target. Reset: Once per scene.
