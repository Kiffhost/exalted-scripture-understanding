*The Lunar becomes a monstrous avatar of doubt, a living denial of her prey’s deepest-felt convictions.*
She makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + {Presence or Socialize}) instill roll against a character she’s spent at least a scene interacting with, embodying the antithesis of one of his Defining Principles that she’s aware of. That [[Intimacy]] can’t bolster his [[Resolve]] against this influence, which can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]]. If she succeeds, her target suffers the following effects: 
- −2 [[Guile]] and [[Resolve]] against her. 
- While he can perceive her, he can’t use the targeted [[Intimacy|Principle]] to increase his [[Resolve]] or in [[Decision Points]]. 
- ActingagainstthePrinciplewhilehecanperceive the Lunar causes him to lose one [[Willpower]] and roll an extra die for [[Limit]] (if applicable). If he has no [[Willpower]], he can’t act against that [[Intimacy]]. 
- He can’t read her intentions unless he spends one [[Willpower]]. 
- When he encounters a situation where the [[Intimacy|Principle]] is relevant, the Lunar intuitively realizes this and receives a brief description of that situation. The victim can end this influence by completing eroding the targeted [[Intimacy|Principle]], or by winning a noteworthy victory over the Lunar: besting her in combat, swaying an audience against her in a debate, driving a rival business led by her into bankruptcy, etc. Ending this influence by triumphing against the Lunar grants the victim one [[Willpower]] and lets him shed one [[Limit]], and also renders the targeted [[Intimacy|Principle]] immune to subsequent uses of this Charm by her. This Charm can only be used against a character once per story.
