The Sidereal has no time for delay. If she’s aware of an enemy or threat, she’ll take immediate and decisive action to deal with it using the most extreme measures possible. She can choose what methods she employs, but can’t take any half measures. She need not commit her every waking hour to this, but must make it her utmost priority. When facing multiple threats, she may choose whether to prioritize the most imminent problem or the most severe one.
This ends if the Sidereal loses a battle she initiated because of this Hubris.
