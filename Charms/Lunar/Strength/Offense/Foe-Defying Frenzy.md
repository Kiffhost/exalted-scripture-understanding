The Lunar strikes aside her enemies’ blows with superior force. She reflexively clashes an attack with a decisive attack, and can reflexively ready a weapon to do so. If successful, she doesn’t roll damage or reset Initiative. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. A Strength 5, Essence 3 repurchase lets her pay a one-Willpower surcharge to roll decisive damage normally on a successful clash. If this incapacitates a nontrivial foe, she regains that Willpower.
