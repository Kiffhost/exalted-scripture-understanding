*Seven-Finger Wu is a name spoken with both reverence and outrage in the towers of Heaven, as the only thief known to have ever slipped past Yu-Shan’s gates and !!pilferedtheorchardwherethepeachesofimmortalitygrow.!! With a flash of his sword and a rapid sprint, he made off with a severed branch bearing enough sacred fruit to see his life through into the next age.*
He carved the branch into a peachwood walking stick, then disguised himself as a wandering hermit before stealing into Heaven a second time. With cunning, deception, and sheer nerve, he disguised himself as an elder Sidereal Exalt and hoodwinked a newly Exalted neonate into banding the staff with starmetal, completing the artifact for him before he absconded once again. With [[Gnomon]] in hand, Seven-Finger Wu’s legend grew greater as he cheated time itself. He stole the ruby eye of !!HesieshfromaSolar’sweddingbandasitwasbeingplaced!! !!onherfingerbyherLunarmate.Heleftanelegantpoemin!! !!theprivateofficesofAnysSyn’scelestialmansepraisingher!! prowess in pursuing him. However, when the Ichneumon Aeon arose from the Wyld, he banded together with his hunters to destroy the temporal predator, sacrificing his life to save Anys Syn from a fatal century-blow. Out of respect, she had the staff buried in the [[Night]] Caste’s tomb. Its location is lost to all but her, but legends of a peach tree of immortality that’s taken root in Creation have caught the ears of savants and scavenger princes alike. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Gnomon]]

Seven-Finger Wu’s trickery endowed [[Gnomon]] with an illusory mantle of celestial legitimacy. This quirk in destiny fools any [[Sidereal Exalted]] or god who works for the [[Lore/Factions/Bureau of Destiny|Bureau of Destiny]] into thinking that the staff’s wielder is a legitimate agent of Heaven. This is equivalent to a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of trust.
