*The Abyssal’s form blurs and fades, eerily translucent and featureless when visible at all.*
The Abyssal adds ([[Essence]]) successes on [[Stealth]] rolls. She doesn’t need a hiding place to roll [[Stealth]] for concealment.
Attacking or moving between range bands suppresses this Charm’s benefits until the end of the Abyssal’s next turn. This Charm ends if she’s hit by an attack.
