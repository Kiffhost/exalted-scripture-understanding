*Drawing from the eternal core of her Exaltation, the Sidereal floods her body, mind, and [[Essence]] with unassailable divinity.*
The Sidereal adds a free full Excellency on a roll or static value using any Ability against a Psyche effect, Shaping effect, or any effect that interferes with her [[Essence]] or magic — ending an ongoing Charm, stealing motes, breaking attunement to an artifact, etc. If the opposing effect is unrolled, she instead forces an opposed (temporary [[Willpower]]) roll, gaining −1 target number on it. Against unrolled environmental effects, the Storyteller sets a difficulty. Personal motes spent on this Charm still increase the Sidereal’s anima.
