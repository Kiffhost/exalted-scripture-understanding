*The Infernal launches forward with superhuman speed, trailing strobing afterimages as blinding as the Brilliant Wind of Hell.*

The Infernal can use this Charm on her tick before moving between range bands. The initial burst of strobing light creates a blinding flash, while the force of her acceleration makes the earth tremble. All other characters within close range — friend or foe — must make a difficulty 3 roll using the lower of their (Dexterity + Athletics) and (Wits + Awareness). On a failed roll, they’re knocked prone and are blinded until the end of their next turn, suffering a −3 penalty on rolls that depend on vision.

The Infernal’s superhuman speed converts the dice from [[Wind-Born Stride]] to non-Charm successes. Outside of combat, she moves with incredible speed, capable of maintaining (Dexterity x10) miles per hour over open terrain. However, the strobing afterimages render concealment impossible, like a bonfire anima.

This Charm ends if the Infernal stops moving.
