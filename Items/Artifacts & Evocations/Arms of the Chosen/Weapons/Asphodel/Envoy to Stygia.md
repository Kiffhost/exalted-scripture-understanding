*This Evocation upgrades [[Spirit-Detecting Glance]] (Exalted, p.*
354), allowing the wielder to perceive dematerialized ghosts even while it isn’t active. If she knows [[All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight]] (Exalted, p. 356), she may perceive the flow of deathly [[Essence]], the magic of ghosts and other un-Exalted undead, and the borders of shadowlands while it isn’t active. Non-[[Solar Exalted]] may awaken this Evocation to enhance [[Charms]] that have a similar function. For example, a Dragon-Blooded could learn it to enhance [[Spirit-Detecting Mirror Technique]], letting her observe dematerialized ghosts in mirrors even while it isn’t active. 

## Special activation rules

Unless the Exalt is dissonant with soulsteel, this Evocation awakens for no experience cost when she first attunes to [[Asphodel]].
