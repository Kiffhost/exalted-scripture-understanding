*The deathknight imbues her patient with unliving resilience, lest he succumb to the rigors of her treatment.*
The Abyssal grants a character a number of temporary −0 health levels equal to her Essence. These temporary levels are the first to be filled and vanish when damaged.
When used on animated corpses, this Charm costs only five motes, or one mote for trivial characters.
Death’s Essence takes a toll on mortals: once this Charm ends or their last temporary health level is damaged, they suffer a die of bashing damage, ignoring Hardness.
