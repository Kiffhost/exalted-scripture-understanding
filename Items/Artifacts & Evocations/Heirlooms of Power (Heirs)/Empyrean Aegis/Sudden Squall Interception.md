When an ally protected by the wielder’s defend other actions makes a disengage roll or a roll opposing an enemy’s rush, the wielder may throw [[Empyrean Aegis]] between the two characters, adding a non-Charm success on her ally’s roll. If she has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her ally, she adds an additional non-Charm die as well. If she’s using [[Guardian Gale Technique]] to protect her ally from beyond close range, she must pay one [[Initiative]], as though he were being attacked.
