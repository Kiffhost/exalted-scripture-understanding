The Lunar’s spirit shape expresses itself in myriad forms. Upon purchasing this Charm, her player designs an alternative hybrid form, selecting another set of six dots of mutations reflecting her spirit shape (or twelve dots, if she knows [[Beast-Form Empowerment]]). When she uses [[Hybrid Body Transformation]], she can enter either of her hybrid forms, and can change between them as a miscellaneous action while that Charm is active. She may switch between hybrid forms reflexively upon using [[Deadly Beastman Transformation]] (p. XX).
