*The deathly chill of Creation’s end falls upon those who stir the deathknight’s steed to wrath.*
The Abyssal can pay a two-mote, two-[[Initiative]] surcharge when she uses [[Wrathful Steed Revenge]] to suffuse her mount’s attack with unnatural cold. Its target is exposed to a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty (Abyssal’s [[Wits]]) and Damage (Abyssal’s [[Essence]], maximum 5)L, even if the attack misses.
