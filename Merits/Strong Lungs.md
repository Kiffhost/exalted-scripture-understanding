### Prerequisite
[[Athletics]] •••
The character is practiced at holding her breath for long periods of time, like the famed pearl divers of the West.
She may hold her breath for ([[Stamina]] + [[Athletics]]) minutes before she begins to suffocate or drown; under duress, this becomes ({Stamina + Athletics} x 2) rounds.
