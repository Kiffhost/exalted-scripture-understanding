*Feathery white striations run through this blue gemstone.*
Within a two-mile radius, non-aquatic mortals and animals gain increased buoyancy, floating easily atop even the most turbulent waters. Even non-swimmers are unlikely to drown, saving lives among sailors and fisherfolk; pearl divers require heavy ballast to perform their duties. Within the affected area, attempts to swim downward suffer a âˆ’2 penalty, while swimming for the surface adds two bonus dice. Restrain or drag actions to hold someone underwater cost an additional turn of control.
