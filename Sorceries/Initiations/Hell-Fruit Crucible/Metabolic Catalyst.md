Once per scene, when sorcerer ingests a vital part of a significant creature or object, such as a brain or an amulet’s gem, she gains a temporary specialty related to the creature or object until the end of the scene. If she consumes something which already has a magical effect when ingested, like celestial wine, the specialty die is converted to an automatic success.
