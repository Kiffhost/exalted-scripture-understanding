A mystic and visionary, the Lunar realizes uncanny insights. After a scene reading animal entrails, interpreting dreams, imbibing psychedelics, vision questing in the Wyld, performing austerities, or similar, she rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [Integrity, [[Lore]], or Occult]), banking foresight points equal to her successes. She may spend foresight points on the following effects reflexively: 1 point: Reset the once-per-scene limit on introducing a fact, as long as this upholds a Defining [[Intimacy]] or benefits her Solar mate. 3 points: Add (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) sorcerous motes toward shaping a spell. She may use this benefit multiple times on the same spell. 3 points: Gain (higher of [[Essence]] or 5) silver craft points, or ([[Essence]]) gold points. 5 points: Add (Essence/2, rounded up) successes on [[Investigation]], [[Lore]], [[Medicine]] and [[Occult]] rolls for one scene. 5 points: Add +2 [[Resolve]] for one scene. 5 points: Use [[Devil-Pleasing Chiminage]] (p. XX) retroactively. Success reveals she’s already acquired the offering. 5 points: Use Moonlit Apothecary Cauldron (p. XX) retroactively. Success reveals she’s already acquired the medicine. 7 points: Automatically succeed on a roll to introduce or challenge a fact, as long as the Storyteller deems success possible. 7 points: Use Heaven-Darkening [[Eclipse]] (p. XX) retroactively, without needing to roll. Success reveals she’s already prepared a contingency to negate the effect in question. The Lunar must know any [[Charms]] enhanced with foresight points. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by gaining a [[Lore]] background from [[Wayfaring Sage Meditation]].
