*Once per scene, the Lawgiver may deny the very wounds that assail her, striking them from her bodyâ€™s record.*
This Charm allows the Solar to retroactively dodge damage she has already received. Standing still and silent, the Exalt focuses on her wounds for a single round in which she does not attack and does not apply her [[Defense|Parry]] or [[Defense|Evasion]]. Applying such defenses cancels the Charm. At the end of the round, roll her ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]]), unmodified by [[Charms]], and convert the successes into healed -1 and -2 health levels. The Solar steps outside of the moment when she was hurt, casting aside her wounded form and denying its existence.
