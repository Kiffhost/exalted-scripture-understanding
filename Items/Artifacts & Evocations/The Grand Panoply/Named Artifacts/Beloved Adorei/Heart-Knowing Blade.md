Adorei cuts to the quick and finds truth in blood. The first Evocation of Adorei allows any successful decisive damage roll to act as a successful read intentions that checks the target’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] against the Solar’s own and reveals a [[Intimacy|Principle]] or [[Intimacy|Tie]] that aligns with the Solar’s own, or failing that, one that represents the most violent, aggressive, or extreme opposite to one of the Solar’s. The Storyteller chooses which [[Intimacy]] is revealed on a successful attack. 

*Quoth the [[Daiklave]]:* “Sorry lover, it looks like this one wants to be saved.”
