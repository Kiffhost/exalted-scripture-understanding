## [[World-Soul Rite]]
The sorcerer draws power from the Caul or another place of power touched by Gaia’s or Luna’s [[Essence]], like a demesne or manse with an elemental or Lunar aspect. Once per day, she can roll ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) in such a place, gaining sorcerous motes equal to her successes. They last for the rest of the story or until she uses this ritual again.
