Some occur naturally, and many are fakes, but gifted thaumaturgists can create talismans that provide minor but useful benefits to any who carry them. Talismans against disease provide the user with an additional die to all rolls to resist disease and infection. Good luck charms protect the wearer from one botch per story, and charms designed to ward the wearer against the Fair Folk, spirits, elementals, demons or the walking dead cause beings of the appropriate type to suffer a -1 penalty to all their dice pools when attempting to affect the wearer, up to (talisman’s Resources value) times per scene. Each warding charms can only affect one type of creature. Talismans that provide greater bonuses also exist but are rare and extremely difficult to create.
