*Under the bough of a heavy fruit tree in the final spring of Nellens’ life, the Empress bequeathed her consort — a mortal man — the blade that would protect his legacy.*
Before the jealous proxies of the Empress’ daughters and their gossiping servants, she gave him [[Imprimatur]], sheathed in a scabbard of stone from which it couldn’t be drawn, bound by a crimson tassel. Inscribed on the blade she left a message she promised that only Nellens’ heirs would ever read. Nellens passed soon after, but despite the Empress’ proclamation, no heir of any Great House sired by him ever received the blade. It remained in the Empress’ armory until the day she elevated House Nellens. Since then, the blade has become a familiar sight whenever a Nellens Dragon-Blood appears at a heated debate or tense negotiation. For almost a generation, the infamous duelist Nellens Zijiren used it to humiliate his rivals of high social standing, until his recent demise. The sight of [[Imprimatur]] has always meant the same thing for those that oppose House Nellens — an upstart who thinks herself their equal, and a weapon that proves it. 


## [[Evocations]] of [[Imprimatur]] 

Imprimatur’s emblazoned sheath is a seal of the Empress’s approval. This is measured by Renown, which begins at zero and is increased by Imprimatur’s [[Evocations]], up to a maximum of (the wielder’s [[Essence]] + [[Charisma]]). Dragon-Blooded Nellens scions add 1 to Imprimatur’s maximum Renown. Renown resets at the end of every scene. Attuning to [[Imprimatur]] awakens [[As Two Strangers Upon the Road]] at no cost.
