What happens to the middlemarches and bordermarches of the Wyld if a Solar raises the borders of Creation? In some cases, these border regions weaken over time, and eventually the Wyld influence fades. In other cases, the power of the Solarâ€™s shaping completely dispels the Wyld from these regions. Yet in some further cases, the Wyld remains strong in these pockets of unreality. The result should be decided on a case-by-case basis, and should be determined by the intention of the Solar, as well as the phase at which she concludes Wyld-Shaping Technique and the amount of success with which she completes it.
