*The Abyssal has fettered her soul and found eternal life, rising again and again from certain death so long as there is hatred still left in her heart.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she’s incapacitated or would suffer death for any reason, surviving it by calling on a Defining Intimacy protected by Eternal Enmity Approach. She seems to die, yet endures in a torpor that’s indistinguishable from death by anything less than Eye of the Unconquered Sun.
Come the next sunset, the Abyssal rises with all damage and crippling injuries healed, no matter how severe they were.
She may drag herself out of a grave, well, or the ashes of a pyre where hopefuls burned her corpse. The only way her foes can kill her is to wait for her to rise, then try again. She can invoke World-Ending Void Apostle when she rises and can use it with Charms to aid in escaping imprisonment.
In exchange for the Abyssal’s survival, the chosen Intimacy loses Eternal Enmity Approach’s protection for the rest of the story.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses Sworn to Endless Vengeance together with this Charm to swear vengeance on the enemy responsible for her “death,” she waives its Willpower cost. If she successfully takes her revenge, she restores Eternal Enmity Approach’s protection to the chosen Intimacy.
