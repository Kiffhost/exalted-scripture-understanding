*Knowing that all things will cease to exist one day, the deathknight finds strength within herself to hasten things to their ends.*
The Abyssal adds a free full Excellency on a feat of strength and can attempt it even if its physical scale would normally be impossible given her size and leverage. She could punch a hole through a keep’s wall large enough to let a battle group through or lift an entire building.
A feat of demolition can damage or destroy a portion of a large object, extending one range band beyond what she could normally accomplish. A feat of strength can lift objects she’d normally lack the leverage to, as though her grip’s leverage extended one range band beyond what she could normally lift. Every three extra successes extends a feat’s scale by one range band.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by performing a difficulty 10+ feat of strength.
