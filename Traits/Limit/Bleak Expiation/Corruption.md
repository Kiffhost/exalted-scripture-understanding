The Great Curse poisons the Abyssal’s soul, twisting her into a heartless champion of the grave. Whatever compassion they cling to turns to ash, while hatred drowns out the light of hope. All levels of Corruption share three effects: imposing Intimacies, weakening Intimacies, or inflicting Whispers. Imposing Intimacies The Abyssal gains an Intimacy with the same intensity as the Corruption. This can’t be resisted with Willpower, and the Intimacy can’t be weakened by any means for the rest of the session. Examples of suitable Intimacies include
- Negative Ties, especially toward the living.
- Intimacies based on cynicism, despair, or sorrow.
- Principles that reflect a positive outlook on death.
- Principles that align with death’s chivalry.
- Ties of fascination for things that are darkly beautiful, like graveyards, blood, wolves, or spiders.
## Weakening Intimacies
The Corruption weakens an Intimacy of the same intensity or lower. It can’t be restored to its former intensity for the rest of the session. Suitable Intimacies are those antithetical to the kinds of Intimacies that Corruption can inflict. Examples include:
- Positive Ties toward the living.
- Intimacies based on hope, joy, or compassion.
- Principles that reflect a negative outlook on death.
- Principles that run counter to death’s chivalry.
- Intimacies related to things from the Abyssal’s mortal life.
## Imposing Whispers
The Abyssal temporarily gains Whispers (p. XX). Minor Corruption inflicts two-dot Whispers for one session. Major Corruption can inflict two-dot Whispers for one story or four-dot Whispers for one session. Defining Corruption inflicts four-dot Whispers for one story. The Abyssal can gain Whispers permanently for [[experience debt]] (p. XX).
