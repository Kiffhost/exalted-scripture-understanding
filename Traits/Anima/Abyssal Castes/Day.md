The light of day promises safety to the living, but its promise is a lie. Death can come anywhere, at any time, and there is no refuge from it. The Day Caste are the proof of this, the hidden knives of the [[Deathlords]]. Those Who Dwell Among the Wretched walk unseen in Creation, insinuating themselves into mortal communities like wolves hidden among the flock. Only the trail of bodies that litters their their wake betrays their presence, though the Daywalkers are gone long before their victims are found. All that the living can do is weep over the grisly remains as their delusions of safety are shattered forevermore. 
The Children of Blood are masters of subtlety, upholding death’s chivalry from the shadows. Many are killers, well-versed in the arts of unseen death, while others are masters of espionage, [[tracking]], or criminal endeavors. Day Castes serve their lieges as assassins, spymasters, thieves, and saboteurs, both among the living and within the citadels of their Deathlord’s foes. Some act as their liege’s unseen enforcers, leading their Deathlord’s secret police to root out dissent and disloyalty within the ghost-king’s domains. Others deal with the Underworld’s crime syndicates, subverting them to their Deathlord’s ends — or their own. 
The [[Deathlords]] choose many of their Day Castes from those already skilled in subterfuge: grifters, thieves, poisoners, spies, and the like. For other Daywalkers, subtlety isn’t a skill, but a part of their lives, whether by choice or necessity: dissidents under harsh regimes, escaped slaves fleeing pursuit, urchins living on the streets. Some [[Deathlords]] seek only the most callous and hateful of Day Castes, lest the Children of Blood come to feel sympathy for the mortals they must often walk among. 
Some renegade Day Castes sell their services as spies and assassins, commanding a hefty fee for their incomparable prowess. Others turn their skills to political or ideological ends, while others seek a redemption of sorts by hunting down and slaying the wicked. Some renegade Daywalkers never leave their Deathlord’s service, working from within to undermine their liege’s agenda, assassinate key agents, and leak information to powerful rivals.
# Anima Banner
Daywalkers’ Caste Marks mirror those of the Night Caste: empty black circles that bleed from their edges. A Day Caste’s anima banner is typically black and grey, sometimes tinted with sickly greens. It’s sometimes accompanied by whispering voices, stifled screams, or eerie silences, or by the scents of extinguished candles or poisonous flowers.
# Anima Effects
- Caul of Shadows (Permanent): At bonfire anima, the Abyssal’s anima engulfs her in darkness, making it impossible to discern her identity or any details of her experience. This concealment is perfect, defeating even magic like Eye of the Unconquered Sun (Exalted, p. 273). 
- Embrace of Shadows (2m; Reflexive; Instant; Mute): The Daywalker mutes all motes spent in an instant.
- Walking in Daylight (3m; Supplemental; Instant; Mute): The Abyssal ignores up to (higher of Essence or 3) points of penalties on a Stealth roll.
# Caste Abilities
Walking unseen among the living in pursuit of their prey, Day Castes choose Caste Abilities from Athletics, Awareness, Investigation, Dodge, Larceny, Socialize, Stealth, and Survival.
#### ^Note:
The [[Martial Arts]] Ability cannot be chosen as Caste or Favored—instead, any character with [[Brawl]] as a chosen Caste or Favored Ability treats [[Martial Arts]] as Caste or Favored as well. A player may choose [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] as her [[Dawn]] Caste character’s Supernal Ability, but applies the benefits of that choice only to one or the other. Also, characters with [[Martial Arts]] dots must possess the [[Martial Artist]] Merit.
