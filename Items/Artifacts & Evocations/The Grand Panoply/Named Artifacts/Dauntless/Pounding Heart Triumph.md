*Those who risk nothing gain nothing in return, while those who risk everything win the chance to prove it was all worth it.*
With this Evocation the Exalt can push past her normal limits by drawing strength from Dauntless’ innate encouragement. If activated while the Exalt is in crash, the cost simply drops her [[Initiative]] further into the negative. The armor’s soak is reduced by three points, but gains one non-Charm success on a withering attack made with Melee, [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] for the rest of the scene. In addition, successfully gaining the upper hand over her opponent reinforces the Exalt’s confidence and drive to press her advantage as far as possible. Each time she successfully hits a target with a withering attack made with [[Melee]], [[Brawl]] or Martial Arts, she may increase the armor’s soak by 1. The armor’s soak cannot be increased past its soak value. 

## Special activation rules

Rather than being bought with experience, [[Pounding Heart Triumph]] is unlocked when the Solar defeats an opponent or battlegroup that represents a Major or Defining threat.
