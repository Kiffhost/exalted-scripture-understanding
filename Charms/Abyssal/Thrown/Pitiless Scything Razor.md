*As the deathknight’s foes succumb to doubt and paranoia, she delivers a killing blow that seems to come from nowhere.*
When an enemy fails his roll opposing Knives Between Friends, the Abyssal can use this Charm to reflexively make a decisive ambush against him (Exalted, p. 203).
She can only attack once, even if multiple enemies fail.
This doesn’t break her concealment if she attacks from stealth.
