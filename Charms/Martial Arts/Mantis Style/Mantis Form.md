*The stylist adopts the signature stance of the mantis, shifting her weight onto her rear leg as she extends her front leg forward, her hands outstretched to block and strike.*
She gains +1 Parry. If she attempts to block an attack but is hit by it, she adds (Parry) natural soak against withering damage or gains Hardness (Parry/2, rounded up) against decisive damage. Against enemies with lower Initiative or that sheâ€™s grappling, she doubles 10s on decisive damage rolls. 
## Special activation rules
When the stylist wins control of a clinch against a nontrivial enemy, she may reflexively enter Mantis Form.
