There are no certainties in the company of tricksters. The Lunar makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [Presence or Socialize]) instill roll with (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) bonus dice. Success causes targets to doubt the truth of a specific fact. A traveler waiting on a companion might question whether he’s at the correct teahouse; a merchant might second-guess his cargo’s value; a pickpocket’s victim might doubt whether he had the stolen item with him all along. This uncertainty can be leveraged as though it were a Major [[Intimacy]] for the scene. Characters presented with direct evidence of the fact’s truth may resist this influence without spending [[Willpower]]. A character with an [[Intimacy]] encompassing belief in the fact in question treats this influence as unacceptable: a soldier with a Tie of loyalty toward his commander might question whether he heard her orders correctly, but not whether he serves her.
