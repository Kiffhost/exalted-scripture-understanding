Through use of this Charm the Solar broadcasts her ability to evaluate and fence any good, and to estimate the viability of any good or service in any market. This Charm makes characters naturally assume the Solar is a master merchant, someone who should be approached in order to receive the best deal or gain information about any certain product. This Charm does not confer knowledge of any good the Solar is unfamiliar with, but it does allow her to reflexively employ [[Insightful Buyer Technique]] for one mote, in order to speculate on the value of goods in local or foreign markets, even those that may not be physically present.
