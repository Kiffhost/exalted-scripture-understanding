Salt is precious to the Realm. It’s a dietary necessity, a staple preservative, and bars passage to hungry ghosts. But the Blessed Isle’s salt gods — hundreds of whom dwell along coasts and marshes, and in salt mines — are truculent, demanding sizable sacrifices from any who’d gather significant quantities of salt. Centuries ago, the Empress compelled the salt gods to accept a single rate of sacrifice: the salt rate, then equivalent to two percent of the salt’s value. 

The Empress pinned the loan rates of all banks in the Realm to the salt rate by decree. She often changed the rate, either as a result of negotiations with salt gods or to manage the economy. It was four percent when she disappeared. Over the last five years, about half of the salt gods have diverged from the salt rate. Some have increased their demands, and regional banks and ministerial branches have felt it best to follow suit. In other instances where banks have raised rates, greedy salt gods have eagerly followed. In both cases, it’s peasants and debtors who suffer.
