A rippling haze of emerald-and-scarlet [[Essence]] roils around Spring Razor’s edge as the wielder slashes at her foes. On a successful attack, this nimbus of power intensifies the effects of any poison currently afflicting its target: the poison increases both its damage and duration by +1 until the toxin has run its course. Multiple uses of this Evocation stack—thus, three attacks with VenomIntensifying Stroke would extend the duration of a poison by 3 rounds, and increase its damage by +3.
