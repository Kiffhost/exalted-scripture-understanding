The Dragon-Blood strikes away temptations and madness born of the Wyld with a mudra of revelation, restoring the harmony of reality. She may free a character within short range of any Psyche effect or Derangement imposed by a creature of the Wyld or exposure to the Wyld itself, including Wyld addiction. The Exalt rolls ([Intelligence or Wits] + Occult) against the Resolve of the character she treats, but (the Essence of the creature that used that magic) is added to his Resolve. A successful roll terminates unnatural influence or removes a Derangement. On a failed roll, the Dragon-Blood cannot use this Charm to treat that character for the same affliction again for the rest of the story. This Charm can only be used once per day.
