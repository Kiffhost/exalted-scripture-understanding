Bearing the iconic panoply of the Chosen, the Sidereal binds her treasures to her. While the Sidereal has one full-cost attunement to an artifact weapon, she reduces the attunement cost of further artifact weapons by three motes each. This doesn’t stack with other discounts. If she ends her full-cost attunement, she must commit enough motes to bring another attunement to its full cost, or else all discounted attunements end.
