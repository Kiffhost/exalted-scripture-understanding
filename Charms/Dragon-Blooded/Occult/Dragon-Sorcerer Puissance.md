The Dragon-Blood’s elemental Essence overflows into her sorcery. Whenever she shapes a spell based on a single element, such as Flight of the Brilliant Raptor, Invulnerable Skin of Bronze, or Wood Dragon’s Claw, she gains a single additional sorcerous mote each round she spends shaping it. If the Dragon-Blooded is in the Aura state that matches the spell’s element, she gains three sorcerous motes each round instead.
