*The Solar is a master of stealth deception, capable of defeating each of the five senses.*
This Charm represents the Solar’s mastery of stealth by subtracting 2 successes for every 1 rolled in any [[Perception]]- or [[Awareness]]-based attempt to spot her. This penalty does not stack with the penalized 1s affected by [[Ten Whispers Silence Meditation]].
