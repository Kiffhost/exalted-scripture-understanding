*The Infernal wears down the impurities of corruption, scraping them away until perfection is attained.*

The Infernal doubles 9s on a bargain, persuade, or threaten roll to convince a god to perform its official duties in the Celestial Bureaucracy or a First Circle demon to perform the function for which it was made. She can use it against Second and Third Circle demons when convincing them to undertake tasks that fit the aspect of their Yozi that they express.

Targets can’t use Intimacies based on corruption, laziness, or ethics to bolster their Resolve or in a Decision Points, nor can they use negative Ties to demons, Yozis, or the Infernal.

With Essence 2, the Infernal can use this Charm against any character when convincing him to perform the official duties of a job or position he holds.
