*As heir to all the fiefdoms of reality, the Infernal reclaims her rightful dominion with a blasphemous proclamation.*

The Infernal desecrates the land around her out to medium range. She might evoke the Endless Desert, turning soil to silvery sand, or inflict other transformations reflecting Hell’s desolation. Plant life quickly withers and dies, while animals depart the desecrated area and avoid it unless they’re adapted for life in similarly inhospitable conditions. Heavy buildings may suffer some structural damage at the Storyteller’s discretion as they sink into sand or the like. The desecrated land is harsh terrain for Charms like [[Transcendent Desert Creature]]. It acts as a beachhead of Hell, and the Infernal waives [[Hell-Walker Technique]]’s Willpower cost within. If she uses it in the Wyld, the desecrated region obeys the natural laws of Hell (which, for this purpose, largely mirror Creation’s).

The Infernal’s [[Cult]] can spread the desecration by praying for within the region for at least five hours a day. It expands one mile outward in every direction over the course of a 420-day year, up to a maximum of (Essence) miles. If the cultists’ numbers are equivalent to a Size 3+ battle group, the time needed is divided by (Size/2, rounded up). It can also be expanded through the ritual executions of supernatural beings at its centre. Each counts as (victim’s Essence x 5) days, or (victim’s Essence x 25) for celestial gods and Exalted.

The desecration can be cleaned with a sorcerous working, magic like [[Benediction of Archgenesis]] (Exalted, p. 480), or other mystical means that intrepid characters might discover. Killing the Infernal also cleanses it.
