*Bloody cuts open across the Sidereal’s hands as she pulls at fate’s weave with terrible might, tearing forth a possible disaster to inflict against the world.*
The Sidereal makes a feat of demolition from afar against a structure, terrain feature, or large object that she can perceive within (Essence) miles, although she doesn’t roll immediately. Manses and other magical structures can’t be targeted. The Sidereal adds (Essence) to her effective Strength to determine if she can attempt the feat of strength, plus an additional +1 for each dot of bonus Strength she has from Burn Life.
If successful, the target isn’t destroyed immediately, but its end is set in motion. Over the course of an hour, synchronicities and coincidence build into a catastrophe that will befall the target. During this time, the Sidereal can’t move from her location, steadily pulling at the threads of fate. If she does move, this Charm ends prematurely, and the calamity is averted. The same occurs if she ends this Charm before the calamity ensues or if she’s incapacitated.
The first signs of the coming calamity are omens and portents, which appear throughout this Charm’s range.
Interpreting them requires a difficulty 1 ({Intelligence or Perception} + Occult) roll to realize that some form of supernatural calamity is coming. With 2+ extra successes, the calamity’s target is revealed. With 4+ extra successes, the Sidereal’s current location is revealed as the magic’s source, along with the approximate distance and direction.
After an hour, if the Sidereal hasn’t been stopped, she rolls the feat of demolition, unleashing a catastrophe against her target: an earthquake, a hurricane, a falling meteor. A successful roll reduces the target to ruins or rubble, while even a failed roll causes enough damage to provide a meaningful advantage. If she can’t smash down a castle’s walls, she might still breach them and create a usable opening.
The Sidereal’s player chooses what form the catastrophe takes, but it should be proportionate to the damage inflicted — she can’t create a volcanic eruption to wipe out a peasant’s hovel. Any destruction caused by the catastrophe is limited to the targeted structure. No matter how badly a targeted structure is damaged, any nontrivial characters inside it should receive a roll to escape unharmed. The Storyteller decides how trivial characters are affected.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) with a feat of strength or by inflicting destruction on a large scale.
