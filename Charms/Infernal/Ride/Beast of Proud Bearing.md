*The Infernal’s steed rears its head, which blazes with a crown of hellfire, and seems to grow larger than life.*

When the Infernal Joins Battle, her mount also gains an amount of Initiative equal to her own. It acts on its own Initiative and can attack without using the Infernal’s attack action for the round. A crown of emerald flame surrounds its head, marking it as a beast of hellish power and adding two dice on its threaten rolls.

Using this Charm gives the Infernal’s mount a Minor Tie of superiority toward other animals — or, if her mount is a demon, to (other) First Circle demons. If it already has such a Tie, it’s strengthened by one step instead.
