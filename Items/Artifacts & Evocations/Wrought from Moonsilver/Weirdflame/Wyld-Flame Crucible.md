Unleashing a conflagration of morphic fire, Weirdflame’s master twists her foe in a gruesome display of power. She makes a difficulty 5 gambit, inflicting one of the following transformations for one day if successful: 
- Humanity-Immolating Pyre: Twisted into a gruesome and terrifying shape, the victim inspires fear in all who behold him. He gains the Hideous Merit and suffers a −2 penalty on inspire and instill rolls based on any emotion but fear, and bargain and persuade rolls. Anyone who sees him assumes he’s a demon, fae, or similar horror unless they succeed on a difficulty 3 (Perception + Occult) roll. Characters who know him add +3 dice on this roll; on a failure, they assume he’s a monster that’s somehow stolen the original’s shape. 
- Limb-Twisting Molt: One of the victim’s limbs or organs is grotesquely transformed — a leg turned to coral, an arm stripped of bones, eyes becoming fungal growths, etc. — inflicting a −3 penalty on rolls requiring its use. 
- Melting Face Curse: Weirdflame’s fire burns away the victim’s face and identifying features. Recognizing him by sight, scent, or voice is impossible without magic, and even then requires a (Perception + Awareness) roll at difficulty (wielder’s Manipulation + Essence). This can’t disguise him as another individual. This is a shaping effect (p. XX). The wielder can stack multiple gambits on a single foe but can’t stack the same gambit — with the exception of Limb-Twisting Molt, which can be applied once per body part. Weirdflame’s master can develop new transformations of comparable power for three experience points (or one bonus point) each.

The wielder makes a damaging decisive attack instead. As long as the damage inflicted beats the gambit’s difficulty, she may forgo three levels of damage to inflict a single transformation.
