This Evocation turns a sorcerous foe’s tools against him, using them as the vehicle for burning vengeance. When the Exalt incapacitates an enemy with a baneful attack, she may use this Evocation to knock his body back one or two range bands, where veins of burning Solar Essence spread through it until it explodes in a ball of golden fire. This is a decisive attack, rolled with (Intelligence + Occult) against all enemies within close range of the body. It has raw damage equal to the total number of health levels the detonated enemy lost on the killing strike, ignoring Hardness.
