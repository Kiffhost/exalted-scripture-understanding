*The air flickers with hadal darkness and insurmountable pressure as the wielder slams [[Sea’s Verdict]] to the ground, fraying the chains on its power.*
[[Gaol Without Fathom]] can only be used while Sea’s Verdict’s anima is burning or higher. The wielder rolls a decisive attack against every opponent at close range, but doesn’t roll damage normally. She may pay two [[Initiative]] for each enemy hit to knock them prone and grapple them without needing a gambit, pinning them beneath spiritual pressure like that of the ocean depths. This cost is waived against prone enemies. Each victim rolls for control separately, comparing their results to the wielder’s original attack roll. The wielder can only restrain her victims, who are slammed prone and rendered mute, deaf, and blind (Exalted, pp. 168) while grappled, as a lightless silence presses against them. While [[Sea’s Verdict]] is at bonfire, the restrain action costs only one turn of control. The wielder doesn’t lose rounds of control for being attacked or damaged, but a grappled enemy may attempt to struggle free as his action for a round, which can’t be placed in a flurry, removing two rounds of control.
