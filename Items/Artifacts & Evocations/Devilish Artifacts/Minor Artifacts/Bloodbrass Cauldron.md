A large ruddy-brass vessel inscribed with Old Realm glyphs in tarnished orichalcum, the Bloodbrass Cauldron dates back to the early First Age, when sorcerer-warlords vied for supremacy at the fringes of the Exalted host. It can be used to brew a tainted elixir from a combination of human and demon blood, certain rare mushrooms, acrid alchemical salts, and a small sample of Hegra’s rage-rains. (In Hell, these can all be acquired with a single Resources ••• expenditure).

The cauldron’s master must spend fifteen motes to catalyse the mixture. After six hours of brewing, the Bloodbrass Cauldron produces a foul, deep red brew, sufficient for a few dozen individuals or a Size 2 battle group. A demon or human who drinks from the cauldron experiences a monstrous transformation over the course of a minute, gaining the following for one day:
- They become [[Creatures of Darkness]].
- They gain the [[Hideous]] Merit and six dots of mutations. They’re based on the demon whose blood was used, like spikes and fur for a blood ape or jewelled chitin and wings for an agata. The mutations are the same for all who drink it.
- They gain an additional −4 health level.
- They gain a Minor Principle of “I must rage against Creation.” It can’t be weakened or altered by any means for the transformation’s duration.
- They’re filled with energy and have no need to sleep. They gain +2 Resolve against effects that compel sleep or unconsciousness.
- Battle groups of transformed characters have Might 1.

After the transformation reverts, some vestiges remain. Affected characters are still [[Hideous]] and [[Creatures of Darkness]], and may retain cosmetic alterations similar to the mutations. They also retain the imposed Intimacy, though it can be weakened normally.

Characters who drink from the Cauldron more than once per season must make a difficulty 3 (Stamina + Resistance) at difficulty 3 or become addicted to its brew.
