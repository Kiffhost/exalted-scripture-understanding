The wounds left by [[Fond Remembrance]] are nothing compared to the damage of one’s past.
The Lunar gains the benefits of [[Nightmare Scar Memento]] (Lunars, pp. 270-271) against characters with false memories. False memories created with [[All Your Yesterdays]] are severe enough to impose Major Ties of fear. The Lunar may suppress this or resume it reflexively.
