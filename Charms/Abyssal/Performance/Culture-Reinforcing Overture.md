*Death’s Lawgiver subtly weaves appreciation for the proper forms of society into her performance.*
When the Abyssal makes an inspire or instill roll, it also counts as a roll to instill a positive Tie toward a culture or society or a Principle involving a tradition, cultural practice, philosophical movement, or the like.
Her performance must reflect the Intimacy instilled.
This fails if the target has a Major or Defining Intimacy that directly opposes the instilled Intimacy.
If the Abyssal instills a Tie to a culture that’s now dead or that consists primarily of the undead, her target is immune only if he has an opposed Defining Tie. She also gains this benefit when instilling a Principle involving a custom or belief related to death or from a culture that’s either dead or undead.
