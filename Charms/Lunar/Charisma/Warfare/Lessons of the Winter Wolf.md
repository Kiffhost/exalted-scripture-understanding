*The Lunar’s harsh training flenses fear from her warriors.*
She spends at least an hour training a battle group of up to [[Size]] ({Charisma or Stamina} − 1), or [[Size]] ([[Charisma]] or [[Stamina]]) if it has [[Might]]. The next time that battle group fights it gains +2 [[Resolve]], doubles 9s on rout checks, and ignores up to ([[Essence]]) points of penalty from deprivation and fatigue. It can benefit from a [[Rally for numbers]] action made by the Lunar an additional time that scene. These benefits only last for one battle, and are lost if not used within a week. Only one battle group may enjoy this Charm’s benefits at a time. 

## Special activation rules

When the Lunar uses WolfPack Training Technique, she may use this Charm reflexively, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost, to confer its benefits on the trained group until the story’s end. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Berserker may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm, with [[Undaunted Berserker Ire]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
