The Sidereal weaves together the fates of those who fight alongside each other, letting each soldier’s confidence in his training bolster that of his comrades. The Sidereal spends an hour training a battle group of up to Size (Intelligence). In its next battle, it gains −1 target number on Join Battle rolls, rout checks, and damage rolls against enemies of fate and crashed foes. This last one battle and is lost if not used within a week. Only one battle group can benefit at a time. 

## Special activation rules

When the Sidereal uses Training Mandate of Celestial Empowerment, she can use this Charm reflexively, waiving its Willpower cost, to confer its benefits on the trained group until the story’s end.
