*The necromancer unleashes a cascade of purple lightning from her palm, striking nearby corpses. With an unearthly spasm, the moaning dead rise to their feet.*
The necromancer rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) against difficulty 1. Success animates a [[Size]] 1 battle group of zombies with poor [[Drill]] and [[Might]] 1. The necromancer may improve its [[Size]] by spending three extra successes per additional dot of [[Size]], maximum [[Size]] (necromancer’s [[Essence]]). To reanimate larger numbers, she must cast the spell repeatedly. This spell requires sufficient corpses to reanimate. Nearly a dozen are necessary to raise a [[Size]] 1 battle group, larger numbers require a mass of corpses as can be found on a battlefield, a graveyard, or similar site. Zombies persist indefinitely and possess a Defining Tie of obedience to the necromancer that cannot be weakened.
## Control
The necromancer may raise a [[Size]] 1 battle group of zombies without nearby corpses, calling ancient dead from the ground beneath her feet. Battle groups of reanimated zombies under her command possess average [[Drill]]. Wherever the necromancer goes, corpses begin to groan and shift where they lie, their final rest disturbed by her passing.
## Distortion (15)
Distortion weakens the strength of the necromancer’s bindings. She rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) against a difficulty of (battle group’s [[Size]] + 1). Failure causes the battle group to lose a point of [[Size]] and restore all Magnitude. If the battle group is [[Size]] 1, it instead suffers five levels of damage to Magnitude.
