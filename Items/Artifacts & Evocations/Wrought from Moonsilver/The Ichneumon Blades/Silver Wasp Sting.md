The Ichneumon Blades fracture as they plunge into flesh, leaving their sharp-edged brood growing in their victim’s wounds. A decisive attack that deals 3+ damage embeds a splinter in the wound, raising the victim’s wound penalty by one. If the wielder makes a piercing attack, it ignores (Dexterity) Hardness. Up to (higher of Essence or 3, maximum 5) splinters can be embedded in a victim, stacking their penalty increase. The increased penalty lasts until the embedded splinter is surgically removed, requiring a difficulty 3 (Intelligence + Medicine) roll that takes one hour, and inflicts an unavoidable level of lethal damage on the patient even if successful. If a victim suffers from multiple splinters, each must be removed separately.
