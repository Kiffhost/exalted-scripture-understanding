*No mere darkness dares hinder Death’s Lawgiver.*
The Abyssal ignores penalties from poor lighting and darkness on vision-based Perception rolls with any Ability.
While using Superior Sight Focus, when the deathknight Joins Battle while in poor lighting, she adds bonus dice equal to the penalty these conditions inflict on other characters’ rolls.
