*“But then Itreyoun will fade, at once false and all too real, the way things appear in our dreams as we are waking.”*

This Evocation can only be used while Remembrance of the Miracle is active, and ends that Evocation. As the image of Itreyoun fades, part of the world fades with it. The wearer can cause any number of unattended mundane objects within long range to fade from reality, as well as portions of mundane structures within range: huts and hovels vanish, holes to appear in fortress walls, storied artworks fade away, and so on.

The wearer can likewise banish environmental phenomena that would last no more than a day otherwise. This includes even phenomena created by magic, like flames ignited by Flight of the Brilliant Raptor. She can also end any deleterious magic she suffers if it would last no more than a day normally.

If a character within long range has an Obsession inflicted by Tale-Teller’s Fading Memorial and no remaining temporary Willpower, he must make a Willpower roll against his Obsession (Exalted, p. 169). If he fails, he discovers the nature and fate of Itreyoun, and he too is gone.
### Resonant
Only characters resonant with the Mourning of Itreyoun can awaken this Evocation.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by maintaining a Defining Intimacy of fascination or obsession with Itreyoun — or a Defining Obsession — for a full month.
