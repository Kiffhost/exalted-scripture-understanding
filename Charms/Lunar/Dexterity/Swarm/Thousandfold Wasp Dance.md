*Emerald Grasshopper Form The Lunar’s innards roil and churn as she gathers all her aggression, frustration, and stress, manifesting them as a cloud of vermin.*
She disgorges a swarm of a Minuscule [[Size]] animal whose shape she possesses, which flies or scurries to a location within medium range. This swarm is a difficulty ([[Dexterity]] or [[Wits]]), Damage ([[Essence]], maximum 5)L/round environmental hazard that affects all characters — friend or foe — within short range of its center. Other characters moving through the swarm must spend one [[Initiative]] per round, as though it were a battle group. On her turn, the Lunar may reflexively move the swarm one range band in any direction as her move action. An enemy with appropriate weaponry, like a firewand, can disperse the swarm with a difficulty 7 gambit. Even if he fails the [[Initiative]] roll, reduce the difficulty of subsequent gambits by his successes. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Minuscule [[Size]] may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm.
