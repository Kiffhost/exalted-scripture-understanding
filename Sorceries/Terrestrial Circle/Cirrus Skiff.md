*The sorcerer calls down a [[Cirrus Skiff]] to bear her skyward, a small white puffy cloud just large enough for her and one other passenger to ride upon.*
The cloud descends from the sky and hovers near the sorcerer like a faithful puppy until she steps on, at which point it rises into the air, obeying her mental commands. It is slow-moving, managing a pace of only ([[Essence]] x 6) miles per hour, but is virtually unlimited in its flight capability, able to rise upward with no limit other than the ability of its caster to endure the rarefied air of the upper atmosphere. In combat, the sorcerer rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) in place of standard movement rolls to mentally direct the cloud, but otherwise faces no complications or penalties. If the sorcerer wishes to sleep, study, or otherwise rest on the [[Cirrus Skiff]] without having to give it constant instructions, she may give it a set command, such as “Fly a mile up into the air and stay there” or “Circle around the satrap’s palace,” which it will obey until she gives it new orders. The sorcerer may disembark from the skiff for up to one scene without ending this spell, but any absence beyond that ends the spell, sending the cloud flying back up into the stratosphere. 

A character who knows [[Cirrus Skiff]] as her control spell may cast it with an Indefinite duration. Her conjured cloud will follow after her after she disembarks, eagerly awaiting her return without ever leaving. It will follow simple instructions from the sorcerer, even when she’s not riding it, and can be summoned by the sorcerer’s call from anywhere in Creation, proceeding to her side at the best speed it can manage.
