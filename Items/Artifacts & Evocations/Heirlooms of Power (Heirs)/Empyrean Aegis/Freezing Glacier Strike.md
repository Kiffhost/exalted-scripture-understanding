Empyrean Aegis strikes with numbing cold. It gains +1 Overwhelming on a withering attack or ignores 2 Hardness from metal armor on a decisive attack. If it deals 5+ withering damage or 1+ decisive damage, ice rimes her target. Until the wielder’s next turn, that character can’t attack her or any ally protected by her defend other actions unless he first pays 2 Initiative.
