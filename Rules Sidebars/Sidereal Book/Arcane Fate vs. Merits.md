[[Arcane fate]] can easily interfere with [[Merits]] like [[Allies]], [[Mentor]], and [[Retainers]]. The Storyteller should be generous in granting bonus die on such character’s rolls against it and in giving them opportunities to roll to recover lost memories. If [[arcane fate]] causes such a relationship to deteriorate to the point that the Sidereal’s player is no longer interested in trying to maintain it, the Storyteller should refund the Merit’s experience point cost.
