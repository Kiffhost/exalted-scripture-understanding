The Sidereal leaves herself wide open, letting the momentum of a foe’s attack drive him into her clutches. The Sidereal may reduce her [[Defense]] against an attack by any amount, counterattacking with a damaging decisive attack or a grapple gambit. Each point she reduces her [[Defense]] by adds a success to the attack, [[Initiative]], and grapple control rolls and reduces the gambit’s [[Initiative]] cost by one.
