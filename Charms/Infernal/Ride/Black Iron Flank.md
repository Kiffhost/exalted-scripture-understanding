*Scales of iron ripple across the flanks of the Infernal’s mount, bolstering the beast against any assault on it or its rider.*

When the Infernal rides a mount, withering attacks against it suffer −1 Overwhelming, while decisive attacks subtract (Infernal’s Essence) dice of damage. It can pay one Initiative to reflexively protect the Infernal with a defend other action. If an enemy diverts an attack against the Infernal to the mount because of this, this Charm’s penalties are both increased by one against it.

While using [[Viridian Legend Exoskeleton#Brazen Hell-Chariot Carapace|Viridian Legend Exoskeleton (Brazen Hell-Chariot Carapace)]], this Charm’s penalties are both increased by an additional point.
