Extending her hand, the Solar may summon her weapon with but a thought. This Charm can reach a weapon within short range. Roll ([[Wits]] + [[Melee]]) at difficulty 4. On a success, the weapon flashes to hand instantly, without traversing the space between. On a failure, the weapon leaps to the Solar’s hand, overcoming friction and gravity to do so. However, it is unable to defeat doors, chains, or other similar obstacles, and even if the path is unobstructed, the weapon does not return until the Solar’s next turn. The Exalt cannot use this power to steal weapons, only to call her own weapon to hand.
