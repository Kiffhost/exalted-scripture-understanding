*Gazing skyward as she makes the Lesser Sign of the Ship’s Wheel, the Sidereal shapes the skies to create or remove obstacles.*
The Sidereal rolls (Stamina + Survival) to change the local weather. The difficulty of the roll depends on how drastic a change she wishes to make: creating a light rain or mist or creating or stilling light winds is difficulty 1; strengthening heavy rain to a thunderstorm or dissipating a storm might be difficulty 2-3. Creating a blizzard or thunderstorm out of nowhere or diminishing a hurricane to a severe storm is difficulty 5+. If successful, the Sidereal’s changes take place over a matter of minutes or hours, depending on how extensive they are. The weather can extend up to (Stamina + extra successes) miles from where the Sidereal uses it. It lasts until at least the end of this Charm’s duration.
The Sidereal may suffer a penalty for creating unseasonable weather or weather that doesn’t naturally occur in that region. She can’t create extreme natural disasters like hurricanes, tsunamis, or tornadoes unless local conditions are already such that it’s likely that one could form naturally; such rolls are at difficulty 6+.
While using Becoming the Wilderness, the Sidereal’s immune to any weather she creates with this Charm.
