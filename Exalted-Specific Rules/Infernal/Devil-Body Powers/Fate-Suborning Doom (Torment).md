The Infernal’s dark magic seizes and tangles the threads of fate around her victim, inflicting a fate-altering Shaping effect: condemning him to never be granted hospitality, to die at the hands of those he trusts most under the new moon, to be hunted by a thousand dread beasts come Calibration. The Infernal chooses an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) pool and a specific curse. The effect otherwise functions like [[Body-Warping Blight (Torment)|Body-Warping Blight]].
