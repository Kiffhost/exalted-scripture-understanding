*It is not the place of the universe to dictate the Infernal’s identity.*

[[Ego-Infused Pattern Primacy]] defends the Infernal against a Shaping effect. She adds dice equal to her current temporary Willpower on an opposed roll or (current temporary Willpower/2, rounded up) to a static value, regardless of what Ability she uses.

If the Shaping would change the Infernal in a way that would undermine the sense of self expressed in one of her Intimacies, or hinder her ability to uphold that Intimacy, she adds an additional (Intimacy) dice, or (Intimacy/2, rounded up) to a static value.

Even if the Infernal fails, she can pay one Willpower to mitigate the consequences. The Shaping can’t kill her, leave her unable to take actions, or completely prevent or from using Charms or other magic — at least, not immediately. The Storyteller can weaken or alter such effects, or can have the effect develop progressively over the course of seasons, or even years. If the Shaping is normally permanent, it becomes possible for the Infernal to break it, though it’s up to her to figure out how — often with the use of Lore, Medicine, or Occult.
