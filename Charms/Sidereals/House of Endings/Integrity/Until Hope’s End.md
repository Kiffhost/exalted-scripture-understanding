All hopes must end, but until they do, the Sidereals clings fiercely to hers. The Sidereal gains the following: 
-  Her hopeful [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] increase their [[Resolve]] bonus by one. 
-  Once per day, she can lower the [[Willpower]] cost to resist an inspire roll to create despair by one. 
-  While acting in accordance with a hopeful [[Intimacy]], she adds ([[Intimacy]]) to her [[Stamina]] to determine how long she can go without food, air, and water. 
-  If a hope expressed by one of her Intimacies is decisively thawarted, it counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX). Hopeful [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] Hopeful Intimacies express a character’s hopes, dreams, and desires for the future, even if they aren’t explicitly worded as hopes: a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of great expectations for one’s child, a [[Intimacy|Principle]] of commitment to a long-term agenda, a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the object of one’s affections, etc.
