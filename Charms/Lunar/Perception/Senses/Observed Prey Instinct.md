*The Lunar’s predatory nature provides an uncanny intuition for when she risks becoming prey.*
She rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) opposing the attack roll of an unexpected attack (Exalted, p. 203). Success removes a surprise attack’s [[Defense]] penalty. Against ambushes, success instead lets her defend normally, but sets her [[Defense]] to 1, plus one for every two threshold successes, up to a maximum of her normal base [[Defense]]. 
## Totemic 

If the Lunar’s spirit shape is a prey animal with Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]], she may learn this as a [[Dexterity]] Charm, with Agile Beast [[Defense]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
