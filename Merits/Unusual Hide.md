One of the most common mutations bestowed by the Wyld, this Merit grants an unusually resilient hide of some sort.
The character gains additional points of natural soak equal to the Merit’s value. One or two dots generally represents fur, feathers, leaves, or light scales. Three dots indicate flesh far beyond the human norm—the leathery hide of a rhino or crocodile, or the exoskeletal carapace of an insect, perhaps. Four or five dots grant an armored hide which may be made of bony armor, an obsidian carapace, or perhaps even a body of living stone.
### Drawback
The character obviously looks like a Wyld mutant, with all the stigma that accompanies such status, and suffers a penalty equal to her rating in this Merit on all disguise rolls to pass for normal.
