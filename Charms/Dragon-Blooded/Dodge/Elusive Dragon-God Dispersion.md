The Dragon-Blood unleashes a seething furor of elemental Essence in her wake, forcing her enemies to plunge through flames, brambles, storms, and all Creation’s fury in pursuit of her. She may use Unassailable Body of Fire while in any Elemental Aura, changing the aspects of that Charm and Hopping Firecracker Evasion to match her Aura and enhancing her counterattack based on its element. Air: The Dragon-Blood dissolves into gusting wind. As long as she deals any damage, she may force the enemy to move one range band horizontally in any direction. Earth: The Dragon-Blood counterattacks with a blast of sand, sediment, or dust, adding one bonus success to the damage roll. On a successful attack, this either knocks her enemy prone or blinds him (Exalted, p. 168) until he spends his whole turn clearing his eyes. Fire: The Dragon-Blood doubles 10s on the decisive damage roll. Water: The Dragon-Blood becomes a torrent of water in motion, knocking her enemy off balance. The counterattack deals bashing damage, and if it hits, her attacker takes a −3 penalty on all physical rolls for his next three turns. Wood: The Dragon-Blood counterattacks with tangling brambles that deal no damage, but instead grapple her attacker on a hit without need for an Initiative roll. The brambles use the Dragon-Blood’s (Stamina + Dodge) to establish control of the grapple, and can only take restrain actions. The Dragon-Blood can act normally while the brambles maintain the clinch.
