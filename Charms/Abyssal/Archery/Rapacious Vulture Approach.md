*The deathknight’s hungry gaze sights new prey as she flits from shadow to shadow, her every move a prelude to murder.*
The Abyssal can take a [[move]] action and [[aim]] on the same turn, and can [[flurry]] an [[aim]] with a [[rush]] or [[disengage]].
If the Abyssal moves toward a foe and uses [[Pulse of the Prey]] against him on the same turn, she waives that Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost.
