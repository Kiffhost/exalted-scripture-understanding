Though few records speak of it today, there once stood a forge-manse called Skyfire, built upon the peak of the highest mountain in the West. Its master, the artisan Shan Irrak of the Golden Forge, was renowned among those who worked orichalcum. In time, he fell in love with a predator-spirit of the skies named Red Wing, and forged a magnificent weapon in her honor: a powerbow carved in the likeness of a hawk, with perfect rubies for eyes, glittering orichalcum claws, and flawlessly carved and polished wings. It was a weapon of devotion, and a pure expression of the aerial predator. He made Hunting Hawk a gift of his love, but that love survived the ages no more than did Shan Irrak or his fantastic manse. Red Wing was torn asunder when the Fair Folk invaded Creation, and the magnificent bow fell from the pages of history, lost in the tumult of the Wyld Crusade. Orichalcum Hunting Hawk possesses a single hearthstone socket on its ‘back,’ where its wings meet. 

## Evocations of Hunting Hawk 

A Solar who attunes to Orichalcum Hunting Hawk may close his eyes and see with the glittering cut-ruby clarity of the bow, piercing through all earthly haze and distraction. Any attack made with the bow which benefits from an aim bonus ignores all penalties due to poor visibility—up to and including being able to instinctively sight and target in pitch blackness, or when blind.
