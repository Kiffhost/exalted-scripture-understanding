*A connoisseur of death, the Abyssal diagnoses mortal frailties with inevitable certainty.*
When the Abyssal rolls to diagnose a patient, she succeeds automatically. For diseases or poisons she has no prior knowledge of, she discerns only the general category of disease or poison they belong to and whether or not they’re supernatural.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can use this Charm to add +2 [[Resolve]] against any influence roll that questions or opposes a medical judgment she’s made after diagnosing or triaging patients.
