*Death’s Lawgiver pronounces her enemies’ failure with infallible foresight, crushing the hopes of those who fail to heed her.*
The Abyssal can pay an eight-mote surcharge when she uses [[Bleak Wisdom Malison]] to apply its penalties not just to her target, but everyone who takes part in the affected plan or agenda. (She doesn’t need to beat their [[Resolve]]). Additionally, that agenda will face at least one major narrative obstacle as a result of its fatal flaw. A warlord’s dreams of conquest might be stymied as crop blights leave her legions with empty stomachs, while a sorcerer’s working might draw vengeful shades of those slain by [[sorcery]] to him.
