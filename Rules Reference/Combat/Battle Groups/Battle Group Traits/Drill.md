While the traits of the average character making up a [[Battle Group]] determines the quality of the group overall, [[Drill]] measures how well the combatants within that group work together. In mass combat, [[Drill]] is one of the most important traits a group of fighters can have. It represents hours of training and familiarity—the ability to know what the soldier to the left or right of you will do at any given moment because you’ve been through these maneuvers with them countless times. Well-drilled units hold together better in the face of sudden catastrophe, respond more readily to orders, and are generally much more difficult to defeat than low-[[Drill]] units of greater [[Size]]. As a result, [[Drill]] modifies [[Rout]] rolls, provides modifiers to [[Rules Reference/Combat/Battle Groups/Command]], and enhances a unit’s [[Defense]]. In short, high-[[Drill]] battle groups are tougher to defeat, and respond better to commands.

There are three categories of [[Drill]]:
# Poor
Poor-quality battle groups inflict a -2 penalty to [[Order]] and [[Rally for numbers]] actions, do not modify their [[Defense]], and raise the difficulty of all rout and rally rolls by 1.

A unit with poor [[Drill]] has no training in fighting together, or no capability for such training. This is the [[Drill]] quality of rioting mobs, of impromptu peasant conscripts tossed directly into battle, of most village militias, of many bandits, of raiders who fight without any sort of coordination, of groups of experienced fighters brought together without any particular familiarity with fighting alongside one another, and of mindless undead.
# Average
Average-quality battle groups inflict no penalty to command rolls and enjoy a +1 [[Defense]] bonus.

A battle group with average [[Drill]] has some training fighting together, either in the field or through extensive training and practice. In a fight, they know what to do and they move with ease and precision. The majority of military forces in the world of Exalted have average quality [[Drill]]. This covers standing armies, common mercenary groups, well-trained guards, [[Guild]] caravan security, and the war-bred minions of the Fair Folk.
# Elite
Elite-quality battle groups add a +2 bonus to [[Rules Reference/Combat/Battle Groups/Command|command rolls]] and enjoy a +2 [[Defense]] bonus.

Elite [[Battle Group|battle groups]] have drilled extensively with one another, and have probably gone through a number of battles together. The members of the battle groups often eat, sleep, and relax together, and spend far more time honing their skills as a group than the average band of soldiers. As a result, these battle groups are often small, prestigious units or semi-religious orders. The Realm’s elite Imperial Guard, Harborhead’s Brides of Ahlat, the warrior-brotherhoods of Medo, and the very best mercenary companies employed by the [[Guild]] are all elite-quality battle groups.
