*Wraiths of smoke and spectral metal emerge from the deathknight’s outstretched hand, cast off to be her roving eyes.*
The Abyssal can create up to ([[Essence]]) wraiths, paying three motes each. The wraiths acts as an extension of her perception, allowing her to make [[Awareness]] rolls based on any sense as though she were in a wraith’s position. Additionally, she can ignore penalties on non-[[Awareness]] action from darkness, mist, or other sensory impediments if at least one wraith would not suffer them from its vantage. If [[Countless Grasping Phantoms]] is active, that Charm’s spectral sense of touch is also conveyed through the wraiths, extending its effect to encompass characters within short range of any wraith as well as the Abyssal.
The wraiths appear within close range of the Abyssal. On each of her turns, she can reflexively move a single wraith one range band, or use her movement action to reflexively move each wraith one range band. As dematerialized entities, they are capable of passing through walls and similar material obstructions. They can’t move beyond long range from her.
The wraiths are immaterial. Against magic capable of attacking dematerialized targets, they have [[Defense|Evasion]] (Abyssal’s [[Perception]]), and can be destroyed with a difficulty 3 gambit. They can’t be targeted by normal withering or decisive attacks. If the Abyssal conceals herself with a [[Stealth]] roll, the wraiths also receive the benefits of her roll against enemies capable of perceiving dematerialized targets.
The Abyssal may purchase the following upgrades for her wraiths for three experience points or one bonus point each:
[[Dauntless]]: The difficulty of gambits to destroy the wraiths increases to (Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + 3, maximum 6).
Eager: The cost of creating wraiths past the first is reduced by two motes.
Enduring: The Charm’s duration is extended to one day.
Far-Roving: The wraiths’ maximum range increases to ([[Perception]] + [[Essence]]) range bands.
Haunting: Rather than creating a stationary wraith, the Abyssal can create one that ceaselessly pursues an individual she can see, manifesting within close range of him and following him unfailingly out to its normal range limits.
Insightful: The Abyssal can make [[profile character]] and read intentions rolls through her wraiths.
Legion: The maximum number of wraiths is increased to ([[Perception]] + [[Essence]]).
The player may work with the [[Storyteller]] to create new upgrades.
