The Lunar’s legs change with every footfall, adapting to whatever landscape she traverses. She ignores the effects of non-magical difficult terrain on a single move action. Alternatively, she raises the difficulty of a gambit that would impede her movement, including grapple and unhorse gambits, by (Essence). 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Speed Bonuses, the Lunar also adds (Essence) dice on an enhanced move action, or raises a gambit’s difficulty by an additional point.
