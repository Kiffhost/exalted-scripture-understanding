*The Infernal brings bounty to the wastes, calling forth a swarm of iridescent demon-locusts like an obscene rainbow.*

The Infernal rolls ({Charisma or Wits} + Survival) to call a swarm of demon-locusts, which quiver for a moment before spasming and dying. If the Infernal uses this Charm to provide for her followers, she adds ([[Cult]]) non-Charm dice on the roll. The difficulty depends on the Infernal’s environs, with a higher difficulty for more abundant, hospitable regions.

The locusts provide enough food to feed (1 + extra successes) characters for a day, with a delectable taste that’s strangely nostalgic. They remain edible for a week, after which they dry up and crumble into sand. Candying the locusts or using similar preservation techniques can extend this up to a month.

Characters who eat a meal of locusts form a Minor Tie of reverence toward the Infernal unless they spend one Willpower. The Infernal gains a Tie of smug satisfaction toward herself instead. Once a character has spent (8 – Resolve) days eating nothing but locusts, he can’t voluntarily weaken this Tie until he’s gone the same amount of time without eating them.
