*The Abyssal master thief seizes every distraction to work her wickedness unseen.*
The Abyssal can use this after a Perception roll opposing her Larceny. 1s and 2s on opposing rolls subtract successes — not just on that roll, but on all rolls opposing the Abyssal’s Larceny. This includes rolls made at the same time by other characters. The penalty stacks up to a maximum of (higher of Essence or 3) successes.
