### Prerequisite: Lunar Exalt 

This Merit depicts a Lunar with several animal forms at character creation. One dot provides the shapes of around six relatively weak animals, comparable to one-dot Familiars (Exalted, p. 161), and two or three stronger animals, comparable to two-dot Familiars, from a single region.

Two dots provide the shapes of one to two dozen weaker animals, six stronger animals, and one or two extremely powerful animals, comparable to three-dot Familiars, from a single region.

Three dots provide the same benefits as two dots, plus the shapes of two to three additional stronger or extremely powerful animals.

For an additional dot, the Lunar can select animal forms from any number of regions.
