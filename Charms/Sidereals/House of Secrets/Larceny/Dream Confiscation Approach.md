*Bumping casually into someone, the Sidereal walks away with his dreams.*
The Sidereal touches a character and rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Larceny]]) against his [[Resolve]]. If successful, he loses one [[Willpower]] as she steals his dreams. He does not dream when he sleeps, rendering him immune to magic that would cause him to do so or manipulate his dreams, but he can’t recover [[Willpower]] from sleeping. The Sidereal learns one of the target’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] from examining his stolen dreams. Against fae, this Charm instead unravels the dream-like patterns of their [[Essence]], inflicting (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice of aggravated decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t include or reset the Sidereal’s [[Initiative]]. A damaged fae is inspired with overwhelming hunger and can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist. Such uses have instant duration.
