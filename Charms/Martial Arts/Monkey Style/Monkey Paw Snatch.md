*Striking an enemy’s weapon hand with a well-timed slap, the stylist relives him of his armaments.*
When the stylist flurries a disarm gambit with a ready weapon action to retrieve the disarmed weapon, the flurry penalty on the attack roll is reduced by one and her Defense isn’t penalized.
If successful, the stylist gains +3 non-Charm against that enemy’s disarm gambits against the same weapon until the end of his next turn.
