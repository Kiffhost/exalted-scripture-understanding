Swooping down from above, the wielder strikes with terribleeffect.Thewieldermovesdownoneverticalrangeband and horizontally up to two range bands. If this places her within close range of an opponent, she makes a nonranged decisive attack, adding (Strength) dice to the attack roll and doubling 10s on the damage roll. This counts as her movement action for the turn. This Evocation can only be used once per scene. The wearer can reset it by ending her turn at least medium range or higher above all enemies while at Initiative 10+.
