This Evocation functions as Frozen Sorcery: Emerald, except that it freezes a spell of the Celestial Circle, the difficulty is (caster’s Essence + 5), and it can only be used once per story. This resets at the end of any scene in which the bearer defeats, suborns, or makes peace with an enemy sorcerer. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.

If an active opponent is prone, pinning him down with the socketed artifact is a difficulty 5 gambit, though the difficulty may vary with circumstances or for nonhuman opponents of unusual size or form. Stone of Comfort (Earth, Standard) Keywords: Steady This smooth white hearthstone offers stability to souls caught in the midst of inward strife. Within a one-mile radius, all characters gain two non-Charm bonus dice on Willpower rolls to resist Derangements, and the cravings of addicts are quelled. Stone of the Ram’s Horn (Earth, Standard) Keywords: None When this furrowed brown orb is socketed into a nonranged weapon, it grants the power to strike with enormous force. That weapon gains the Smashing tag. If it already has Smashing, reduce the Initiative cost of its smashing attacks by one. Caryatid Orb (Earth, Standard) Keywords: None When this white cabochon is slotted into an attuned hearthstone socket, it grants the opportunity to awaken the following Evocation:
