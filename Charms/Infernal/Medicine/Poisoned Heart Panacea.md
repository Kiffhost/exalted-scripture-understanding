*The Infernal’s hatred can be a caustic, poisonous thing. No lesser venom can withstand her all-dissolving spite.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits as long as she has at least one negative Tie
- She adds (Intimacy) dice on rolls to resist poison, using the intensity of her strongest negative Tie.
- Any penalties she suffers from being poisoned are reduced by one.
- Lesser venoms draw her scornful notice. She adds (Intimacy) dice on rolls to diagnose poisoning and on Awareness and Investigation rolls to notice or examine poisons.
- Her blood is a potent antivenin. It counts as exceptional equipment for treating poisoning in others, adding a non-Charm die. It loses its efficacy after a scene.
## [[Keys]]
#### Grudge-Nursing Endurance (Medicine 3, Essence 2)
This Charm’s benefits become permanent. However, the Infernal can’t willingly weaken negative Ties while she’s poisoned, or if doing so would leave her without any negative Ties.
