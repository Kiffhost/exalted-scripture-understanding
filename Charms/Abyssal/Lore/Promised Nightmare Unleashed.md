*Prognostication, any three Lore Charms A prophet of the Neverborn, Death’s Lawgiver unbinds one of the countless dooms the slain titans have dreamt for the world.*
For three nights, the Abyssal communes with the dreams of the Neverborn, drawing their ire towards the region. She rolls (Intelligence + Lore) against a difficulty of her choice to divine the severity of the calamity she will unleash. The Abyssal’s player should work with the Storyteller to determine the exact nature of the doom based on her successes.
### Difficulty 5
A natural disaster with significant local consequences: plague spreads through the region; an unseasonal chill ruins a harvest; a sudden flood destroys critical infrastructure.
### Difficulty 7
A terrible supernatural disaster: an otherworldly tempest wracks a port city; ghost-locust swarms devastate crops and feed on the living; an earthquake opens a passageway into the Labyrinth.
Difficulty 10: A direful calamity falls on a region: A great maelstrom of the Underworld spills forth; an undead behemoth emerges and begins to rampage; the dead begin rising and slaughtering their own friends and family, and so on.
Once the Abyssal has foretold a calamity, she must spend seven days spreading the knowledge and despair of its coming. During this time, she must commit this Charm’s cost. Omens manifest in the region, allowing characters to recognize something terrible is coming with a difficulty 3 ({Intelligence or Perception) + Occult) roll.
Death’s Lawgiver may offer a stricture, allowing those who abide by it to avoid the worst effects of the disaster — the blood of an Immaculate monk drawn on a doorway conceals the residents from the attention of the specters haunting the streets or branding livestock with her Deathlord’s sigil will spare some from blight. After this week, the foretold disaster comes to pass. The prophesied doom can be averted by slaying the Abyssal before the seven days have passed or if she goes a day without spreading despair at its coming. She may also release her commitment to spare the region from disaster.
## Reset
Once per story.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses Nightmare-Carving Murmur in the immediate aftermath of a disaster unleashed with this Charm, she waives the cost of that Charm’s first use and reduces the base difficulty of the roll by two.
