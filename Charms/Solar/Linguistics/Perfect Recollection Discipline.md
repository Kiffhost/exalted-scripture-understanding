Binding a written work or illustration into her consciousness, the Solar creates a perfect memory. A character using this Charm can perfectly memorize such a work in the time it takes to read or study it, activating this Charm to store a mental record of the completed subject. She may then pay one mote to reference any part of the work. As long as she continues to reference the stored work at least once a week, she maintains a perfect memory of any part of it. Once she has maintained such use for a season, the information becomes ingrained and innate, and she may release her mote commitment. If such knowledge fades, the Solar need only pay one mote to revive her memory of the work. Note that this Charm is not a generally eidetic memory: it only conveys memories of that which has been recorded through a medium of language. She can remember what was written on a road sign, but she might be unclear as to where she encountered that sign or what the sign itself looked like. Likewise, memories created in relation to this Charm are not necessarily dependent on magic. Knowledge of a book’s contents, and specific phrases which were significant to her, or which she accessed with this Charm, may stay in her memory after knowledge of a work fades.
