Standing out as the most prominent figure in any room, the Lunar’s magnetic allure draws attention away from her allies. When a character that can see her rolls read intentions against another character, she makes a special ([[Appearance]] + [Presence or Socialize]) persuade roll opposing him. If successful, she catches his attention, redirecting his read intentions roll to target her unless he spends one [[Willpower]]. He’s considered to have failed his read intentions action against the original target, and is subject to the reset rules (Exalted, p. 223). Protean: If the Lunar uses this Charm in a shape that her target has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward, he must enter a Decision Point and call on an [[Intimacy]] of equal or greater intensity to resist.
