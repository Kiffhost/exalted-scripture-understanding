*The Infernal grants her favour to organizations who heed her laws — or her whims.*

The Infernal imposes a burdensome duty or rule upon a group that she holds authority over or whose leader asks for her help. It must be strange, onerous, and unrelated to the group’s usual function, but still something that they can achieve. As long as the group observe upholds this obligation, it gains benefits based on how burdensome a task it is (Exalted, p. 216):
- **Inconvenient**: The group halves the time needed to complete bureaucratic tasks like planning, securing authorization, or allocating resources in connection with its usual function. Any rolls made to carry out projects or oversee the group’s functioning add an automatic success.
- **Serious**: The time needed to complete bureaucratic tasks is reduced by one step: from centuries to decades, decades to years, years to seasons, seasons to months, months to weeks, or weeks to days. The bonus on rolls for leading the group increases to (Infernal’s Essence/2, rounded up) successes.
- **Life-Changing**: The time needed to complete tasks is reduced by one step, and by an additional step at the end of each story, maximum (Essence) steps. The bonus on rolls increases to (Essence) successes.

If the group’s members fail to complete a task on schedule, violate a prohibition, or otherwise circumvent the Infernal’s will, they lose this Charm’s benefits. This inflicts (Essence) botches on rolls made by the group’s leaders to carry out projects or oversee its functioning.
