The Dragon-Blood etches an imprint of her Essence onto another living character’s consciousness, riding his senses from afar to see what he sees and hear what he hears. The Dragon-Blood touches a character and rolls (Manipulation + Awareness) against his Resolve, unmodified by Intimacies. Success establishes a link, allowing the Dragon-Blood to ride the target’s senses by meditating. While using his senses, she may make Perception-based rolls using her own dice pools and Charms, but benefits from any of the target’s Merits that enhance his senses. Depending on her rolls, she may notice details that the target overlooked, or vice versa. This Charm ends if the sense-ridden character goes more than (Essence x5) miles from the Dragon-Blood.
