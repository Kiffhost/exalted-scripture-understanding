The Lunar moves in a blur of superhuman speed. She adds a success to a movement action or an interval of a speed-based extended action. Succeeding on an opposed roll in combat grants one Initiative. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Speed Bonuses, the Initiative awarded to the Lunar for a successful opposed roll is stripped from one of the characters opposing her (her choice).
