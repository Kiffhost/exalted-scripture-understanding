While this book devotes itself to the greater magic of the Exalted—Charms, [[Evocations]], and Sorcery—there is a fourth type of power, a species of unique occult miracles and holistic, ritualized magic known collectively as thaumaturgy. As a form of magic, it is nowhere near as versatile as the [[Charms]] of the Exalted, nor as powerful as [[sorcery]]. 

Just as thaumaturgists (most of whom are mortals) are unique individuals, so too are their rituals. This means that the instinctive secret or trick developed by one thaumaturgist might be completely unique to him, unseen in the world before his birth, and lost to the world after his death—unless he passes it on.

A thaumaturgic ritual known to one thaumaturge may only be passed to another through direct teaching and practice. Simply observing the ritual in practice, or reading about it in a book isn’t sufficient. 
# [[Sorcery]] and Thaumaturges
[[Mortal]] thaumaturges are exceedingly rare. In system terms, a mortal with thaumaturgy has the [[Thaumaturgist]] [[Merits|Merit]]. When one of the Chosen unlocks the power of [[sorcery]], she gains this Merit automatically. [[Mortal]] sorcerers do not gain this Merit automatically, and it cannot be taught, either to mortals or the uninitiated Chosen. One is either born with the power of thaumaturgy or one is not. 

A character with the [[Thaumaturgist]] Merit may learn thaumaturgic rituals. One-dot rituals cost three experience points to learn. These rituals represent the simplest and purest ritual magic available. Two-dot rituals are slightly more complex or difficult, and cost five experience points to learn. Training time for a thaumaturgy ritual is (dot rating) weeks.
# Thaumaturgic Rituals
Though any thaumaturgist will have a unique version of their ritual, some rituals follow predictable patterns, often following the culture or environment of the population the thaumaturge originates from. Here are some examples frequent enough to have been documented by occultists.
