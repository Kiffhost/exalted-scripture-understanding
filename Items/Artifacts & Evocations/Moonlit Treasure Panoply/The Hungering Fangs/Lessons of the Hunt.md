The Hungering Fangs’ master claims the prowess of her prey.
The wielder can use this Evocation when her decisive attack incapacitates an enemy powerful enough to have posed a challenge to her in combat. She gains up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) specialties that reflects that enemy’s strengths or home territory: for instance, a [[Survival]] specialty in tracking for a giant God-Blooded wolf, an [[Occult]] specialty in necromancy or the Underworld for a nephwrack, or a [[Presence]] specialty in alluring beauty from a Fair Folk noble. She can go into experience debt (p. 60) to gain these specialties permanently.
The wielder can have specialties from multiple uses of this Evocation, but never more than (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) — she must discard old specialties if she wishes to take on new ones while at the limit.
## Resonant
Add +1 to the wielder’s maximum number of specialties.
