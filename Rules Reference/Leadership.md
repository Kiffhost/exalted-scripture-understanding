Even the most modest Exalt tends to accumulate power as a rock gathers moss; those with the ambition to rule find little difficulty in amassing followers and authority. The challenge is in ruling well and holding power once gained. The following rules help to tell stories about Exalts dedicated to the leading of companies, cities, cults, and empires. 
# Projects
Leadership is exercised by leading **Projects**. Projects can consist of almost anything involving leading the to a defined goal. A successful project grants the character who initiated it some form of measurable gain; this usually means obtaining a new story Merit, raising the rating of an existing story Merit, or procuring some advantage relevant to the current story.
## Step One: Is the Project Possible?
Before determining the [[#Success and Failure|success or failure]] of a **project**, the first step is for the Storyteller to determine if the project can even be attempted. Does the character have the necessary *resources* to undertake the project? If so, then the project begins. If not, then why not? What is she missing?Unless the character is attempting a wildly impossible project, the Storyteller should inform the player of what her character lacks to make the project possible. It remains up to the ingenuity of the character to resolve this deficiency. Time is always a key resource, especially when multiple projects are in the works.
## Step Two: Does the Project Succeed?
After determining viability, the player doesn’t need to roll anything to see if the project goes forward—by default, projects [[#succeed]] if undertaken properly. But sometimes projects are threatened by [[#failure conditions]]—complications that threaten to ruin the project. 
### Failure conditions
<details> <summary>When do failure conditions appear?</summary>
When do failure conditions appear? Storyteller, this is your call, with the rule of thumb being: a failure condition only happens when its appearance would make the story more interesting. If you don’t have a cool idea for complications in a ruler’s attempt to negotiate a trade agreement with a neighboring nation, the negotiations resolve successfully and a trade agreement is signed. If you have an idea for a story wherein an agent of the Realm attempts to poison the neighboring nation’s ruler against dealings with the player’s character, thus threatening the negotiations—that’s a cool story idea, and a good reason to present a failure condition. </details>

Failure conditions can be almost anything—the point is, a failure condition challenges the ruler instituting the project to respond to it. In general, failure conditions will be more likely the more the leader stands to gain from successful resolution, and also more likely if there are parties opposed to the project's success.
## Step Three: Responding to Failure Conditions
Once a failure condition appears, it has to be dealt with somehow, or else the project will fail. [[#Advisors]] can provide counsel on how to best handle a crisis when rulers aren’t certain of how to proceed. 

Most often, a ruler will use her [[Merits]] to address the failure condition: the character draws on her Resources, calls in favors from [[Allies]], deploys [[Followers]] with skills well-suited to the situation, and so on. Finally, the character might attempt to address [[#failure conditions]] directly with her own Abilities and Charms, or through mighty sorcery. This is often an attractive option, given the prowess of the Exalted, but a leader off personally resolving problems may be neglecting other matters close to home.
### Advisors
In courts with multiple advisors, this is resolved through the [[social influence]] system—a crisis is a ripe time for ambitious members of the court to attempt to bend a ruler’s ear and suggest solutions which will both salvage the project and help advance their own agendas.

Contacts and advisors can also help the character learn more about the nuances of the failure condition before she attempts to address it, and knowledge is almost always helpful in resolving a crisis. 
## Step Four: Dealing With the Result
After the leader has implemented a solution, there are two questions to be addressed: Did her solution resolve the failure condition? And regardless whether or not the project succeeded, what are the consequences of her solution?
### Success and Failure
If a character’s response to the [[#failure conditions]] is inadequate, or if he’s convinced to take no action at all, then the project fails. The leader doesn’t get whatever she wanted to get out of the project, and assets expended are wasted. 

Trying again may or may not be possible, depending on the circumstances—once more, time is important to consider. If there’s no hard deadline for a project, its duration could be extended and the leader might try again, but this usually means allocating even more resources and assets to get the project back on track, which might stretch the organization thin.

If the leader’s actions resolve the failure condition, or if there was no failure condition at all, then the project succeeds, and the leader gets what she was after—new or increased Merits, story advancement, or whatever else the project aimed to achieve.
### Consequences and Complication
Complications can arise as a result of both failed and successful projects, generally as a result of reacting to failure conditions. Complications arise naturally from a leader’s actions. There’s no dice roll—it’s up to the Storyteller whether complications appear. As a general rule, the more carefully and appropriately a situation is handled, the less likely it is that a *negative complication* will emerge afterwards; indeed, particularly skillful resolution may even turn a [[#Failure conditions|failure condition]] into an opportunity for greater profit or success than the project originally encompassed!

Examples of complications that might appear in the wake of an attempt to deal with a failure condition include, but are by no means limited to:
#### Political unrest
This often occurs when a leader implements solutions which may be efficacious, but which outrage the people or upset major elements of her own organization. Political unrest can also occur when a ruler addresses failure conditions personally (that is, with her Attributes, Abilities, and Charms) rather than using her assets, if doing so takes her away from her responsibilities for so long that her organization suffers as a result of neglect. 

Political unrest makes it difficult to implement [[#projects]], radically increases the likelihood of [[#failure conditions]], and may lead to the erosion of [[Merits]] such as [[Influence]] or [[Contacts]]. 

Left unchecked, political unrest can also lead to: [[#Assassins]], [[#Enemies]], [[#War]].
#### Loss of assets
This often occurs when a leader implements an ineffective solution due to lack of information, such as sending soldiers to fight an opponent they have no hope of defeating, or sending lavish bribes to an incorruptible priest-king. The expended resources are simply lost, and their associated Merit, if any, is depleted or vanishes. Loss of assets may also occur on successful projects, of course—sometimes it’s necessary to expend one asset to secure another. Seasoned rulers often try to cultivate re-usable assets such as [[Allies]], [[Contacts]], [[Followers]], and [[Retainers]] for this reason—attempting to solve all problems through vast expenditures of wealth (in the form of [[Resources]]) or political capital (in the form of [[Influence]] or [[Backing]]) can quickly deplete any leader’s strength.
#### War
This often occurs when a leader implements solutions which outrage or threaten a foreign power or rival organization. War can just as easily come from successful projects as unsuccessful ones; assassinations and violent solutions most often breed war, but successfully gaining control of limited regional resources can also provoke it. War is arguably the worst of consequences, as it can threaten the very survival of an organization. 

War, if not resolved quickly, can lead to: [[#Assassins]], [[#Enemies]], [[#Political Unrest]].
#### Enemies
This often occurs when a project’s success (or failure) directly harms some powerful individual who develops a grudge over it. 

Enemies will work against the leader’s interests when the opportunity presents itself, making failure conditions more common until they’re dealt with somehow. Some enemies can be won over through [[social influence]] or bribery; others must be dispatched with force. Of course, incautiously disposing of one enemy can lead to the appearance of others… 

Enemies, left to fester, could potentially lead to [[#Assassins]] or [[#War]].
#### Assassins
This often occurs as the result of trying to undertake projects while suffering the un-addressed consequences of previous projects, such as [[#political unrest]] or [[#enemies]]. Assassins represent direct attempts to take a leader’s life, or at the very least, remove her from power. These don’t tend to threaten [[#projects]] (although they can, if aimed at key personnel rather than the leader herself ) so much as they threaten the leader’s continued ability to draw breath, and are often confronted in combat scenes, when least expected. The Second Age is full of those willing to kill for money, and so resolving assassins is often contingent on resolving the pre-existing complication giving rise to them; simply killing the assassins may not be sufficient (although bribery might work).
#### New Merits
Sometimes complications are good. These often occur as a result of hands-on intervention, as the leader recognizes opportunities for gain outside the initial scope of the project and seizes them. New [[Merits]] often take the form of new [[Allies]] (won over through [[social influence]]), additional [[Resources]] (gained through quick and cunning action), or even [[Artifacts]] (seized from the battlefield).
