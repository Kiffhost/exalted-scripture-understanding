*Ecstatic in battle, the Sidereal welcomes the blows of her enemies and denies them power thereby.*
The Sidereal adds (Charisma) soak against a withering attack. If her attacker’s Initiative is lower than hers or if she’s successfully influenced him with a threaten action this scene, the bonus increases to (Charisma + 2).
If the Sidereal is unarmored, she can use this Charm after being hit by an attack, but before the damage roll.
