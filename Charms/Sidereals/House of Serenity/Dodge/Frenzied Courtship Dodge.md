The Sidereal dodges into the path of romance, making herself an easy target for the arrows of love. After a few hours spent interacting with potential romantic partners, the Sidereal’s assured to find at least one partner willing to engage in courtship, formal marriage negotiations, or a whirlwind romance, chosen by the Storyteller. (Players may volunteer their characters for this.) Alternatively, she can empower an existing courtship. As long as the Sidereal continues this romantic pursuit and spends significant time with her partner during downtimes, she gains the following benefits: 
-  She gains +2 [[Resolve]] against rolls to instill Ties of romantic or sexual desire to anyone but her partner. 
-  Non-[[Hideous]] characters other than her partner don’t add dice from [[Appearance]] on influence rolls against her. 
-  She must treat other character’ bargain and persuade rolls for seduction and instill rolls to weaken Ties of romantic or sexual desire toward her partner as unacceptable. 
-  She shines with the joy of heedless love, waiving Excellencies’ mote costs to reduce the target number of rolls to instill positive Ties or inspire positive emotions. If the Sidereal marries her partner or joins with him in a similar custom, this Charm ends and she can’t use it with him again.
