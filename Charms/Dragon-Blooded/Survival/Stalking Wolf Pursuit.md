Honing her senses with Essence, the Dragon-Blood can hunt her foes no matter how they try to hide. She ignores any penalties on a tracking roll from visual obstructions, the age of the tracks, and similar environmental factors. A successful roll also lets her determine how much time has elapsed since the target left based on the remaining strength of his scent.
