*The Infernal’s smouldering hatred defies any who would usurp her mind, casting off such hateful imprisonment.*

The Infernal can use this Charm to escape Psyche effects, possession, or any other magic that exerts control over her body, mind, or soul. Before she can do so, she must first be forced to act against one of her Intimacies by it. Once she has, she can break free of that effect after a scene spent lashing out with rage, swearing revenge, simmering with venomous resentment, or the like.

The Infernal forms a Tie of spiteful resentment to the character who used that effect, with an intensity depending on the total Willpower cost she would have to pay to resist it: Minor for one Willpower, Major for two to three Willpower, or Defining for more. If she already has a negative Tie to that character of equal or greater intensity, she strengthens that Intimacy by one step and may optionally change its emotional context to spiteful resentment. She can’t voluntarily weaken this Tie for the rest of the story.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Sevenfold Vengeance Oath]] reflexively to empower the Tie she forms, waiving that Charm’s Willpower cost.
## Reset
Once per story. If a character successfully uses a Psyche effect or similar magic against the Infernal, she can reset this Charm by raising a negative Tie toward the influencing character to Defining intensity. If she already has a Defining Tie to a character when he uses the offending effect, this Charm is reset immediately.
