Dematerialized characters cannot normally be interacted with by ordinary (materialized) characters, they may not even be able to be perceived by them, though dematerialized characters can usually see (but not directly interact with) their material counterparts.
It is usually assumed that dematerialized characters may interact with other dematerialized characters "normally", that is, in the same way they would if both were materialized.
# Perceiving and interacting
Magic, including [[Charms]] like [[Perceiving the Hidden World]], or wonders like [[Bright Morning]] can allow perception of the dematerialized. While different magic like [[Mortification of the Hallowed Self]] or [[Ghost Flower Tea]] may allow interaction with them.
Striking a dematerialized character that the attacker cannot see applies a -3 penalty on the [[Attack#hit roll]] (which seems to be the usual penalty for blind fighting).
# Naturally dematerialized
Spirits, including Ghosts, Elementals, Gods and Demons are often naturally dematerialized, meaning that is there usual state, and some can materialize (or "manifest") or dematerialize at will.
