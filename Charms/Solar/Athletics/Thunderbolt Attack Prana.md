The Exalt draws down on the Essence around her, pulling it through her upper body, her lungs, her core and down into her legs, and then explodes skyward, rising in a brilliant, Essence-laden arc. This Charm supplements a nonranged attack which can be made against aerial targets up to short range, or ground targets at another range band. The Solar leaps at her target, striking with incredible force— damage is doubled after it is rolled. If the Exalt uses this attack to move to another range band, it counts as her movement action for the round. After striking an aerial opponent, the Exalt may fall one range band without taking damage. Thunderbolt Attack Prana is expressly permitted to be used in conjunction with Charms of other Abilities, and it is suggested that the player use it to create a signature attack that fits the character’s attitude and style.
