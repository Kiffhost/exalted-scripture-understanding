*When the necromancer uncovers information about another portion of the Skull Diary or similar necromantic relic, learns of a necromantic working or phenomena to study, or succeeds on an [[Occult]] roll to uncover more about such subjects, she gains one necromantic mote, which lasts until the story ends, up to 10 necromantic motes maximum.*
Once per story, when she acquires another fragment of the Skull Diary, the necromancer gains necromantic motes equal to ([[Essence]] + the number of skulls she possesses, maximum 15) which last for the rest of the story.
