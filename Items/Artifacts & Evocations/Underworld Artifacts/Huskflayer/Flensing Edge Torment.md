*Huskflayer’s edge tears through armor to feast on flesh.*
The wielder subtracts Huskflayer’s Overwhelming from her enemy’s soak against a withering attack, or from his [[Hardness]] against a decisive attack. If this reduces the penalized trait to zero, the wielder gains an additional gore point (even on a withering attack).
If the wielder uses this Evocation on a piercing attack (Exalted, p. 586), that tag’s effects apply to natural soak as well as armored soak. If she gains any gore points, the piercing attack’s [[Initiative]] cost is refunded.
