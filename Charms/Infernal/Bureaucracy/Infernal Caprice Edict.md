*If a Green Sun Prince says it is law, who would dare to gainsay her?*

The Infernal proclaims a law of Hell — potentially one that she makes up on the spot — and rolls ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Bureaucracy) with double 9s to instil a Principle based on adherence to this law. Alternatively, the Infernal can make a persuade roll that leverages an Intimacy she’s instilled with this Charm. First Circle demons and characters with Ties of reverence toward the Infernal suffer −1 Resolve.

If a character wishes to spend Willpower to resist being instilled with a Minor Intimacy, he must enter a Decision Point and cite at least a Minor Intimacy to do so.
### Keys
#### Counter-Pronouncement of Enthymemic Law (Bureaucracy 4, Essence 2)
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively to oppose social influence or a Shaping effect with this Charm’s roll, citing or inventing a law that forbids such trespasses. Its influence always applies against the character who uses the opposing effect, but doesn’t affect others unless the Infernal wins the opposed roll.
#### Proscribed Blasphemy Expurgation (Bureaucracy 5, Essence 3, Counter-Pronouncement of Enthymemic Law) (+6m, 1wp)
If the Infernal pays a six-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses [[#Counter-Pronouncement of Enthymemic Law (Bureaucracy 4, Essence 2)|Counter-Pronouncement of Enthymemic Law]], winning the opposed roll causes the effect to automatically fail against any other characters targeted by it. If this spares a character from an unwanted effect, he must cite a Major or Defining Intimacy to resist being instilled with a Minor Principle by the Infernal’s influence.
