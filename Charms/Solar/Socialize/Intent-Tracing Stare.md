The Solar becomes preternaturally aware of the social scene, able to read invisible subtexts and sense the intensifying focus of another’s scrutiny. Each time the Solar or a character within five feet is the target of a read intentions action, the Exalt feels a tingle at the base of her skull telling her to activate this Charm. Upon doing so, she can discern not only who the target of the action is, but who is watching them. The Solar must be aware of the initiate to notice him—this Charm does not grant the ability to spot hidden characters, though it does allow the Exalt to reflexively apply a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) check to try to notice hidden initiates.
