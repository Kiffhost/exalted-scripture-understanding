*A [[direlance]] is a massive spear forged with an alloy of one of the magical materials.*
Its sturdy construction allows it to be used to make mounted charges like a lance or be wielded as a long spear in melee. If used like a lance, the [[direlance]] may be used single-handed during a mounted charge. If used as a spear, a [[direlance]] requires two hands to wield.
