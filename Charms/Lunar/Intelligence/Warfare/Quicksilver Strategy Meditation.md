*The Lunar’s plans are formless and enigmatic, adapting to foes’ strategies and unexpected circumstances.*
She makes a Strategic Maneuver roll, selecting two potential stratagems to enact. She may allocate her extra successes to whichever stratagem she wishes, and if she rolls enough to meet both their thresholds, may enact them simultaneously.
