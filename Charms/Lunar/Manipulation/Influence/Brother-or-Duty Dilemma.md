The Lunar plays her victim’s passions against his beliefs. When an influence roll with any Attribute exploits a Tie to an individual, her target can’t use a Tie to a group or a Principle to bolster his [[Resolve]], or in a Decision Point, if its intensity is lower. 
## Protean 

If the exploited Tie is toward the Lunar’s current shape, her victim can’t use such Intimacies at all.
