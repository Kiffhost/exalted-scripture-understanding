*The sorcerer reaches out to an ancient enemy of the Yozis, forever chained in darkness beyond the world. The fetters that bind it cannot — must not — be disturbed, but the sorcerer’s profane magic extracts a sliver of its power and authority over its teeming servant-limbs.*

The sorcerer spends six hours chanting an invocation over a pool of scented black oil. At the culmination of the ritual, she submerges herself in the pool and is transported into the prison-realm of the Eyeless Face for one hour before returning. When she emerges from the pool, hundreds of uncanny beings crawl from the oil with her, depleting the pool with each one that emerges until the last drains it entirely. They are humanoid, but clearly inhuman. Their bodies are irregularly asymmetrical, smooth and sexless, with iridescent black flesh like solidified tar that’s pliant to the touch. Their faces are blank ovals of maggot-pale skin, entirely lacking features. These are the [[#Minions of the Eyeless Face]], and they will serve the sorcerer until death.

This spell brings forth enough Minions to form a Size 5 battle group. They have perfect morale, elite Drill, and Might 1, which increases to Might 2 while lead by the sorcerer. They have no equipment when summoned, but can use weapons and armor suitable for humans. They act with eerie uniformity, but the longer they spend outside their prison the more they develop individual personalities, sometimes adorning themselves in jewellery or piercing their unfeeling flesh to better distinguish their appearances.

The sorcerer is changed from her journey as well, a transformation that lasts for this spell’s duration. Her irises vanish, and her body is unsettlingly still at rest and precise in its movements. She becomes a creature of darkness if she wasn’t already. While under the effects of the spell, she gains the following powers:
- **The Eyes of the Eyeless** (5m, Simple; One scene): The sorcerer can extend her senses through one of her Minions, even sight, regardless of range. She uses her own dice pools for any observation-related rolls and can enhance them with her Charms as usual. However, she’s unable to return to her own perspective unless she ends this power.
- **Servant-Limb Command** (3m; Reflexive; Instant): The sorcerer can mentally communicate a message to any number of Minions, regardless of distance. She can use this together with a command action targeting a battle group of Minions, letting her roll with (Intelligence + Occult).
- **Slave-Marrow Consumption** (20m, 2wp; Simple; Until end of next turn): The sorcerer vanishes at the end of her next turn, reappearing by manifesting through a Minion’s body, regardless of distance. The Minion painfully transforms into the sorcerer, a process that’s essentially fatal for it. This is interrupted if the sorcerer is crashed or incapacitated before her next turn, causing her to reappear at her original location.
- **Thousand Ears Listening** (Permanent): The sorcerer is always aware of the approximate locations of each of her Minions. She senses when her name is spoken in a Minion’s presence, though she doesn’t hear anything else that’s said.

The sorcerer can replenish her Minions’ numbers by casting the spell again while it’s still active, reducing its Willpower cost by one. Doing so brings forth enough Minions to restore them to Size 5.

Once this spell ends, the Minions choose to die, rather than return to the Eyeless Face.
# Control
The sorcerer’s transformation becomes more profound when she casts this spell, causing her to resemble a strange amalgam of her original appearance and that of the Minions. She gains their [[#Alien Biology]] Merit, and the [[Hideous]] Merit if she lacked it.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 20)
The sorcerer’s hold over her Minions weakens. For the rest of the scene, she can’t use any powers granted by the spell. Her Minions lose the benefits of their [[#Binding Freedom]] and [[#Synchronized Obedience]] Merits, and no longer have perfect morale in battle.
# Minions of the Eyeless Face
These traits represent a Minion bearing weapons and armor given to it by its master.

#### *Merits*
###### Alien Biology
Under their elastic skin, the Minions have a bizarre physiology composed of compounded layers of dry powder. They have Exalted Healing, are immune to mundane disease and poisons, and do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep.
###### Binding Freedom
Social influence that would weaken or alter a Minion’s Tie to the sorcerer or stop it from fulfilling her instructions is unacceptable, unless it comes from the Eyeless Face.
###### Eyeless
Minions are blind, but suffer no penalties because of this.
###### Synchronized Obedience
Minions double 9s on rolls made to fulfil the sorcerer’s instructions. Once per scene, a minion can add five dice on such an action.
###### Voiceless Thrall
Minions cannot speak, but understand Old Realm. They suffer no impediments from communicating through body language and pantomime.
