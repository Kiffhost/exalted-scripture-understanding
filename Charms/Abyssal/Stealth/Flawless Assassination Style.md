*The deathknight does not permit her victims the privilege of seeing her before they die.*
The Abyssals rolls [[Join Battle]] with ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]), which also counts as a roll to enter concealment, opposed by her enemy’s [[Join Battle]] rolls. Enemies who use magic to roll [[Join Battle]] with a different dice pool must instead roll ([[Wits]] + [[Awareness]]) separately, with 1s subtracting successes. If the Abyssal’s [[Join Battle]] roll beat theirs, 2s also subtract successes on the [[Awareness]] roll.
