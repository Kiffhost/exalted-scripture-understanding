*The sorcerer coaxes her voice from her throat as a coruscating spear of song and lightning. Through this art, the sorcerers of eld delivered their edicts to entire empires at once.*

The sorcerer transforms her voice into a spear (Accuracy +2, Damage 9L, Defense +1, Overwhelming 1). This leaves her mute for the spell’s duration. The voice-spear cannot be disarmed or destroyed. Successfully attacking or parrying with it releases a bone-rattling shout; other characters within medium range must make a difficulty 3 (Stamina + Resistance) roll or be deafened until the end of her next turn. However, this is but a fragment of this spell’s true power.

The sorcerer can deliver a message through the spear by launching it into the sky as a miscellaneous action. Over the course of a minute, a column of dark storm clouds forms in the sorcerer’s likeness, quelling all other weather within (Essence) miles, save only for weather conjured by Solar Circle sorcery, the Celestial Incarnae, the Yozis, or beings of comparable power. The storm-visage delivers a short speech of roughly (Essence) sentences in a thundering voice that can be heard clearly for (Essence x 50) miles. The sorcerer can use this to make an influence roll against everyone who hears the message, ignoring multiple target penalties, but can’t enhance it with Charms other than Excellencies.

The sorcerer may cast her spear farther afield, choosing a location she’s aware of in the same realm of existence. The spear flies there by the most direct route possible at 100 miles per hour, delivering its message as above once it arrives.
# Control
The sorcerer has perfect control over the volume of her voice. She can speak loudly enough to be heard clearly out to one range band beyond long range, or render her voice quiet enough to be heard only by those within a chosen distance. Her voice-spear has artifact traits, and she can awaken Evocations from it as if it were a five-dot artifact. The difficulty of the roll to resist deafening increases to 5 and it lasts until the end of the scene.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 25)
This spell can be distorted only after the storm-visage begins to take form, but before it delivers its message. Successful distortion reduces the storm-visage’s range to (Essence) miles. Alternatively, the opposing sorcerer may censor its proclamation. He learns what its message is before it speaks and may render a single sentence inaudible, replaced with a terrible, electric buzzing.
