*The Exalt unbinds one of the horrific visions forged into [[Nightmare Shard]], infecting her victim’s wounds with a malaise of nightmares that spread through his soul.*
An enemy that takes 1+ damage from a supplemented decisive attack is exposed to the supernatural disease known as cracked mirror blight. Its virulence is the wielder’s ([[Manipulation]]), its morbidity is her (lower of [[Essence]] or [[Manipulation]]), and it has an interval of one week (Exalted, p. 232). All rolls made to resist it use ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) in place of ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). Medical treatment is useless unless enhanced by magic. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used once per scene unless reset by crashing or incapacitating an enemy who suffers from a [[Derangement]], whether inflicted through [[Nightmare Shard]] or not. 

## Resonant

An [[Essence]] 2 repurchase adds +2 to its virulence and morbidity, and lowers its interval to one day.
