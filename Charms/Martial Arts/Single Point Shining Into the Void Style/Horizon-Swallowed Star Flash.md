Moving without the least sign of effort, the swordsman repels the blows of her attackers in a flash of steel before sheathing her sword, as if to seal away the wasted force of their strikes. Horizon-Swallowed Star Flash allows the martial artist to make a reflexive clash attack. A successful attack grants Initiative equal to her extra successes, up to a maximum of her Wits. This Initiative is added before calculating the raw damage of the attack. While this style’s form is active, the stylist chooses whether to use her Initiative pool or her sword’s when making this clash attack. If she clashes, and then in the same round uses the other Initiative pool to make a decisive attack against the same enemy, that attack also receives the +1 damage bonus of being a clash attack. This combination move is known as the Shattered Mirror Nova-Strike. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood treats the clash attack granted by this Charm as her attack action for the round, and cannot make another. If she has already attacked this round, then it counts as her attack for her next turn. 

## Mastery

The martial artist’s attacker loses Initiative equal to the amount that the swordsman gains with this Charm.
