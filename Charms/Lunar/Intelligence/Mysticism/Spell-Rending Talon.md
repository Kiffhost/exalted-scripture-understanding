The Lunar’s claws rend sorcery as easily as flesh. To use this Charm, she must have Initiative 12+. When she makes a decisive attack against an enemy benefitting from a spell that affects only him, each level of damage inflicted also counts as two successes toward distorting the spell (Exalted, p. 466). This doesn’t count toward the terminus for distortion.
