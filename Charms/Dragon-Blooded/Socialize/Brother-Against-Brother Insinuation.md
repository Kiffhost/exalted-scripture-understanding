Sometimes a lone spark is all it takes to destroy a relationship. The Dragon-Blood makes an instill roll with double 9s to either weaken a positive Tie towards a character that belongs to the same culture or social group as her target, or to instill a negative tie towards such a character. In addition, targets cannot draw on Intimacies towards the culture or group they share to bolster [[Resolve]] against this influence.
