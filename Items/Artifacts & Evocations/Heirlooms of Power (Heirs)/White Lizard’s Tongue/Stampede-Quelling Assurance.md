The whipcrack of White Lizard’s Tongue sounds out over the din of the battlefield, steeling its wielder’s herd against panic. When a character makes a fear-based influence targeting one or more animals, the wielder may make a special (Charisma + [Ride or Survival]) inspire roll with double 9s.
All targeted animals may use this result in place of their base Resolve against the influence. Branded animals are treated as having a Minor Tie of loyalty to the wielder, or treat the intensity of an existing positive Tie to her as one step higher. Intelligent and magical animals can benefit from this Evocation, but it doesn’t apply against any influence that would be incomprehensible to normal animals.
Alternatively, the wielder can use this Evocation when a mounted battle group or a battle group made up entirely of animals makes a rout check to add (higher of Ride or Survival) dice.

## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens for free once the wielder owns enough animals to form a Size 2+ battle group. Animals with Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size don’t count toward this.
## Resonant
With an Essence 3 repurchase, the wielder may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Evocation’s benefits to non-animals.
