Allies, magic, and even personal might will only take a hero so far—the rest comes from within. Your character’s [[Willpower]] represents her drive and determination, quantifying her dedication on a scale of one through ten. Characters on the lower end of the scale tend to be meek and hesitant, while characters on the higher end are confident and certain. Like Attributes and Abilities, [[Willpower]] is a rating, and it may be increased by spending bonus points or experience. By default, Solar characters begin play with a [[Willpower]] rating of five dots—Exaltation does not favor the weak of heart. 

[[Willpower]] also has an associated point pool, which represents how determined your character is at the moment— even the Exalted can be worn down if they constantly push their limits. All characters begin play with [[Willpower]] points equal to their permanent [[Willpower]] rating, but this is not a hard cap. As your character bolsters himself and achieves his goals, he gains [[Willpower]] points. **Willpower points gained in certain ways can raise the total number of points in your character’s [[Willpower]] pool above his rating, to a maximum of 10.**

If a roll calls for [[Willpower]] as part of its pool, you generally roll your character’s permanent rating, not the number of points in his pool, unless specified otherwise. 
# Spending [[Willpower]]
You can spend [[Willpower]] points to do the following things:
- Add one automatic success to a single roll. You can only spend one [[Willpower]] point per roll this way, and you must spend it before you make the roll.
- Increase a single static value (such as [[Defense]] or [[Resolve]]) by 1. You can only spend one [[Willpower]] point per opposing roll, and you must do so before your opponent’s player rolls.
- Reject certain kinds of social influence (see Chapter Five).
- Use a Charm that costs [[Willpower]].
# Gaining [[Willpower]] 
Your character gains [[Willpower]] when the following conditions are met:
- A good night’s sleep restores one [[Willpower]] point, but cannot raise a character’s [[Willpower]] points above his permanent [[Willpower]] rating. Certain characters might not require sleep—in their case, six to eight hours of rest or meditation will suffice, although this bonus can only be gained once per day. 
- Your character gains one [[Willpower]] point if he undergoes significant hardship or sacrifice to uphold a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]]. He may only gain one [[Willpower]] point per scene this way. [[Willpower]] gained in this fashion may exceed his permanent [[Willpower]] rating.
- Achieving a major character or story goal is grounds for gaining [[Willpower]]. The Storyteller may award one to three points of [[Willpower]], depending on the scale and significance of the goal, and these may exceed the character’s permanent [[Willpower]] rating.
- Performing a two-point stunt grants one point of [[Willpower]], while performing a three-point awards may stunt grants two. Three-point awards may exceed the character’s permanent [[Willpower]] rating. 

Additionally, there are several conditions which will refresh a character’s [[Willpower]] points. At the beginning of a new story, if your character’s [[Willpower]] points are lower than his permanent rating, they’re refilled to equal it. The catharsis of [[Limit Break]] also resets the character’s [[Willpower]] to its permanent rating—even if this means losing excess [[Willpower]].
