 [[White Lizard’s Tongue]] learned much from its time in the Nine Bones Thief’s hand, and is eager to share with its wielder. This Evocation enhances the following Dragon-Blooded [[Charms]] as described below:
 - [[Scent-of-Crime Method]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 198) lets her detect anyone who’s ever attempted to steal an animal belonging to her, regardless of how long ago it was done. She can distinguish such characters from other criminals by the earthy scent that clings to them.
 - When she uses [[Nimble Thief’s Fingers]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 202), she can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to take the enhanced action out to short range using [[White Lizard’s Tongue]].
 - [[Beast-Taming Aspect]] (Dragon-Blooded, p. 271) allows her to claim familiars in (familiar’s [[Resolve]] − wielder’s [[Charisma]], minimum 1) weeks.
 - When she uses [[Rearing Stallion Provocation]] (p. 146), the equipment bonus from [[White Lizard’s Tongue]] is converted to a non-Charm success.
