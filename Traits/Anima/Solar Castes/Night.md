Darkness seems welcoming to those who cannot abide the Sun’s light. The night is home to many threats, from thieves and murderers to outcast gods and the walking dead. Some think themselves safe, for the eyes of the Sun are not upon them. They are wrong. The Solars of the [[Night]] Caste are the hidden hands of the Unconquered Sun—they fight the enemies of righteousness on their foes’ terms, using the arts of spycraft and assassination to bring their quarry low. While some might think their methods unsavory, the Iron Wolves know they’re simply doing what must be done. 

At the height of the Solars’ reign, the [[Night]] Caste kept the Old Realm safe from threats within and without. They spied on the princes of Hell, kept a watchful eye on rogue Exalted, and assassinated faerie lords in their courts. The Daggers of Heaven kept a hand on the pulse of the world’s criminals, breaking up crime syndicates and watching their fellows for signs of subversion. When the Dragon-Blooded struck, many Nights vanished into the shadows. They waged a bloody guerrilla war against the usurpers, striking whenever the Terrestrials grew complacent. But even they couldn’t hide forever, and one by one the Hidden Suns fell to Dragon-Blooded hunters.

The Solars of the [[Night]] Caste have returned to a world where the shadows have grown longer, and the things hiding in them have grown more vicious. They meet the challenge with sharpened blades, stalking through dark alleys and abandoned mausoleums in search of their quarry. But assassination is not their only means of dealing with such foes. It’s no coincidence that the Nights are also famed for their skills at spycraft—they know that the right piece of information slipped to the right person at the right time can lay any foe low. 

Nights are used to unconventional methods. Some were outlaws prior to their Exaltation, and some made a living hunting outlaws down. Others were information-brokers, members of secret societies, or spies. All Nights share an appreciation for subtle methods, regardless of who they were in their mortal lives. The Iron Wolves are often a Circle’s eyes and ears, watching enemy movements and reporting back with their findings. They excel at finding effective and unorthodox solutions—though the legality of those solutions is often sketchy at best.

# Anima Banner

A Night’s Caste Mark is an empty golden circle on the brow. [[Night]] Caste animas are pale gold with hues of ghostly white, soft violet, and luminous grey. 

# Anima Effects

It is as difficult to find a [[Night]] Caste in a den of villains as it is to find the Unconquered Sun at midnight; shadows bend to conceal them, and their very anima colludes to keep their location and identity a secret. See page 176 for details 
- For two motes, the [[Night]] can dampen her anima, treating all Peripheral [[Essence]] expenditures as if they were Personal for one instant.
- For three motes, the [[Night]] can ignore up to (higher of 3 or [[Essence]]) penalties to a [[Stealth]] attempt for one instant. These motes are always considered Personal, regardless of the pool they’re spent from.
- When the Night’s anima is at the bonfire/iconic level, it wraps around and suffuses her form, hiding her figure and masking her visage in flame. She is merely a fearsome silhouette shrouded in all the hues of evening. It becomes impossible to discern her identity. This is considered a perfect effect, and cannot be pierced by [[Eye of the Unconquered Sun]] (see p. 273) or other all-seeing magic.
