*Ignorance is the greatest enemy of all.*
The wielder may use this Evocation on her turn to reflexively roll to introduce a fact (Exalted, p. 237). If she describes her attack that turn with a stunt based on the introduced fact, she adds a non-Charm bonus success on the roll. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this can apply to other actions using [[Sun’s Brush]]. This Evocation is still subject to the once-per-scene restriction on introducing facts. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with orichalcum, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she succeeds with 5+ successes on a roll to introduce or challenge a fact.
