*The Abyssal need not speak to be obeyed, impressing her wrath upon her soldiers’ minds.*
The Abyssal extends tendrils of thought to any number of allied battle groups within long range, mentally linking herself to her forces. She gains the following benefits
- She can communicate with her forces and make command actions mentally, potentially negating penalties due to her forces being unable to hear her commands. Her communications can’t be intercepted without magic specifically suited to this purpose.
- She can include a command action targeting a linked battle group in a flurry. This won’t let her flurry an order action with an attack.
- Linked battle groups are unaffected by the Demoralized stratagem or magic that would cause them to betray the Abyssal in mid-battle, like First-in-School Assumption (Lunars, p.
225).
If the Abyssal is incapacitated, all linked battle groups must make a difficulty 1 rout check as this connection is severed.
This Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes if the Abyssal only assumes control of undead battle groups and battle groups that benefit from Acclaimed Company of Sinners.
