*Screams and ringing iron echo from within the Abyssal’s anima as her she hammers Essence and nightmares into void-black armor.*
The Abyssal creates artifact armor from Essence and dons it instantly. The type of armor created and its appearance are the same each time she uses this Charm.
Additionally, the Abyssal steals one Initiative from her attacker whenever her soak reduces a withering attack to the minimum damage or her Hardness negates a decisive attack. If this crashes her attacker, he loses one Willpower.
The deathknight may fuse the Wraith-Forged Plate with any artifact armor she’s currently wearing, enjoying the best of both armors’ traits and applying this Charm’s benefits to her armor. Artifact armor’s attunement cost is waived for this Charm’s duration, releasing the committed motes.
This Charm may be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation to the armor.
These Evocations’ themes and functions derive from the Abyssal’s personality, Caste, and iconic anima banner.
With Essence 3, this Charm’s duration becomes Indefinite.
