Looping a strand of saffron [[Essence]] around herself and her foe, the Sidereal pulls them both down into the vasty depth to fight alone. The Sidereal can use this Charm on her turn to reflexively make an unblockable gambit against an enemy within medium range. The gambit’s difficulty is the target’s (higher of [[Essence]] or 3). If successful, both of them vanish from the battlefield, reappearing in a vast cavern, full of shadows and thorns, whose location is known only to Mercury. The distance between the two of them remains unchanged. The combatants return to the world once the scene ends, when one of them is incapacitated, or if neither wish to continue fighting. They can also escape by successfully withdrawing from combat (Exalted, p. 199), finding a secret path out of the cavern. The cavern is wide open, allowing the vanished combats to move freely across it in any direction. At the Storyteller’s discretion, it may include difficult terrain — stalagmites, briars, etc. — or other natural features. Some claim to have seen strange ghosts within it, though this is unsubstantiated. While the Sidereal and her foe are within it, others can’t perceive or interact with them, or vice versa, but magic like [[Silver Curtain Parted]] (Lunars, p. 249) can let characters follow them into the cavern.
