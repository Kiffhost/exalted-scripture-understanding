The archer experiences a moment of near-release in which she almost loses herself in the flowing and deadly instincts of [[Moonlit Huntress]]. Rather than being carried away, her long communion with the bow mingles these killing instincts with the archerâ€™s own [[Essence]], granting a powerful unity of user and weapon. Activating this Evocation grants 15 points of [[Initiative]], and while it is active, the character enjoys the benefits of all five phases of [[Moonlit Huntress]] at once, regardless of her current [[Initiative]] rating. This Evocation may only be used once per day. 

## Special activation rules

The character must have primarily wielded [[Moonlit Huntress]] in battle for at least two stories before she can purchase this Evocation.
