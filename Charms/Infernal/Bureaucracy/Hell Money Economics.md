*Even in Hell, money is power — and there is no form of power beyond a Green Sun Prince’s reach.*

The Infernal adds (Essence) dice and doubles 9s on a Bureaucracy or Lore roll that involves understanding finance. If the roll involves the economies of Hell, she converts the bonus dice to automatic successes.

The Infernal can also use this Charm to enhance threaten rolls that involve finances, such as threatening to bankrupt a business rival or intimidating a local governor with the threat of an audit.
