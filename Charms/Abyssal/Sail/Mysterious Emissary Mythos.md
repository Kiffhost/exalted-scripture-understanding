*Death’s Lawgiver unfurls her anima banner like a tapestry of her bloody deeds, blazing from the mast of her flagship or wreathing her in darkness as she walks the courts of the mighty.*
While the Abyssal is at bonfire anima, she may pay a four-mote surcharge to use [[Scandalous Seafarer Debut]] instantly. Her legend radiates from her anima banner, spreading through strange signs and misty phantasmagoria wherever its dark light touches. This is visible for miles, as usual for bonfire anima. If the Abyssal uses this Charm aboard her ship, she may also expend her anima banner to wreathe the ship’s sails in it, making her anima visible for out to ([[Essence]] x5) miles.
While using [[Legend of Dark Waters]], the Abyssal gains an additional benefit if her attitude fits the story she spreads with [[Scandalous Seafarer Debut]]. Normally, this only affects characters within long range and lasts as long as the Abyssal remains at bonfire anima, maximum one per scene. If used aboard a ship, it affects anyone who can see the Abyssal’s anima and lasts one scene.
Alluring: Characters treat this as an instill roll to gain or strengthen an [[Intimacy]] of awe, fascination, or obsession with the Abyssal.
Eminent: Characters treat this as an influence roll to convince them not to interfere with the Abyssal, showing her the deference due to a diplomat’s vessel.
Hallowed: Characters treat this as an inspire roll to create feelings of grief, regret, or horror at the Abyssal’s choice.
Vicious: Characters treat this as a threaten roll to cow them into submission.
