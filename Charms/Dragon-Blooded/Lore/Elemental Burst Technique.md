*When the Dragon-Blood uses [[Elemental Bolt Attack]] to make a decisive attack with the same aspect as her current Aura state, she may apply the attack against all characters, friend or foe, within close range of her initial target.*
She divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among all hit characters, rounding down, to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring [[Hardness]]. Additionally, the attack gains a benefit based on its aspect. Air: Lightning arcs from foe to foe. Metal weapons, including those made of the five magical materials, can’t be used to parry the attack. For each enemy hit by the attack, the Dragon-Blood adds one bonus die to the base damage rolled against each of them, maximum +([[Essence]]). Earth: The Dragon-Blood adds (Strength/2, rounded up) to the base damage rolled against each hit character, and waives the [[Initiative]] cost and [[Defense]] penalty for making a smash attack. Fire: As long as the elemental blast deals 3+ total levels of damage, the targeted area catches fire as long as it contains flammable materials, becoming an environmental hazard with difficulty 4, Damage ([[Essence]] − 1)L/round. The hazard burns for at least ([[Essence]]) rounds unless extinguished. Water: Enemies with an [[Initiative]] lower than the Dragon-Blood’s when she makes the attack are disarmed (Exalted, p. 200) if they take any damage. Wood: The elemental bolt’s poison is upgraded to Damage 1L, Duration ([[Essence]] + 5), penalty −3. [[Elemental Burst Technique]] can only be used once per scene, unless reset by dealing enough withering damage to a nontrivial opponent with [[Elemental Bolt Attack]] to reduce his [[Initiative]] from a rating higher than the Dragon-Blood’s to a lower rating.
