Some Charms and other magic require the user to share an Intimacy with other characters to take effect. These don’t mean that the two Intimacies have to be worded in exactly the same way — as long as the Storyteller feels that the two Intimacies are identical in the substance of what they mean for the characters that possess them, she should deem that such effects apply. This should be assessed generously to the player.
