Palming a mote of Essence, the Lawgiver pulls a thorn from her heart and fires it at the breast of her enemy. With this Charm, the Solar may continue firing her bow even when she has run out of arrows. In addition, once per scene, the Exalt may suffuse a phantom or physical arrow with the import of one of her Intimacies. Doing so gives her attack a number of nonCharm bonus dice equal to the Intimacy’s strength, but also temporarily numbs her to that Intimacy. She may not use this attack again until she has spent significant effort in restoring or remembering the Intimacy, or in the case of a negative Intimacy, has been reminded of her motivation for her ire. Adamant Arrow Technique: At Essence 3+, the Solar may infuse a single phantom or physical arrow per scene with her enduring Essence. So long as she lives, the arrow cannot be destroyed or pulled from the target. Such arrows can be moved by cutting away the base into which they have landed—a tree can still be cut down, a wall still reduced to rubble—but the arrow will remain inviolate. Only the Solar who fired this arrow, or one blessed with her permission, may remove it from its resting place.
