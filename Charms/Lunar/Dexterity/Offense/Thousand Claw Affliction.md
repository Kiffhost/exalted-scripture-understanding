*Moving in time to an instinctive battle rhythm, the Lunar unleashes rapid violence.*
She makes ([[Essence]], maximum 5) withering attacks against one or more enemies. She doesn’t need to use the same Ability for all attacks, and may reflexively change weapons between attacks. She can’t gain more than ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] from any one damage roll (but still gains the full [[Initiative]] awards for hitting or crashing enemies). This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating an enemy with a decisive attack that resets the Lunar’s [[Initiative]], then reaching [[Initiative]] 15+. 
## Protean 

In shapes with more than four limbs, the Lunar can gain ([[Essence]] + 2) [[Initiative]] from each damage roll.
