The Exalt’s resilient anima encompasses her every cell and fiber, rejuvenating her at the brink of death. When the Exalt recovers from Initiative crash, she automatically heals two health levels, starting with -2s and continuing to her -1 and then her -0 health levels. This Charm does not heal wounds with penalties greater than -2, but will heal wounds even when the Solar is at -4—a Solar using this Charm with a “gap” in her damage track continues to suffer from her highest wound penalty but takes new wounds in the first available health box. This power may be invoked once per fight, and the player may dictate when this effect triggers, choosing to save it for a later crash. Once it has been used, Tiger Warrior’s Endurance can be reset by gaining 20+ Initiative.
