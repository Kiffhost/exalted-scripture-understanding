The Lunar enshrines her deeds within her panoply, inscribing her mythos into their Essence. Upon using an Evocation awakened with Rousing Hidden Power to uphold a Major or Defining Intimacy, achieve a major character or story goal, or accomplish a legendary social goal, she permanently awakens that Evocation at no experience point cost. Once the Lunar has used this Charm, she canâ€™t use it again until she awakens an Evocation by spending experience points or meeting its special activation condition. Even then, it can only be used once per story.
