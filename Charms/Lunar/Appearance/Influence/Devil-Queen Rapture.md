Creation is a mirror wherein the Lunar is reflected, basking in her transcendent glory. When she succeeds on an influence roll with any Attribute to threaten or seduce one character, she gains motes equal to the number of dice added by her Appearance (Exalted, p. 218). This can’t exceed the number of motes she spent enhancing the roll and doesn’t stack with other Charms that award motes for successful influence rolls.
