Clothed in myth and legend, the wearer embodies the Childe through her deeds. When she upholds an Intimacy gained with Becoming Midnight’s Childe with an influence roll, read intentions roll, Larceny roll, or an application of Resolve or Guile, she adds (Intimacy) non-Charm dice, or +(Intimacy/2, rounded up) nonCharm Guile or Resolve. She can’t voluntarily erode that Intimacy for the rest of the story.
## Resonant
If an opposing character has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward the wearer, she may use this Evocation even if it doesn’t uphold an Intimacy from Becoming Midnight’s Childe.
