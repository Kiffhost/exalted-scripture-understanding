The Lunar can train animals in latent special abilities or Merits (Exalted, p. 554) without meeting the normal specialty requirements, shortening the training interval to one week. If she’s unlocked that trait for any of her animal shapes, she doubles 8s on training rolls. With Wits 4, Essence 3, she can train familiars she’s enhanced with Blessed Moon-Beast Empowerment in magical abilities for two additional experience points. Experience spent this way is regained if the familiar dies. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar spends the entire training period in the same shape as that of the animal she’s training, she waives this Charm’s Willpower cost.
