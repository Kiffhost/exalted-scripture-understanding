Torch-in-Gloom Inspiration Stoking the ignited Burning Branch’s flames to unimaginable intensity, its wielder may pierce solid steel and burn even the imperishable magical materials. To use this Evocation, [[Torch-in-Gloom Inspiration]] must be active. She may supplement a disarm gambit, setting the targeted weapon ablaze and dealing a single level of lethal damage to its wielder on a success. Mundane weapons are completely destroyed by the blaze, while artifacts instead take enough damage from the incredible heat to render them unusable, breaking their owners’ attunement. Repairing the damaged [[Artifact]] is a superior project (Exalted, p. 241) with a goal number of half the total successes required to create it initially (round down). This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining positive Tie towards a family member by defeating an enemy who presents a formidable challenge in combat.
