*Plunging one of the Shatterbond Knives into her chest, the wielder strikes at her rival’s heart.*
To use this Evocation, the wielder must first use [[Gift of Pain]] on her rival, who must be within long range.
She makes a decisive attack against him by piercing herself with one knife, , striking through the bond between the blades. She makes the attack roll against her rival’s [[Resolve]] instead of his [[Defense]]. It’s penalized by his onslaught penalty and by her Rivalry.
In addition to being unblockable and undodgeable, this attack ignores cover, [[Hardness]], and similar physical obstructions. It can strike dematerialized foes or enemies who’re hidden from the wielder.
The attack’s damage uses the higher of the wielder’s [[Initiative]] or that of her rival, and adds (wielder’s strongest Tie toward her rival + rival’s strongest Tie to her) dice of damage. It deals aggravated damage.
Incapacitating him with this attack awards the wielder one [[Willpower]].
## Resonant
This attack’s range is unlimited as long as the wielder and her rival are both engaged in combat against each other.
## Dissonant
If the wielder uses her rival’s [[Initiative]] instead of hers to determine damage, it can’t exceed (her [[Initiative]] + Rivalry).
## Reset 
Once per scene.
