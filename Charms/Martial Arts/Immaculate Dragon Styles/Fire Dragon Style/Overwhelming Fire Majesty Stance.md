*The power and majesty of a raging conflagration cows even the bravest hearts.*
Flames wreathe the martial artist, imposing a penalty of (lower of Essence or Charisma) on attacks against her. Enemies that hit her from close range suffer one die of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. A foe may pay one Willpower to become immune to this Charm’s penalty for the scene, but not its damage. 
In Fire Aura, this Charm’s Initiative cost is waived and it loses the Perilous keyword.
