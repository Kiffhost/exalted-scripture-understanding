*The Infernal speaks, and the world obeys. Such is the rightful order of things.*

The Infernal adds (Essence) dice on a persuade or threaten roll. For each 10, she rolls an additional non-Charm dice. If she stunts her influence by overtly invoking a position of authority or power that she holds, she also rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 9.

The Infernal can’t use this Charm if her persuasion is too indirect — she must expressly make her will known, rather than subtly manipulating targets into unwittingly serving her. She likewise can’t use it when she’s openly bargaining from a position of weakness, like pleading for mercy from a foe.
