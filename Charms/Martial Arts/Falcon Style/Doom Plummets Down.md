*The stylist executes a signature finishing move that expresses her ferocious spirit in an unbelievable display of speed and power, flinging her foe to the ground before dealing the final blow.*
To use this Charm, she must have 5+ rounds of control over a grapple. After throwing an enemy into a hard surface, she lunges toward him and reflexively makes a decisive attack. Any stunt bonus awarded is also added to the damage roll, and if the throw was decisive, her [[Initiative]] doesn’t reset until after this attack. She can activate [[Raking Talon Kick]] reflexively to enhance it. 
If the stylist threw her enemy beyond close range using [[Neck-Piercing Hook]] or a similar effect, she leaps into close range with him before attacking. This counts as her movement action. 
## Mastery
If the stylist hits, she may reflexively rush the struck enemy or disengage from him with a leap, automatically succeeding on the roll. This doesn’t count as her movement action. 
## Terrestrial
This Charm can only be used against crashed enemies and is incompatible with withering throws.
