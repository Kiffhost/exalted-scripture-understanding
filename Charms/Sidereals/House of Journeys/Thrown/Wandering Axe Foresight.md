*The Sidereal frees her weapon to roam as it pleases, assured that fate will guide it to her enemy’s heart.*
The Sidereal makes a decisive attack against an enemy who’s at a location she’s been within the past hour. She doesn’t throw her weapon at him — instead, she’s revealed to have previously thrown a weapon, which only now appears to strike. Accordingly, the actual distance between the Sidereal and her target and any cover is irrelevant, and she doesn’t need to aim to attack at medium or even extreme range. If the Sidereal’s [[Initiative]] is higher than her target’s, he rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against her attack roll. If her fails, it becomes an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). This Charm can be used outside of combat. The Sidereal and her target rolls [[Join Battle]] to determine her [[Initiative]] for the attack’s damage and whether it’s an ambush. Anyone who subsequently examines the weapon glimpses a vision of the Sidereal — though this is vulnerable to arcane fate unless she’s wearing a resplendent destiny.
