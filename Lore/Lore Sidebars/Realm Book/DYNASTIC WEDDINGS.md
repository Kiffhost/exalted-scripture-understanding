Dynastic weddings are legal affairs rather than religious ones, presided over by an Imperial judge. The couple recites vows promising to support one another as well as the Realm, placing particular focus on producing Dragon-Blooded children. The bulk of the ceremony is a speech made by the judge about the benefits and responsibilities of marriage. After this, the union is blessed by a monk and celebrated with a lavish feast and celebration that lasts for hours to days, depending on the influence and resources of the coupleâ€™s families. 

Judges are scheduled well in advance and paid in jade; judges renowned for public speaking are particularly sought after. For judges who tire of court, this can be a lucrative semi-retirement.
