The stylist’s unpredictable footwork and nimble grace keep her just out of harm’s way.
When an enemy within close range attacks the stylist, she can clash with a disengage roll. If successful, she may move one range band away from her attacker, in addition to the usual benefits of disengaging. This doesn’t count as her movement action. She can’t clash undodgeable attacks.
In Rat Form, the stylist can clash attacks from enemies at short range.
