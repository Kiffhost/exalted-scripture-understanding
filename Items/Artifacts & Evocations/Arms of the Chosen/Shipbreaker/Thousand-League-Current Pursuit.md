Shipbreaker’s power rides the currents into the most distant waters. Activating this Evocation extends Draw to the Deep’s duration to Indefinite. So long as the motes remain committed, removing the bolt becomes a Strength 7+ feat, and the Exalt can trace the bolt’s spiritual wake, adding (Essence) automatic successes to tracking rolls against the encumbered target. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation.
