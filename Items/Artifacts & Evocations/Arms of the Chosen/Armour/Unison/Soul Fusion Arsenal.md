When the wielder enters [[Unison#Final Unity Mien|Final Unity Mien]], she fuses her readied weapons with her armor-body; her hand becomes an extension of her sword’s hilt or shield’s grip, just as the armor is an extension of her soul. She cannot be disarmed and treats the fused weapons as unarmed attacks for the decisive damage bonus of [[unison#Final Unity Mien|Final Unity Mien]]. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with moonsilver cannot awake this Evocation. 

## Resonant

The wearer can fuse a two-handed weapon to a single limb, letting her use it one-handed for as long as she remains in [[Unison#Final Unity Mien|Final Unity Mien]].
