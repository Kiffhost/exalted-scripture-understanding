Basic projects are the simplest tasks a craftsman can undertake, such as making a chair, forging basic tools, shoeing a horse, cooking a meal, or fletching an arrow. They normally demand little from the character in time or crafting materials. 
# Beginning 
To begin a basic project, the **character must have the proper tools, materials, and [[Craft]] Ability** to attempt it. These material costs are usually minor, as are the project’s time and energy demands. As such, **basic projects do not require the use of any project slots.** 
# Finishing 
The character must work for an amount of time deemed appropriate by the Storyteller, usually ranging from several minutes to several hours. Then, when the character is ready to finish the project, she makes an (Attribute + Appropriate [[Craft]]) roll against a [[Dice Rolls#Difficulty|difficulty]] set by the Storyteller. **Attempting to finish a basic project has no crafting experience point cost.** 
# Reward
Successfully completing a basic project grants the character **2 silver experience points** **per [[Crafting Projects#Objectives|basic objective]] triggered**. If the project was completed exceptionally well (the character’s successes were three or more higher than the project’s difficulty), then she instead gains **3 silver points per basic objective** **triggered**.
