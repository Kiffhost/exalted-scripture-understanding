*The Lunar stands as a living bulwark against even the most sweeping onslaught.*
The Lunar counts as protecting all allies within short range with a defend other action, even if she’s already using that action. If an area-of-effect attack targets at least one of her wards, her protection extends to all allies targeted by that attack, even those beyond this Charm’s range.
If the Lunar knows Quicksilver Guardian [[Defense]], she may pay a four-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s range to medium. If she knows [[Swift Den Mother Technique]] (p. 43), she may instead pay a nine-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s range to long.
