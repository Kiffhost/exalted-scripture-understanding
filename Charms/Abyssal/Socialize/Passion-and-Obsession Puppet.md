*Hungry for the dreams and passions of the living, the Abyssal obsesses over those unfortunate enough to catch her interest.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a successful read intentions roll, gaining a Minor Tie of fascination toward her target if she doesn’t already have one. She can’t voluntarily erode this Intimacy, and it can’t be weakened below Minor.
The Abyssal gains temporary specialties for that character in Awareness, Larceny, Presence, Stealth, and Socialize. If she acts against her Intimacy, she loses these specialties, though she can regain them by upholding her Tie.
