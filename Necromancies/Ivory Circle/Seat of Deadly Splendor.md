*A great fist of ancient bone bursts from the ground, arranging itself into a dolorous throne fit for a lord of the dead.*
While seated on it, she gains the following benefits against characters who can perceive her:
- The necromancer gains a bonus dot of [[Appearance]] and may choose to gain or suppress the [[Hideous]] Merit (Exalted, p. 162).
- She gains ([[Essence]] /2, rounded up) non-Charm dice on [[inspire]] or [[instill]] rolls based on awe, fear, or respect.
- Characters who wish to approach her must enter a Decision Point, spending one [[Willpower]] and citing at least a Minor [[Intimacy]] to do so.
- In combat, the pressure of her majesty is an [[Environmental Hazards|environmental hazard]] out to short range against all characters suffering this roll’s [[Intimacy]] with difficulty (necromancer’s [[Appearance]]), Damage 2i/round.
The withering damage dealt by this special hazard is unsoakable, but doesn’t award [[Initiative]] to the necromancer. If a character is crashed by it, he falls prone, bowing before his master.
The throne can be destroyed with a difficulty 5 feat of demolition requiring [[Strength]] 3. If it survives the scene, it fossilizes, becoming non-magical but permanent.
## Control
Any mundane seat transforms to fit the necromancer’s majesty, ossifying into elegant bone as she sits in it. While seated, she gains the spell’s usual bonus dice on [[inspire]] and [[instill]] rolls.
## Distortion (9)
The throne tightens around the seated necromancer like a fist, holding her in place until the start of the distorting necromancer’s next turn. She is immobilized and suffers a −3 penalty to all physical actions.
