*There may be no malice in the Yozis’ music, but the Green Sun Princes bring forth a new song.*

The Infernal’s song grants allies who can hear it the following benefits:
- Their withering attacks gain +1 raw damage.
- Against enemies with lower Initiative, decisive attacks add one die of damage.
- They gain one Initiative whenever they take decisive damage, as long as they aren’t crashed.
- Allied battle groups add two dice on rout checks.

If an ally has a wound penalty of −2 or worse, the withering damage bonus becomes post-soak and he always gains the decisive damage bonus. He gains two Initiative when he takes decisive damage.

The Infernal can’t take non-reflexive actions while performing.
