*[[Sekhem]] unleashes a conflagration of flame in which even divinity burns to ash.* 
This Evocation can only be used while its prerequisite is active. 
The Exalt makes an unblockable decisive attack that receives the benefits of [[Fire That Burns Flame]] for free. Its damage is (Heat + threshold successes), ignoring [[Hardness]]. This does not include the Exaltâ€™s [[Initiative]], nor does it reset her to base [[Initiative]]. An enemy damaged by the attack is set ablaze, suffering dice of lethal damage (or aggravated damage, for fire elementals and other fiery spirits) equal to ([[Essence]] + 10s on the damage roll), ignoring [[Hardness]], on each of his turns until the end of the scene. 
Extinguishing the flame without magic is a miscellaneous action that cannot be flurried, costs five [[Initiative]], and leaves the victim prone. As long as a fire elemental or other fiery being remains ablaze, it is permanently slain when incapacitated. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a non-trivial enemy with a decisive attack and building to [[Initiative]] 12+. 
## Special activation rules
This Evocation awakens at no cost when the Exalt faces a powerful fiery foe while [[Stronger Than Fire]] is active. 
## Resonant
Only a wielder resonant with jade can awaken this Evocation.
