Horizon Cleaver’s lightning submits to the wielder’s will. She’s mastered its mercurial zeal, gaining the following benefits: 
-  Horizon Cleaver doubles 10s on decisive damage rolls against thunderstruck characters. 
-  When she incapacitates a nontrivial enemy who’s thunderstruck, she adds (Essence) to her base Initiative upon resetting. 
-  Only 1s on her attack roll count towards losing control of Brilliant Reproach. 

## Dissonant

A character dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation.
