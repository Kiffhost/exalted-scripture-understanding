The Lunar beckons savage beasts and ferocious predators, rallying a terrifying horde from the wilderness. She rolls ([[Charisma]] + [Presence, [[Survival]], or War]) to call a battle group made up of animals of a species whose heart’s blood she possesses from within ([[Essence]]) miles. It assembles after (10 – Lunar’s successes) rounds in combat, or (20 – Lunar’s successes) minutes outside of it. Incredibly swift animals such as hawks assemble in a single round. The battle group’s [[Size]] depends on the type of animal called. Relatively weak animals, like squirrels, owls, or cats, form [[Size]] 3 battle groups; deadly predators and mighty beasts like tigers, yeddim, or bears form [[Size]] 2 battle groups; and super-predators like tyrant lizards and river dragons form [[Size]] 1 battle groups. The Storyteller may deem that circumstances like the environment in which the Lunar uses this Charm raise or lower the battle group’s [[Size]] by one. The battle group’s [[Drill]] is average unless it consists of pack hunters, in which case it’s elite. In combat, the battle group follows the Lunar’s order actions.Ifshedoesn’tguideit,itattackstheLunar’sfoesand follows her in pursuit of new enemies.

This Charm can’t summon other characters’ familiars, magically enhanced animals, or animals with negative Major or Defining Ties to the Lunar. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar uses this Charm in the shape of the summoned animal, she banks her rolled successes, which can be expended to add them to Charismabased command rolls targeting the battle group while she remains in that shape.
