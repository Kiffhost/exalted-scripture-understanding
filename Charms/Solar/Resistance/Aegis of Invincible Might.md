When her life is threatened, the Solar channels her fury to make herself nigh invulnerable. After using Adamant Skin Technique, the Solar’s hardness is raised to 20, and her withering soak is raised by her (Stamina + Resistance), while also cancelling (Stamina) post soak damage. This massive increase in toughness is based on a surge of Essence through the Solar’s body. In order to maintain it, the Solar must either unleash a decisive attack each round on her turn, or pay 8+ motes on offensive Charms. This effect ends if the Solar is crashed or fails to take continuous combat actions. Ride
