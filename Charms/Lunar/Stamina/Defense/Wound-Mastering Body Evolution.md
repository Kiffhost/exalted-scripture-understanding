*Those who can’t slay the Lunar with one blow may not be able to kill her at all.*
After suffering decisive damage, she can use this Charm to adapt to her attacker’s killing intent. She adds ([[Essence]] x2) natural soak against his withering attacks and ignores their Overwhelming rating, and gains [[Hardness]] 20 against his decisive attacks. The Lunar must pay one [[Initiative]] each subsequent turn to maintain this Charm. It ends if she’s crashed.
