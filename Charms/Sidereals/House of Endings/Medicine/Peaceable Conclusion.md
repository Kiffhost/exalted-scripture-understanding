The Sidereal reaches out to those who suffer or have lived beyond their time, bidding them let go of their attachment to their lives. The Sidereal touches a character who is either incapacitated or willing to die, killing him instantly and painlessly. His higher soul passes immediately into Lethe, his lower soul won’t linger as a hungry ghost, and his corpse can’t be reanimated as a zombie or other undead. If his corpse is ever placed on bare earth or stone, it sinks into the ground, arranging for its own burial. Once per session, using this Charm grants the Sidereal (Essence + 3) motes and lets her shed one Limit as she upholds the cosmic order.
