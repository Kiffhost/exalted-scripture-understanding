The Lunar’s familiars are a mercurial menagerie — she might conceal a tyrant lizard in her sleeves, or unleash a colossal centipede to overrun a city’s walls. While within medium range of a familiar enhanced with Blessed Moon-Beast Enhancement, she may reflexively activate Mountainous Spirit Expression (p. XX) or Tyrant Mouse Dominion (p.
