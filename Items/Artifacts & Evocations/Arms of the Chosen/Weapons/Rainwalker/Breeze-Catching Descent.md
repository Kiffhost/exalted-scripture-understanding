*Spreading [[Rainwalker]] wide, its wielder drifts gracefully through the air, dancing between raindrops.*
This Evocation reduces falling damage from any descent (Exalted, p. 232). Treat the fall as one range band shorter to determine the damage she suffers. If she protects another falling character with a defend other action, she extends this benefit to him as well. The wielder must be wielding [[Rainwalker]] to use this Evocation. Used together with [[Buoyant Guardian Aegis]], she must have a free hand to grab the parasol. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with Rainwalker, this Evocation awakens at no cost upon attuning to it. 

## Resonant

This Evocation reduces a fall’s effective distance by three range bands.
