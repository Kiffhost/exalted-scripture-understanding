While the Exalt sings, the Solar andeachallywhocanhearhergainasingleadditionalmote of Essence per turn in combat, if applicable, or one mote for every two minutes of song out of combat. Outside combat, Soul-Stirring Cantata can only be used once per day. While using this Charm, the Solar canâ€™t take any nonReflexive actions. Singing Soul-Stirring Cantata is guaranteed to draw the attention of local spirits, and members of the Wyld Hunt are trained to listen for the sounds this song produces. This song does not stack with itself when sung by more than one ally. Under the effect of Soul Voice, this Charm grants two motes per turn or per minute.
