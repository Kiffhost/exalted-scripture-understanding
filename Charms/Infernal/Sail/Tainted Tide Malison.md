*The Infernal invites the Demon Sea’s tainted waters to baptize the world anew.*

The Infernal transforms all liquid within medium range into acid for one scene, whether ocean waters or a bottle of wine. This acid is an environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 3L/round. The Infernal is immune, as are allies with Mother Sea Mastery or Ties of loyalty to her. Any liquid that enters this area is also converted, while liquids leaving it remaining acidic.

If the Infernal uses this Charm aboard a ship, this transformation extends out to short range from it. It lasts indefinitely, but acid that leaves the transformation’s range is quickly diluted by surrounding waters. In naval combat, she inflicts one die of Hull damage on a successful ram or boarding action stratagem. Enemy ships likewise suffer one die of damage if they succeed on such stratagems. (This stacks with damage from [[Acrid Slipstream Wake]]).

While using this Charm aboard a ship, the Infernal can sail into the Demon Sea over the course of a five-day journey, appearing at a safe location.
