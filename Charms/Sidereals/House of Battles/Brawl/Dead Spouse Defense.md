*There are oceans of blood yet to be shed in destiny’s service; what is one drop more compared to the Sidereal’s duty?*
The Sidereal can use this Charm after an attack roll against her or other roll to resist damage, but before the damage roll. She speaks the name of a trivial character she’s interacted with this story. She automatically defends against all damage or other harm from it; a few seconds later, that person’s heart stops.
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset by suffering Limit Break.
