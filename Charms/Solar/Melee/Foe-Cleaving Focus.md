The Solar’s existence is one of violence; she leads a life poised on the blade’s edge. Given that her life is one of strife and war, she must draw peace and clarity between swings of her blade. This Charm is triggered each time the Exalt uses Rising Sun Slash, awarding a mote for every 10 in the attack roll.
