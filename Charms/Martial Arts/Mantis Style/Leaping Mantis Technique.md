*The martial artist’s rapid footwork brings her within striking range before her foe can react.*
She rushes an enemy with (Strength) bonus dice.
If the rushed foe provokes her reflexive movement, she may move two range bands toward him instead of one. If this brings her into close range, she may reflexively make a decisive attack or grapple gambit against him, adding half the threshold successes, rounded up, on her rush roll as bonus dice on the attack roll.
If the rushed enemy does not provoke her reflexive motion, then on her next turn, she may make an unblockable decisive attack or grappling gambit against him (assuming he’s within her attack’s range), adding all extra successes from the rush as bonus dice on the attack roll. 
## Mastery
If the martial artist succeeds on the rush and lands an attack against her enemy, she gains one Willpower.
