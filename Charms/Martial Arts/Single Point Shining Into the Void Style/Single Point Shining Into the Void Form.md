*Sheathing her blade for a brief moment, the swordsman centers her mind and [[Essence]]. As she draws her sword once again and enters this form, it is as a lightning bolt of flashing steel, moving with unimaginable speed and control. While in this form, it is customary to sheathe one’s sword after each strike, and draw it anew for each new one—not merely as a show of this style’s formidable speed, but to contain and dissipate the overwhelming buildup of [[Essence]] that might erupt beyond the stylist’s control without such restraint.*
The first time the swordsman uses this Charm in a fight, she rolls her sword into battle with a ([[Wits]] + [[Martial Arts]]) [[Join Battle]] roll, giving it its own [[Initiative]] track separate from her own. This does not represent the sword gaining intelligence or agency of its own, but rather, the superior speed of the stylist allowing her to strike twice during each round. When the sword’s turn comes up in [[Initiative]] order, the swordsman may choose to make an attack with it, or to delay the action until later in the round. No other actions can be taken (including movement actions), and if the stylist does not choose one of these options, the sword’s turn is wasted. 
The sword’s [[Initiative]] is separate from the swordsman’s own—withering attacks made by one cannot add to the other’s [[Initiative]], and decisive attacks made by one do not reset the other to base [[Initiative]]. The base raw damage of decisive attacks made on the sword’s turn cannot exceed the swordsman’s own [[Initiative]], even if the sword’s is higher. When the stylist is dealt [[Initiative]] damage, the character who damaged her may choose whether to apply it to her own [[Initiative]] or the sword’s, but cannot split the damage across both pools. The sword also loses a point of [[Initiative]] at the end of every round it was not used to successfully land an attack.
If the sword’s [[Initiative]] is reduced to zero, then the stylist is forced out of this form, and cannot reactivate it again for three rounds. When she does, she does not reroll [[Join Battle]], but only sets the sword to base [[Initiative]]. If the swordsman leaves this form voluntarily before the end of the fight, note the sword’s current [[Initiative]] rating. If it is reactivated later during the scene, the sword’s [[Initiative]] is reset to this value, rather than making a new [[Join Battle]] roll. 
## Special activation rules
Whenever the martial artist achieves the highest [[Join Battle]] value at the start of a fight, she may reflexively activate [[Single Point Shining Into the Void Form]]. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood must pay a point of [[Willpower]] each round she wishes to attack twice. Otherwise, she may only make one attack per round, choosing whether to “use” her own [[Initiative]] or the sword’s each round. 
## Mastery
The martial artist gains the following benefits:
- When using the sword’s turn to make a decisive attack, its damage is not capped by the stylist’s own [[Initiative]].
- The sword does not lose [[Initiative]] on turns it did not successfully land an attack.
- If the sword’s [[Initiative]] is reduced to zero or less, the stylist loses the benefits of this form, but it still remains active. Once three rounds have passed, its benefits resume without the swordsman needing to activate it or pay its cost again. Additionally, if the swordsman crashes an enemy who reduced his sword’s [[Initiative]] to zero, then he may immediately roll [[Join Battle]] for it again and take an action with it on the same tick, as per the usual rules for [[Initiative]] Shifting (p. 194).
