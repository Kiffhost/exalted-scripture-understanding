Mortals denied destiny’s favor seek to make their own luck; the Sidereal is eager to assist, sporting colorful paper talismans and strange-smelling elixirs. The Sidereal makes a (Manipulation + Larceny) bargain roll to offer a character a phony good luck talisman, medicinal elixir, or similar piece of charlatanry, along with instructions on how to use it. Her target can’t use Intimacies of distrust, cynicism, or skepticism to bolster his Resolve or in Decision Points against it. If she succeeds, he must keep a good luck charm on him or display it in a meaningful place, take regular doses of a medicinal elixir, or otherwise make use of the talisman. If it’s depletable, he’ll seek to stay in stock, though not to the point of destitution. Affected characters will attribute any good fortune they encounter to a good luck charm — winning a hand of cards, surviving a bandit raid, discovering fresh water in desert, etc. Medicinal elixirs are instead credited for any improvements in an affected character’s health or significant physical or mental accomplishments. When such an event occurs, he forms a Minor Principle or strengthens reflecting the Sidereal’s instructions, e.g., “I must wear my lucky ring” or “I can’t eat fowl with my medication.” As long as he continues to use the talisman, he can’t weaken this Intimacy, though if an elixir or other depletable runs out, the Intimacy becomes vulnerable until he’s restocked. An affected character can only be convinced to take off or stop using a talisman if he suffers a great misfortune despite it; doing so uses the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221), requiring the victim to cite an Intimacy that’s equal or greater to the one instilled by the talisman. This frees him from this Psyche effect, even if he later resumes using the talisman. Absent such a roll, even the worst luck won’t make him doubt in the talisman.
