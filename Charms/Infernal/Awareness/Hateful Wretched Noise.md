*The Infernal becomes one with silence, sensing its antithesis with unparalleled sensitivity.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- She adds two dice on hearing-based Awareness rolls. The Storyteller should give her wide leeway in stunting incredible feats, albeit potentially at high difficulties, like hearing at frequencies beyond the human range.
- She can hear clearly out to 300 feet, or out to (Essence) miles for especially loud sounds, like a tyrant lizard’s roar or an army on the march.
- She ignores two points of penalty for trying to listen to quiet or muffled sounds.
- If she can hear someone yelling or a comparably loud noise, she counts as having a Minor Principle that supports silencing that noise by any means necessary.

This Charm lasts one scene for three motes or indefinitely for six motes, one Willpower.
## [[Keys]]
#### Let Silence Fall (Awareness 3)
The Infernal gains this Charm’s benefits permanently. However, if she can hear yelling or comparably loud noise, she must immediately silence it by any means necessary unless she spends one Willpower to resist, maximum once per session. If she does resist this compulsion, she suffers a −1 penalty on all actions until the noise stops.
#### Whispers Like Knives (Awareness 5, Essence 3)
The Infernal doubles this Charm’s dice bonus and penalty reduction. She can hear clearly out to a mile, or (Essence x 5) miles for loud sounds. If she kills a nontrivial enemy to silence his loud noise, she adds (his Essence/2, rounded up) to her base Initiative upon resetting. If the Infernal has [[#Let Silence Fall (Awareness 3)|Let Silence Fall]], she must spend Willpower to resist it each day, rather than each session, if that’s shorter.
