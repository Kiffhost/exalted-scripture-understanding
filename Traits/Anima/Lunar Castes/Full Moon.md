The moon’s radiance pierces night’s depths, illuminating unspeakable horrors that stalk their prey under cover of darkness. Though monsters may skulk in the shadows’ safety, the Full Moons will hunt them down wherever they cower, dragging them into the cold light of Luna’s judgement.

Implacable hunters and terrifying warriors, the Full Moons are Creation’s ultimate survivors and the [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]]’s warlords, their mighty bodies empowered by divine fury. No matter what shape they wear, they triumph over any obstacle in their path, whether rending foes limb from limb as a river dragon, scaling sheer cliffs with a mountain goat’s hooves, assassinating tyrants with a scorpion’s venom, or wielding a daiklave with superhuman might and speed in their own human shape. 

When the Lunars remade their Castes, they knew there’d be much bloodshed in the coming age, and made the Full Moons a Caste of peerless warriors with the might, speed, and endurance to slay any foe and guard the Lunars against those who’d hunt them. Full Moons are often their Circle’s greatest combatants, leading them in battle and protecting Circlemates from harm. 

Many who choose to become Full Moons are warriors, soldiers, hunters, athletes, bodyguards, hired killers, couriers, nomads, and others whose mortal livelihoods depended on physical prowess. Others aspire to the warrior ideal the caste embodies, coming from the ranks of revolutionaries, generals, zealots, strategists, or bold but untested youths. 

# Spirit Shapes

Full Moons tend towards spirit shapes symbolizing physical prowess, ferocity, or martial excellence. Often these are predators — bears, wolves, mustelids, birds of prey, sharks, snakes, great cats — but prey animals of immense size, endurance, or fearlessness, like aurochs and elephants, also find a place under the [[Full Moon]].

# Anima Banner

[[Full Moon]] Caste Marks are brilliant silver disks. Their anima banners begin as a steady, constant glow limning them in soft white or silver light, growing brighter and fiercer as they rise in intensity. Their iconic animas might depict their spirit shapes or monstrous forms derived from them, mighty weapons, vast silver-fanged maws, stylized war-banners, countless limbs radiating outwards, or similar displays.

# Anima Effects

Mighty warriors, the Full Moons’ animas suffuse them with physical power, bolster their will against fear, and grant incredible battle prowess (p. XX). 
- For five motes, the [[Full Moon]] adds ([[Essence]], maximum 5) non-Charm dice on movement rolls and feats of strength and gains (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) natural soak until her next turn. This is free at bonfire anima. 
- She adds (highest physical Attribute/2, rounded up) non-Charm [[Resolve]] against threaten rolls and other fear-based influence. 
- Once per day, when she lands a decisive attack that resets her [[Initiative]], she may pay 10 motes, one [[Willpower]] to roll [[Join Battle]], adding (highest physical Attribute) non-Charm dice.
