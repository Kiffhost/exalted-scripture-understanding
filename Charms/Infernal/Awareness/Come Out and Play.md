*The Infernal’s eyes widen with deadly excitement as she discovers a newfound foe.*

When the Infernal succeeds on an Awareness roll opposing the Stealth of an enemy within short range, she unleashes ribbons of crimson wind against him. This is a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 4A. If he’s damaged by the hazard, he must make a (Dexterity + Stealth) roll to maintain his concealment. Otherwise, the scouring winds leave him exposed, breaking his concealment.
## Special activation rules
This Charm’s duration can be extended as per the [[Infernal Awareness vs. Multiple Foes|Awareness Excellency]].
## [[Keys]]
#### Eager Demon-Wind Advance
The Infernal can also reflexively move into close range with her target.
#### Lonely Killer Wistfulness (+2i)
The Infernal can pay a two-Initiative surcharge to extend this Charm’s range to medium. Her victim’s 1s and 2s subtract successes on his Stealth roll.
