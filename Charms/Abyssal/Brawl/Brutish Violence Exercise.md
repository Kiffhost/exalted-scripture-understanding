*The Abyssal overwhelms her foe’s defense with sheer force, sending him reeling back.*
The Abyssal can use Strength instead of Dexterity on unarmed attacks and attacks with heavy weapons and to calculate her Parry with such weapons. This doesn’t benefit from effects that grant bonus Strength dots, double successes on Strength rolls, or replace her Strength with a higher value.
