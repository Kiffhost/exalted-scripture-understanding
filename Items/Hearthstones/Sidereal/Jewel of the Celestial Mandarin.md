This transparent, faceted square stone glows with a violet light. Any individual bearing it in an attuned hearthstone socket may glimpse the abodes of spirits—the doors of the sanctums where gods dwell become visible to her eyes.
Although this hearthstone doesn’t grant the power to enter such sanctums, she can speak and her voice will be heard within, booming with celestial authority—any command to come forth is treated as though it aligns with a Minor Intimacy.
