*Closing her eyes to the world around her, the Sidereal strikes where fate decrees she must.*
The Sidereal aims reflexively. This counts as a turn spent aiming for all purposes, including the aiming requirements of Charms like Ninth Direction Slash. An attack that benefits from this aiming ignores penalties from blindness.
Against enemies at close range, this Charm’s Willpower cost is waived.
