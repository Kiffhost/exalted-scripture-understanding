*The Lunar’s fangs rend the veil between worlds.*
For one tick, she may attack or otherwise physically interact with dematerialized characters. If she can’t perceive dematerialized targets, she suffers a −3 penalty on physical actions against them. While this Charm is active, dematerialized characters can physically interact with the Lunar — for example, with counterattacks or clash attacks. She can’t end this Charm prematurely to avoid this.
