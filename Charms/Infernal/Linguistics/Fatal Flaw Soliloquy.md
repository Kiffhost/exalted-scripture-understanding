*What bit player doesn’t dream of a chance to deliver a show-stopping monologue? The Infernal can’t allow such aspirations to go unfulfilled.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + {Linguistics, Performance, or Socialize}) persuade roll to convince a single character to talk about himself. Intimacies based on pride, arrogance, and the like always penalize his Resolve against this and increase their penalty by one.

If the Infernal succeeds, the target unwittingly reveals a piece of information she could use against him over the course of the conversation. If her influence is supported by a Minor Intimacy, he reveals something that’s merely inconvenient or embarrassing. With a Major Intimacy, he reveals something that could cause significant problems for him. With a Defining Intimacy, he reveals the most damaging information possible.

The Infernal gains a temporary specialty in all Abilities for exploiting this information. If the Infernal’s action takes advantage of one of the target’s Intimacies of pride, she also adds (Intimacy) dice on the roll. These extra bonus dice don’t apply on attack rolls or Shape Sorcery rolls.

Resisting this influence requires entering a Decision Point and citing a Major Intimacy to spend one Willpower. If the target has any Intimacies based on pride — even a Minor one — he must cite a Defining Intimacy instead.

The Infernal can only have this Charm’s benefits against one character at a time.
