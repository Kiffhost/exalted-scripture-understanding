*The Infernal gorges on filth and pestilence, becoming a garden for all manner of ills.*

If the Infernal succeeds on a roll against a disease’s virulence or a roll to recover from a disease she’s contracted, she can choose to retain the disease within her body, spreading it to others as usual. It’s impossible to diagnose her without magic like [[Plague-Savoring Palate]] that specifically enhances such rolls. Even then, these rolls suffer a –4 penalty. The Infernal can suppress the disease, letting her spare her allies from exposure.

When the Infernal successfully cures a patient of disease, she can commit one mote to make him a carrier, conferring the same benefits — except that he can’t suppress the disease. She can also do so when she inflicts a disease on a character, immunizing him against it while leaving him contagious. She can stack multiple uses to affect both multiple patients and multiple diseases.
This Charm doesn’t apply to incurable diseases like the Great Contagion.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has the [[Pestilent Apotheosis (Torment)|Pestilent Apotheosis]] feature, she can choose to substitute any disease she currently hosts for that feature’s standard disease when she enters her [[Devil-Body]].
## [[Keys]]
#### Plague Takes Root (Medicine 4)
Carriers remain contagious for (Essence + Intelligence) days after the Infernal releases her commitment.
#### Blossoming Pestilence Practice (Medicine 5)
1s subtract successes on rolls against the virulence or morbidity of diseases that the Infernal is hosting. Against characters she’s capable of eating, 2s subtract successes as well.
