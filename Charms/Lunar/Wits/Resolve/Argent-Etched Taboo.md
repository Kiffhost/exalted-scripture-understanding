The Lunar holds sacred the ways of her peoples, guarding them ferociously. When she enters a Decision Point after bolstering her [[Resolve]] with a positive Tie toward a culture, she may cite one of that culture’s customs as justification for resisting, treating it as an [[Intimacy]] with the same intensity as her Tie toward the culture. This Charm can only be used in defense of a given Tie once per story, unless reset by upholding that Tie by participating in one of the culture’s customs.
