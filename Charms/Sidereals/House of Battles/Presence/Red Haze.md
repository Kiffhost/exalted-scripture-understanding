Flecks of crimson starlight fall over the battlefield as the Sidereal makes the Lesser Sign of the Shield, marking fate’s foes for the world’s furious opposition. The Sidereal rolls (Strength + Presence) against the Resolve of all hostile enemies of fate within medium range. A character whose Resolve is beaten is surrounded by glittering crimson stardust, granting −1 target number on damage rolls against him and rendering him visible while dematerialized. Reset: Once per scene.
