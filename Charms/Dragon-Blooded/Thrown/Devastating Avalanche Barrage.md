Stones, debris, and clods of hard-packed earth rise up into the air around the Dragon-Blood and orbit her weapon as she focuses her Essence, building to an unstoppable landslide of force. She makes a withering attack against a single enemy, but also uses her attack roll as an unblockable withering attack against that foe and all characters within short range of him (including allies) as rock fragments and debris trail her weapon. If there’s no usable stone present, the Dragon-Blood may expend a level of anima to manifest it instead. After rolling damage normally for the first attack, she rolls (Strength) dice of unsoakable damage against each enemy hit by the second attack roll, although it cannot deal more damage than the first. She gains no Initiative from the second attack, but characters damaged by it are knocked prone. A character crashed by it is buried beneath rubble, and cannot rise from prone until he or another character has cleared it away with a Strength 3 feat of strength at difficulty (higher of Dragon-Blood’s Essence or Strength). This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully landing a decisive attack from Initiative 15+ while in Earth Aura.
