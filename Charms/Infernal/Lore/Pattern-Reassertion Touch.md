*The Infernal cannot abide seeing others twisted against her understanding of their nature.*

The Infernal touches a character and rolls (Intelligence + Lore). She can spend her successes to heal him of Derangements inflicted by the Wyld or Shaping effects for one success each. She can break ongoing spells or spirit Charms for a number of successes equal to the (Essence) of the character who used it. Alternatively, if an ongoing spell can be distorted, the Infernal can do so for only one success.

While using [[Systematic Imposition of Causality]], the Infernal adds its dice bonus on this Charm’s roll, and can use Pattern-Reassertion Touch against any character within her aura. She must make a difficulty 1 gambit with ({Intelligence or Perception} + Lore) against unwilling characters.
