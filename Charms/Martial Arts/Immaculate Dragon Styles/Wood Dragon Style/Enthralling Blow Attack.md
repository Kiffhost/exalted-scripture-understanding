*The Immaculate transitions through the undulating motions of her Unbreakable Fascination Kata into a sweeping blow that sends foes reeling.*
Upon using this Charm’s prerequisite, the Immaculate reflexively rolls a single withering attack against each enemy in close range whose Resolve she beat, even if they resisted with Willpower. She rolls damage separately against each hit enemy, but only gains Initiative from the highest damage roll. Damaged enemies cannot take any move actions on their next turn. An enemy crashed by Enthralling Blow Attack suffers the full effects of the Immaculate’s Unbreakable Fascination Kata until he recovers from crash, even if he’s already paid Willpower to resist. 
In Wood Aura, in addition to gaining Initiative from the highest damage roll, the Immaculate gains up to (Essence/2, rounded up) Initiative from each additional damage roll.
