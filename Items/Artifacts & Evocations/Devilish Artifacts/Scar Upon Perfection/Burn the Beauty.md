*Armed with skin-boiling acid, the Scar’s wielder strikes not to kill, but to disfigure.*

The wielder adds dice equal to her target’s Appearance on a decisive attack roll. Dealing damage inflicts a gruesome wound as a crippling effect. The target’s wound penalty subtracts successes instead of dice on Appearance rolls and is subtracted from his Appearance when determining how many bonus dice it adds on influence rolls. It’s impossible to conceal the wound with mundane means: bandages dissolve, cosmetics melt off skin, and clothing placed over it yellows, fades, and frays. This crippling effect lasts until the target has healed all damage in his health track.
This Evocation doesn’t affect Hideous characters.
### Dissonant
This effect ends after a day for characters with Exalted Healing.
### Resonant
A character whose wound penalty equals or exceeds his Appearance is left supernaturally wretched until he fully heals from the crippling effect. Other characters count as having a Minor Tie of either pity and disgust towards him, depending which emotional context fits their other Intimacies best.
