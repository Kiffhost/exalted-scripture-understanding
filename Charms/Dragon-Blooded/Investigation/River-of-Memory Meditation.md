The Dragon-Blood knows the criminal underworld as an angler knows the sea. After uncovering evidence or a clue that a crime has been committed, she rolls (Perception + Investigation) to correlate the details of the crime with what she knows of any character that she’s successfully profiled during this story, at a difficulty of (higher of his Essence or Larceny). Success reveals whether that character has a Major or Defining Intimacy that would have supported committing the crime. This doesn’t reveal what his Intimacy is or whether he’s guilty, only that he has a compelling motive. This Charm can also be used to recognize the signature method or calling card of a criminal, allowing the Dragon-Blood to instantly recognize a crime committed in the style of a character she’s profiled, and to distinguish his work from that of a copycat.
