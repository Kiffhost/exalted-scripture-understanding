A character who is bleeding out from his wounds can have the flow of blood stanched with an (Intelligence + Medicine) roll as a [[Miscellaneous|miscellaneous action]], with a difficulty equal to his current [[Health Track#wound penalties|wound penalty]] (minimum difficulty 1, maximum 5). A character treating his own wounds raises the difficulty by 1.
