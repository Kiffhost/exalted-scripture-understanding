*Rattlebones launches an enormous lance of saw-toothed bone, impaling foes with terrifying force.*
The wielder makes a decisive attack. Dealing 3+ damage to an enemy within close range of a solid surface or large object, like a wall or tree, he is pinned in place by the oversized bolt. He cannot take movement actions until he or an ally within close range pulls the barb free, requiring a [[Strength]] 3 feat of strength at difficulty equal to the total damage dealt, maximum 7.
While using [[Osseous Arbalest Graft]], the wielder adds up to ([[Essence]]) attack roll extra successes as damage dice.
## Resonant
This Evocation can pin enemies within short range of suitable surface, knocking them back one range band to do so.
## Dissonant
The difficulty to remove the barb can’t exceed the wielder’s ([[Essence]] + 2), maximum 7.
