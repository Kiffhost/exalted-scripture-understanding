Snarling fate with a twist of her hand, the Sidereal passes her pain back to her enemy. The Sidereal makes a ([[Stamina]] + [[Presence]]) counterattack against a decisive attack, rolling after her enemy’s attack roll but before the damage roll. It’s opposed by the initial attack roll’s successes. If she succeeds, one level of decisive damage that would be dealt to the Sidereal is instead inflicted on her attacker. If the attack deals no damage, it counts as having missed.
