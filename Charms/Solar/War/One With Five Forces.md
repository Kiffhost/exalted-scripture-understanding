The Solar general, having made many calculations and knowing her enemy as well as herself, is at one with the five forces. At harmony with the universe, the Solar cannot be defeated. This is the Charm of the Dawn Caste generals who tore apart and routed the invincible armies of the Great Masters in the Time Before. When the Exaltâ€™s battle group makes a successful attack against another battle group augmented by an order action, the Solar may use this Charm to take further control of the battle, forfeiting damage and using extra successes on the attack roll to place the enemy under the effects of a new stratagem. In literal terms, the Solar uses her superior knowledge and tactics to control the enemy army, forcing it into a disadvantageous state for the rest of the battle. The Exalt may instead use this Charm to erase a stratagem of equal or lesser value that has been used against her own forces, allowing them to escape from the most harrowing of disadvantages through her military genius. The Solar may deploy up to (Essence) additional stratagems with repeated use of this Charm. If any stratagems the Solar deploys seem incompatible, void the incompatible one and increase the severity of disadvantage in a pre-existing penalty. For example, an army trapped in a desert canyon is suffering from lack of water normally, but the compounded stratagem reveals that they are also sinking in quicksand. Increase penalties accordingly.

### On One With Five Forces

The backer wanted to expand the order action to make it more interesting and tactical from round to round. The backer also wanted the Charm to be Essence 4. His request ledtothecreationofthisbalancedbuttremendouslypowerful Charm that will greatly reward supernal War characters. Backer: Brent A. Nellis
