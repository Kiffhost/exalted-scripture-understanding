*When the Dragon-Blood successfully blocks an attack with [[Wrath-Grounding Guard]], she gains motes equal to the 10s on the attack roll, maximum (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) motes, strengthening herself with her enemy’s power.*
If the attack was made against a character the Dragon-Blood was protecting with a defend other action, she gains an additional mote.
With [[Melee]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, if the Dragon-Blood would receive motes from parrying an attack based on one of the five elements, she may instead forgo the mote reward and pay one [[Willpower]] to enter the Elemental Aura that matches the attack’s element.
