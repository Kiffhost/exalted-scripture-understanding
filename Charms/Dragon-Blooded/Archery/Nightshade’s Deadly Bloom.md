*Cruel thorns grow from the Dragon-Blood’s arrow, dripping deadly venom.*
To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 10+. If her decisive attack hits, it conveys a poison with Damage 2i/round (L in Crash), Duration ([[Essence]] + attack roll extra successes) rounds, and a –3 penalty.
An [[Archery]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Dragon-Blood pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use this as a Simple-type Charm, firing an arrow at any point within her weapon’s range, instead of targeting a specific enemy. The arrow grows into a thicket, exposing all characters within close range to a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty (Dragon-Blood’s attack roll successes) and damage (Dragon-Blood’s [[Initiative]] / total number of enemies, rounded up)L; those who take damage also suffer the poison above, with Duration 5 rounds. The thicket remains on the battlefield as difficult terrain for the rest of the scene; characters entering or moving through it are exposed to the poison. This resets the Dragon-Blood to base [[Initiative]].
