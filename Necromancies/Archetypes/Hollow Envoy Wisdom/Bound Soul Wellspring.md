*Once per scene, the necromancer may drain power from a bound or willing ghost at up to short range.*
She rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Occult]]) with (ghost’s [[Essence]]) bonus dice, banking one necromantic mote for each success. The ghost is left drained, suffering a −3 penalty to all actions for seven days. It can’t be drained again during this period. She may drain a hostile ghost possessing her as if it were bound.
