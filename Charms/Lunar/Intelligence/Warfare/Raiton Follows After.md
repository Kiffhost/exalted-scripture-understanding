Leading from behind, the Lunar guides her forces to red victory. Every 10 on an Intelligence-based order rolls an additional non-Charm die. If the Lunar orders a battle group to attack a crashed foe, she adds (Intelligence) bonus dice. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a Stamina Charm.
