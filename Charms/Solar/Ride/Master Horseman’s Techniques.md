The Exalt has the talent of a veteran equestrian, knowing a handful of ancient and proven techniques to control, console, and sustain her mount through the most arduous circumstances. Purchasing this Charm provides the Solar with three of the listed techniques, and the player may work with the Storyteller to expand the techniques available through this Charm. Additional techniques can be purchased for 2xp or a single bonus point. Harmony of Spirits Style: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to stop herself from falling off a mount. The Exalt can activate this effect when she is asleep, unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and will not fall off the mount from being asleep or otherwise unconscious during ordinary travel. Against any attack which might knock her from her mount, she gains +1 Defense. Horse-Summoning Whistle: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to call a loyal mount to her side. The mount makes its way to her as circumstances best allow. Master Horseman’s Eye: The Solar can spend one mote reflexively when evaluating a mount to perfectly recognize its strengths and weaknesses. Speed-Sustaining Technique: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively and touch a mount to sustain it for two hours. Effort during that time does not exhaust the creature, and it does not suffer harmful random incidents such as thrown shoes and injured hooves. Spirit-Steadying Assurances: The Solar can spend one mote reflexively to stop a mount from panicking. For one instant, the mount shakes off all natural or supernatural fear, and may not be intimidated by direct effort for (Essence) rounds, or indirect circumstances for the scene’s duration. Blood Rider’s Toughness: The Solar and her mount are as a single being with one skin. The Solar will never chafe or develop sores from long rides, and both the Lawgiver and her mount may ride for twice as long without food, water, or rest.
