*The Infernal sees the passions behind every deal like a kaleidoscope of synesthetic colour.*

The Infernal makes a special (Perception + Bureaucracy) read intentions roll against all characters she can perceive who are currently engaged in any kind of commerce or transaction — including theft. If she uses [[Hell Money Economics]] on the roll, she doubles 8s.

Success reveals a character’s intentions in connection with that transaction as well as his emotional state. If his emotional state is related to the commerce or transaction, she understands the connection, including a relevant Intimacy if he has one.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset when the Infernal engages in a meaningful transaction.
