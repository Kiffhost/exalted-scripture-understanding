Through mastery of [[Essence]] flows and a keen understanding of the body, the Solar can repair even the most ruinous damage at an incredible pace. The Solar spends fifteen minutes to an hour doctoring the patient, depending on the severity of the wounds. She still requires the normal medicines, bandages, and any tools that might be needed for more complex operations, but her results are nonetheless miraculous. Roll ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) with double 9s at the end of the treatment. This is the number of bashing or lethal health levels that will be restored if the patient remains in bed for the rest of the day. In addition, if the Solarâ€™s treatment would raise her patient two or more wound levels, she gains a point of [[Willpower]].
