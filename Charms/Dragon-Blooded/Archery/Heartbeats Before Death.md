*Sensing the interconnected web of life that surrounds her, the Dragon-Blood opens her eyes to deal out death.*
She may reflexively aim against a living or undead enemy before attacking it, and ignores any light or heavy cover it benefits from. If she already aimed the previous turn, she may attack an enemy behind full cover, though it grants him +3 Defense. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by aiming normally against an enemy before hitting him with a decisive attack.
