When the Dragon-Blood successfully asserts her [[Resolve]] against influence that opposes one of her Defining Intimacies, or successfully instills a nontrivial character with one of her Defining Intimacies using any social Ability, she gains a single point of [[Willpower]]. This Charm can only be used once per day.
