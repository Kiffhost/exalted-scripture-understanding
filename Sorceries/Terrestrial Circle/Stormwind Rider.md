*Bending the winds to her will, the sorcerer creates a servile dust devil to ride.*
The [[Stormwind Rider]] is treated as a flying mount (p. 202), although it cannot take the sorcerer to more than short range above the ground. ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) replaces the usual rolls for all combat movement actions. The whirlwind can carry up to ([[Essence]] x 2) additional characters, or one hundred pounds of cargo in place of a single passenger. While it cannot soar as high as the [[Cirrus Skiff]], the [[Stormwind Rider]] can travel at nearly 100 miles an hour and maneuver through forests or cities. In a race with other characters, the sorcerer rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]] + current temporary [[Willpower]]) for each interval. In combat, characters within the [[Stormwind Rider]] are treated as having light cover against attacks made from outside of it, and vice versa. A passenger who is crashed or hit with a decisive attack is knocked out of the whirlwind, and suffers falling damage if applicable. A sorcerer who knows [[Stormwind Rider]] as her control spell is buffeted by winds whenever she is beset by strong emotions. Sudden movements cause a small vortex powerful enough to scatter papers, upset furniture and topple someone caught off-guard. Her vertical leaps are buoyed by wind, allowing her to leap upward a single range band as her movement action; she can do so up to ([[Stamina]]) times before needing to rest. In addition, characters with an [[Essence]] pool gain access to the following powers while this spell is active: 
- Enduring Tempest (5m; Reflexive; Instant): Once this spellâ€™s duration has elapsed, the sorcerer may use Enduring Tempest to extend its duration for another hour. She may do so for as long as she has [[Essence]] to continue using this power. 
- Zephyr [[Rush]] (1m, 1wp; Supplemental; Instant): The sorcerer whips the [[Stormwind Rider]] into a sudden frenzy of speed, allowing her to move up to two range bands with a single movement action in combat or doubling 8s on one interval of a race. 

# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
Distorting a stormwind rider causes it to buck and swerve violently in its flight, threatening to throw off its riders. All characters carried by the whirlwind must succeed at a difficulty 4 ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) roll to maintain balance, although the sorcerer who cast it may substitute ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]). Characters who fail their roll fall out of the whirlwind.
