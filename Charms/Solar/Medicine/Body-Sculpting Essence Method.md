This Charm functions as Instant Treatment Methodology, but also lowers the convalescence of the Solarâ€™s patient to just seconds, allowing her to rebuild a ruined body and stand it upright in the time it takes to lace on boots. This Charm may be used once per scene, but can be reset by a two point Medicine-based stunt that does not involve Body-Sculpting Essence Method.
