*Death’s Lawgiver opens her students’ minds to knowledge beyond the ken of the living, imparting the secret wisdom of the void.*
The Abyssal trains a student, letting him incur [[Experience Debt]] to purchase dots of relevant Attributes or Abilities, up to a maximum debt of ({Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + [[Intelligence]]} x 4) experience. This can raise his trait ratings above the Abyssal’s own. The training time required is divided by (Abyssal’s [[Essence]] + [[Intelligence]] + 5), although the Abyssal need only spend a single scene mentoring her student during this time. She can use this Charm to train herself.
For every three points the Abyssal’s student incurs, she may weaken one of his Intimacies by one step if it opposes one of her [[Intimacy|Principles]] or negative [[Intimacy|Ties]]. He can’t voluntarily strengthen the eroded [[Intimacy]] until he suffers narratively meaningful consequences for acting against it.
A [[Lore]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Abyssal train up to ([[Essence]]) students with a single use of this Charm. Not all students need take the same traits, although the [[Storyteller]] may require her to stunt appropriate instruction for training widely disparate subjects. Alternatively, she can train up to ([[Essence]] x5) students, but halves the total [[Experience Debt]] each can incur, rounded down.
