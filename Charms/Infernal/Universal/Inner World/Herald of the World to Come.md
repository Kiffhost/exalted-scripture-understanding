*The boundaries of the Infernal’s inner world extend outward into reality, reshaping it piece by piece into a mirror of her soul.*

The Infernal manifests an aspect of her inner world as an eerie omen or an insubstantial, illusory presence within close range. Each individual feature that she manifests can be as large as a person — or as large as the Infernal, if she’s bigger. They’re obviously illusory and don’t block lines of sight or impede other senses.

If the Infernal is meditating on her inner world, she can pay a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to create a more substantial illusion, altering existing scenery out to medium range to fit the inner world’s aesthetics for the rest of the scene. A realm of bramble-strewn megaliths could make thorns and briars burst from the ground, while an inner world of darkness could dim light sources or snuff them out entirely.

This Charm’s range increases to short at Essence 2, medium at Essence 3, and long at Essence 5.
### Keys
#### Cosmos-Seizing Conquest Precept (Essence 3, [[Otherworldly Domain Cultivation]])
The Infernal can create substantial illusions without needing to meditate. They last for at least (Essence) hours, though some alterations may be permanent, at the Storyteller’s discretion.
