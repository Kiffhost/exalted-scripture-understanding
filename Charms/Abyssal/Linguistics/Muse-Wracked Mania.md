*The Abyssal composes faultless arguments and evocative verse, casting unneeded words aside.*
The Abyssal doubles 9s on a written influence roll.
A [[Linguistics]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase that requires any four other [[Linguistics]] [[Charms]] lets the Abyssal pay a one-mote surcharge to double 8s.
A third purchase at [[Linguistics]] 5, [[Essence]] 5 lets her pay a two-mote surcharge to double 7s.
