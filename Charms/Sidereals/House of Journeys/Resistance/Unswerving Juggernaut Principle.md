*Yellow stardust glitters beneath the Sidereal’s skin, hair, clothes, and eyes as she begins to run, writing her journey into the tapestry of fate.*
The Sidereal sets out traveling in a straight line, either by foot or by mount. So long as she continues moving in that direction, she gains the following benefits
- She ignores environmental penalties, fatigue penalties, and mobility penalties from armor.
- If an obstacle stands in her way, she may reflexively attempt a feat of demolition to destroy it.
- If she moves through an environmental hazard, its damage roll suffers +1 target number.
- She doesn’t need to sleep. She can gather whatever food and water she needs while moving without needing to roll, as long as they’re present in her surroundings.
- If changed circumstances render the original cause of her journey irrelevant or impossible, she makes a difficulty 1 (Perception + Resistance) roll.
Success reveals her journey’s futility. Every three threshold successes lets her asks the Storyteller a question about the change in circumstances.
If the Sidereal rides a mount, it gains these benefits as well.
This Charm ends if the Sidereal stops moving forward, diverges from her original course by more than 10 degrees, looks away from what’s directly in front of her, takes any non-reflexive action other than a movement action, or uses any magic that doesn’t enhance movement actions.
