*The Abyssal’s performance captivates her audience with an irresistible, if sickening, splendor.*
Characters who witness the Abyssal’s performance must listen or watch respectfully until she’s done.
They must pay one [[Willpower]] to leave before then, or two [[Willpower]] to interrupt the performance or initiate hostilities. Even if they resist, enemies find themselves drawn into the performance: their base dice pools cannot exceed their ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]), or their highest social pool for Quick Characters.
This Charm can’t be activated while in combat, but it remains active if hostilities break out in the midst of the deathknight’s performance.
With a [[Performance]] 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm on a performance that she watches.
Doing so lets the performer use the deathknight’s [[Appearance]] instead of his own if the rest of the audience can see the Abyssal.
Abyssal [[Performance]] vs. Multiple Targets [[Influence]] rolls enhanced by non-Excellency Abyssal [[Performance]] [[Charms]] ignore multiple target penalties.
