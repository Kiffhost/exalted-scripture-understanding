The Sidereal strives to mirror a spirit’s fate, becoming his reflection as he becomes hers. A roll to instill a single spirit with an Intimacy reflecting one of the Sidereal’s goals succeeds automatically — but in return, that spirit also automatically instills the Sidereal with such an Intimacy. Neither character can resist with Willpower, nor can they voluntarily weaken the instilled Intimacy unless they enter a Decision Point and cite another Intimacy of equal or greater intensity. Air elementals and other spirits associated with air must cite a Defining Intimacy in this Decision Point. Once one character has done so, both are free to weaken their Intimacies.
