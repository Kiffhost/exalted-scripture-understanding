Reality is a lie. Perception is a lie. The only truth is that which you choose. The stylist rolls her Initiative at a difficulty equal to the highest number of undamaged health levels possessed by any enemy. If she succeeds, combat ends as the crossroads of possibility unfold before her. The Storyteller and each other player can each propose a plausible outcome for the battle that relates to one of the stylist’s Intimacies, or another character’s Intimacy that’s directly relevant to the battle. Each proposed outcome must carry some meaningful consequence or cost that the stylist must accept, rather than giving an unconditional victory — except for the Storyteller, who can offer unconditional victory. Conversely, proposals in which the stylist is defeated or is unable to accomplish his goals must bring some benefit or reward commensurate to that setback. Example outcomes include: 
-  Just as the stylist seems to be on the brink of defeat, the tide is turned by the arrival of her beloved son and his reinforcements — but he’ll suffer a grievous, life-threatening injury. 
-  The fight ends in a draw as an even greater danger appears. The stylist and her enemies join forces against it, in accordance with her Principle of “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.” 
-  As she pursues her foe through his fortress-manse, the stylist comes across her trusted Circlemate, whom she came her to rescue — but in the time it takes to free them, her foe will escape.  
A nontrivial character’s player can veto him being incapacitated, killed, or harmed in a way that has long-lasting personal consequences, like suffering a crippling injury. Likewise, courses of action opposed to a Major or Defining Intimacy can be vetoed. Once everyone who wants to make a proposal has, the stylist’s player chooses one and briefly narrates how it unfolds — or can have the player who proposed it do narrate it. This experience is indescribable for those present in the scene. As the stylist contemplate the possibilities that lie before her, they all seem to exist simultaneously. Their understanding of reality begins to crack under the strain, until the stylist finally makes her choice, and they shatter. Enemies with Resolve lower than the successes on the stylist’s Initiative roll suffer the effects of Glimpse of Infinity. If the stylist doesn’t choose any of the options above, combat resumes, but her moment of indecision causes her to suffer from Glimpse of Infinity along with the affected enemies.
