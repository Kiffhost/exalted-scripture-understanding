The Lunar’s forces move unseen to strike at the heart of enemy armies, emerging like stalking beasts from the mist.
The Lunar rolls an [[Ambush]] stratagem with ([Appearance or Manipulation] + [[War]]), doubling 9s and ignoring penalties for poor [[Drill]]. If the total forces on her side are no greater than [[Size]] 4, she doubles 8s; if they’re no greater than [[Size]] 2, she doubles 7s. If successful, allied battle groups add (6 − [[Size]]) successes on rolls to establish concealment or take cover, weaving in and out of sight.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has Camouflage may learn this as an [[Appearance]] Charm.
