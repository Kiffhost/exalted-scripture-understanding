The Exalt moves her physical Essence around the flow of an attack, partially discorporating. For each 1 that appears in the result of an attack roll, the Exalt may pay three motes, converting that 1 into -1 success to the attack. Rumor of Form also acts as a Stealth attempt—as the Solar passes around the strike, she also vanishes in its wake. For every success the Exalt steals from her opponent’s attack, she gains an automatic success on a reflexive (Dexterity + Stealth) action.
