The Solar learns to defend others upon learning to defend herself. Like a pacing lion, she represents a formidable obstacle. The Exalt may take a reflexive defend other action to protect an ally within close range. This effect lasts a full scene, but only applies while the Solar and her charge are close to one another, and is cancelled if she moves out of close range. The Solar must drop commitment to this Charm to defend a different character.
