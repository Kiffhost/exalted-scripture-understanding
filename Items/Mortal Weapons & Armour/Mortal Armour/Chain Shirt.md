A [[chain shirt]] is a pullover shirt made from links of extremely fine mail. This garment protects the wearer’s chest, abdomen, shoulders and back. The armor’s sleeves reach only halfway down the upper arm. Because they are unobtrusive and can be worn beneath most clothing, chain shirts are common among those who have reason to fear assassins.
