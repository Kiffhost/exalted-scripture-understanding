*Filling her victim’s heart with bleak pessimism and rage, the Lunar awakens the primal darkness dwelling in his unconscious mind.*
Over the course of a few minutes’ conversation with someone, the Lunar makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Presence]]) instill roll. If successful, she beckons forth his shadow-mind, designed by that character’s player using the rules for [[Shadow-Mind Meditation]] (Lunars, p. 281). The Lunar also imposes a negative Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] or a pessimistic or skeptical Major [[Intimacy|Principle]] on the shadow-mind. The shadow mind immediately takes control.
If the shadow-mind tries to act against one of the victim’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he may enter a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], weighing that [[Intimacy]] against his shadow-mind’s strongest negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] or pessimistic or skeptical [[Intimacy|Principle]]. If his [[Intimacy]] prevails, he may pay one [[Willpower]] to regain control.
The shadow-mind still lingers once resisted. When circumstances support one of its negative Ties or cynical or pessimistic Principles, the victim must enter a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and cite an equal or greater [[Intimacy]] to spend [[Willpower]], or else the shadow-mind regains control.
Once a character has spent a total of (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) [[Willpower]] in these [[Decision Points]], the shadow-mind is permanently subsumed back into his subconscious, unless his player wants to keep it around.
Lunars with [[Shadow-Mind Meditation]] and others with alter egos of similar nature are immune to this Charm.
