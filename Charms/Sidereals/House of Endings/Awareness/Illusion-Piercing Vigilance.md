Shedding the scales from her eyes, the Sidereal realizes when she’s been compromised. The Sidereal rolls ([Perception or Wits] + Awareness) to detect a Derangement, Psyche effect, Shaping effect, sorcerous curse, or possession she suffers from. If an effect gives no difficulty for detecting it, use the Essence of an effect’s creator or the Guile of a possessing spirit. If successful, she gains −1 target number on rolls with any Ability to resist the identified effect and reduces any Willpower cost to resist it by one. Completely overcoming the effect counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX). With an Awareness 5, Essence 3 repurchase, success lets the Sidereal’s player ask the Storyteller if a character is responsible for the effect. If she’s correct, she can end the effect by killing that character. Spirits and the like must be destroyed permanently.
