A toast to old friends, a tempting appetizer, a welltimed joke — these provide all the opportunity the stylist needs. She may attempt an ambush (Exalted, p. 203) even in plain view of her target, seeming as though she’s simply carousing or engaging in conversation up until she plunges a needle into his throat. Instead of rolling Stealth, she rolls (Manipulation + Socialize), doubling 9s, against her target’s Resolve. If she succeeds, she uses the result of her roll in place of her Join Battle roll. As usual, if this is a higher Initiative than her victim rolls, her attack is an ambush; otherwise, it’s merely an unexpected attack. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully landing a decisive attack against the same target without being noticed by him or any other onlooker. It cannot be used to make an ambush attack against the same character more than once per scene, even if reset. 
## Mastery

If the stylist successfully launches an ambush, she doubles the threshold successes of a withering attack roll or adds up to (Guile) threshold successes on a decisive attack roll as dice of damage. This includes bonuses to her Guile from White Veil Form or other effects.
