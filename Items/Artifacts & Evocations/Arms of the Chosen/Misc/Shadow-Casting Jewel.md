A cage of moonsilver and soulsteel rings encircles this hen’s-egg-sized black Underworld diamond, cut beneath a lunar eclipse. Its bearer may pay ten motes, one Willpower and spend her entire turn reciting an incantation etched on its rings to call forth a flare of blinding light. The shadows thus cast by all other creatures within short range immediately come to life and attack their owners!

A shadow is rolled into battle with its owner’s Attributes, Abilities, and equipment — though lacking Charms, Evocations, and other magical abilities — and −0 health levels equal to the jewel-wielder’s Essence. Its only Intimacy is an unbreakable, unalterable Defining Tie of bloodthirsty rage toward its owner; social influence that would dissuade it from attacking its owner is unacceptable. A shadow loses its unnatural vitality if it or the character who cast it dies.

After use, the Shadow-Casting Jewel must be recharged by an entire night’s exposure to the new moon’s unlight before it can be activated again.
