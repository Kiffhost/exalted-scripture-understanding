The Lunar’s words poison the soul, twisting the heart against itself. When she makes an instill roll to weaken a single character’s [[Intimacy]], he can’t use that [[Intimacy]] to bolster his [[Resolve]] — instead, it penalizes his [[Resolve]] as though it supported the influence. This Charm can only be used against a character once per story. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar uses this Charm in a shape that’s the object of the targeted [[Intimacy]], resisting the influence requires entering a Decision Point and citing a different [[Intimacy]] whose intensity equals or exceeds that of the targeted [[Intimacy]].
