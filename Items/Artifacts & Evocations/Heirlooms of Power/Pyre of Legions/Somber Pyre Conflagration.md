The wielder’s anima banner burns away in the crucible of the Pyre, leaving in its place a towering inferno that can be seen for leagues. Battle groups don’t add their [[Size]] to attack rolls or damage against the wielder, and treat her as a battle group of [[Size]] (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Strength]]) to determine whether they can move past her without disengaging (Exalted, p. 209). She waives the health level cost of [[Army-Routing Aegis]] while this Evocation is active. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with jade, this [[evocation]] awakens at no cost when she upholds a Major or Defining Tie of loyalty when confronting a significant threat alone.
