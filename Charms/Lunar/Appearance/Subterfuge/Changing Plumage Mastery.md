The Lunar shifts her semblance to suit her needs. She may reflexively invoke any of the following benefits: Faceless Trickster Approach: The Lunar assumes a forgettable countenance, imposing a −2 penalty on Investigation rolls to ascertain her identity. Characters who haven’t met her personally but have seen her in passing can’t remember doing so, finding her unremarkable. Ogre-Prince Inversion: The Lunar gains the Hideous Merit (Exalted, p. 162). If she already has it, she may instead suppress it. Seven-Colored Silkworm Flourish: The Lunar alters the appearance of worn mundane clothing and accessories as a miscellaneous action, or reflexively when she shapeshifts. This usually requires no roll, though assuming particularly lavish outfits or imitating bespoke clothing might require an (Appearance + Craft) roll. The clothing reverts to its true form if removed. Stolen Scent Perfume: The Lunar can commit two motes to replace her body’s scent with that of any form she possesses. The substitution is perfect, as though she’d changed into that shape (p. XX).
