*Her sense for violence honed by training and tempered by self-discipline, the Immaculate draws her blades without needing to think.*
She rolls [[Join Battle]] twice, taking the higher of the two results. Any [[Charms]] she uses must be paid separately for each roll. If she wins [[Join Battle]] and makes a decisive attack on her first turn, she adds ([[Dexterity]]) attack roll extra successes as dice of damage.
