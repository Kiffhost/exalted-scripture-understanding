*The Abyssal’s heart-rending melody revives long-ago griefs and sorrows, shattering the tombs in which they lie buried.*
The Abyssal can pay a five-mote surcharge when she uses [[Soul-Crushing Dirge]] to let it target Intimacies that a target once held, but no longer has, treating their intensity as whatever it was at its highest. She can choose to exclusively target such Intimacies, or simply add them to the range of options. If the [[Storyteller]] hasn’t kept track of a character’s Intimacies, he should assign one that fits a character’s backstory.
Similarly, if this influence exploits an existing [[Intimacy]] that a target once held at a higher intensity, it’s raised to that intensity against the Abyssal’s roll and for roleplaying purposes in determining how the character acts on the inspired emotion.
