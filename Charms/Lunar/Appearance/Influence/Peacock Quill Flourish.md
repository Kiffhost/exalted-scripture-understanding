The Lunar’s elegant calligraphy beckons memories of her radiant visage to her reader’s mind, swaying him with the indelible impression she’s left. She adds bonus dice from Appearance (Exalted, p. 218) on a Charisma- or Manipulation-based influence roll made through writing, the Infallible Messenger spell, or similar means of communicating without being seen. The influence’s target must have previously seen the Lunar — either in her true form if she writes as herself, or in the shape of the person she claims to be.
