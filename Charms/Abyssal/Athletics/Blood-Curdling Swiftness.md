*The Abyssal lunges for her victim with inhuman speed, a gruesome nightmare too swift to escape.*
The Abyssal treats a successful rush as a threaten roll against her target. If successful, he must use his next turn to flee the deathknight or otherwise seek safety, suffering a −3 penalty on movement actions opposing her until that turn ends. This costs one Willpower and (Abyssal’s Essence) Initiative to resist.
With Athletics 5, Essence 3, the Abyssal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s influence to all enemies who witnessed the rush.
