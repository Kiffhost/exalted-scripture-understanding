The Infernal moves by vanishing through shadowy portals, transforming into a bolt of viridian lightning or otherwise flashing instantly to her destination. This has the following benefits:
- She can take reflexive move actions by teleporting without crossing the intervening space, avoiding difficult terrain, hazards, walls, or any other obstacle that would constrain her movement.
- She can take a miscellaneous action to move to a location within medium range without crossing the space between. This uses her movement action.
- She adds two non-Charm successes on any opposed movement rolls.
