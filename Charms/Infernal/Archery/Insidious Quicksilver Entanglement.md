*Creeping metal vines extrude from the Infernal's arrow to entangle her foe in a bramble of mirrors.*

If the Infernal deals damage with a decisive attack, her target suffers a -1 penalty on all physical rolls that would be impeded by his entanglement, and to his Evasion and Guile. At the start of each of the victim's turns, the penalty on his rolls (but not his static values) increases by one, maximum -5.

If the Infernal knows one of her target's Intimacies, she may root the arrow's growth in it, adding (Intimacy/2, rounded up) to the starting penalty on rolls and the maximum penalty.
The vines be removed with a gambit at a difficulty of (current penalty + 3).
