A player can upgrade a mutation she already possesses with mutation-granting [[Charms]] by allocating dots equal to the difference between her current rating and the new one. If a hawkwoman Lunar uses [[Hybrid Body Transformation]] to upgrade her three-dot [[Wings]] to five-dot [[Wings]], that only count as two dots of mutation.
