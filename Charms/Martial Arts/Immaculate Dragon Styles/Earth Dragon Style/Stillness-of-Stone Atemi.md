*The staggering force of the Immaculate’s blow teaches her enemies what it is to bear the world’s weight.*
Her withering attack gains +1 Overwhelming. For each 10 on the damage roll, the Immaculate may pay one [[Initiative]] to raise her foe’s mobility penalty (Exalted, p. 591) by one until the end of his next turn, maximum ([[Essence]]). An enemy crashed by the attack suffers this penalty until he recovers from crash, if that’s longer.
In Earth Aura, the Immaculate may also pay [[Initiative]] for 9s on her damage roll to inflict penalties.
