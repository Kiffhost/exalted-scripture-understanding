*After successfully using the prerequisite, the Exalt’s Offhand Charge surges.*
When she moves forward in a response to the opponent moving away, she may activate this Charm reflexively at the end of her motion. Crossing her blades, the Steel Devil draws them apart with impossible speed, blistering the air with a razor-sharp arc of force that hits all targets in front of her out to medium range with a decisive attack that has damage equal to her current Charge. This attack does not include the Exalt’s current Initiative, nor does it reduce her to base Initiative. 
## Terrestrial
A Terrestrial’s Sonic Slash only reaches out to short range.
