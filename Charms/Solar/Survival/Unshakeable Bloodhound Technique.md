The Solar can track someone through the wilderness following the most minute signs, or sometimes no sign at all, following unerring instinct. This Charm supplements the (Perception + Survival) roll described on page 229. Reroll all 5s and 6s until 5s and 6s no longer appear, and treat 1s rolled by the opposing player as 10s on the Solarâ€™s result. This Charm can even contest perfect track-covering effects such as Traceless Passage.
