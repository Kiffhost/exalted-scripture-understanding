This elegant hand mirror has a reflective surface of polished orichalcum set in a moonsilver frame. Attuned by committing five motes, its reflection reveals the truth behind false images. This is automatically successful against mundane disguises. Against magical disguises and illusions, the mirror’s bearer gains ([[Essence]]) bonus successes on the roll to oppose them. If the effect doesn’t provide a way of rolling to see through it, she may instead roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against a difficulty of its user’s ([[Essence]]) to see through it. 

Spending five motes and one [[Willpower]], the bearer can confront a cloaked character with the mirror at close range, showing him his own true image. This requires a successful ([[Wits]] + [[Presence]]) roll against the target’s [[Guile]]. If successful, illusion magic veiling that character shatters like glass, mundane disguises melt away, and personas (Exalted, p. 400) and similar magical alternate selves are forced into dormancy for the rest of the scene. If any of the target’s [[Intimacy#Principles|Principles]] go against something she knows to be true, they are inescapably revealed as false, allowing the target to discard them entirely if she wishes. This can only be used on a character once per scene. 

The mirror cannot reveal or impede physical shapeshifting, as that is the truth of the target’s appearance, nor the resplendent destinies woven by Sidereal Astrology.
