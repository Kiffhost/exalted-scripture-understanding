*The Dragon-Blood reaches into the pages of a manuscript as though they were flowing water, plumbing its depths to commune directly with the wisdom it contains.*
She can absorb and comprehend the contents of a book or other record of information, such as a mural or coded tattoo, in only a handful of minutes as though she’d read it completely. This doesn’t allow her to understand information in a language she cannot read. If she uses this Charm on an exotic repository of wisdom, such as a gemstone enchanted with a sorcerer’s memories, the Storyteller may require a ([[Perception]] + [[Lore]]) roll to comprehend its contents. This Charm can be used in conjunction with [[Flawless Study Focus]] to waive the normal time requirement for using it. Once the Dragon-Blood finishes reading a text or similar document, she may roll ([[Manipulation]] + [[Lore]]) to siphon away its wisdom, removing crucial facts and key details to prevent subsequent readers from discovering useful information by reading it. The target and intention of written social influence cannot be altered. A reader may recognize that the text has been altered with a ([[Perception]] + {Linguistics or Lore}) roll opposing the Dragon-Blood’s result, but this doesn’t reveal what was erased. This alteration can be undone by another character with a use of this Charm or similar magic, such as [[Flashing Quill Atemi]] (Exalted, p. 326), requiring an opposed ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]) roll.
