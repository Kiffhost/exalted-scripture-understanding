*Paralyzing dread wafts from Gorgon’s blade like heat haze.*
A successful withering attack supplemented by StoneSinew Offensive weighs down the target’s limbs like lead, imposing a −1 penalty to attack rolls, all forms of mobility, and [[Defense]] until the end of the wielder’s next turn. Multiple uses of this Evocation stack their penalty, extending its duration by one turn with each successful hit. If the wielder doesn’t hit that enemy with [[Stone-Sinew Offensive]] before the end of her next turn, the penalty is reset. LULLABY FOR A DEVIL BLADE A sufficiently compelling performance can lull the creature within [[Gorgon]] into complacency. This is an extended ([[Performance]] + [[Charisma]]) miscellaneous action with a difficulty of the wielder’s permanent [[Willpower]], a goal number of 30, an interval of one turn, and a terminus of (10 − wielder’s [[Essence]]). If a performer succeeds on a roll with 5+ threshold successes, Gorgon’s Wakefulness falls by one step, but a botch resets Gorgon’s Wakefulness to the highest point it held this scene. If the performer meets the goal number by the terminus, [[Gorgon]] falls completely asleep and cannot be roused this scene by any means. Failure restores its Wakefulness to its highest point this scene, and it can be lulled no further for the rest of the day.

An enemy in [[Initiative]] Crash while suffering from [[Stone-Sinew Offensive]] cannot take movement actions.
