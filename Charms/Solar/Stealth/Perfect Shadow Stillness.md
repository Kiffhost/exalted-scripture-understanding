The Lawgiver’s stealth technique is honed until it’s flawless. Perfect Shadow Stillness allows a reroll of any Stealthbased action, preserving the 10s from those results and rerolling the remaining dice. At Stealth 5, succeeding at a stealth attempt with this Charm awards the Solar one point of temporary Willpower.
