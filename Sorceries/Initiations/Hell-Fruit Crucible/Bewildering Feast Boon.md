Once per day, The sorcerer can draw power from gorging herself on hellish flora or other strange reagents that are inedible to most humans. She rolls (Stamina + Occult), gaining sorcerous motes equal to the successes. These sorcerous motes last for (Essence + Stamina) days or until she next uses this ritual. Collecting a week’s worth of suitable fare takes a few hours and requires a difficulty 4 (Intelligence + Survival) roll, or a difficulty 2 roll in Malfeas.
