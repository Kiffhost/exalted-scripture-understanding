*Using an appropriate [[Craft]] such as Craft (Masonry) or Craft (Scrimshaw), the necromancer may craft a necromantic effigy as a basic project at difficulty 2.*
Success grants two necromantic motes, which last for the remainder of the story. Within medium range of a necromantic effigy, she may reflexively draw three necromantic motes from it, which last for the rest of the scene, destroying the effigy. If completed as a [[major project]] at difficulty 4, the effigy endures; motes may be drawn from it in this manner once per scene instead of destroying it. If used for her control spell, this doesnâ€™t count against her once per scene limit.
