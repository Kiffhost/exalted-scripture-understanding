Walking the coiling path of time, the stylist puts the distance of seconds between herself and her foes. If the stylist is hit by an attack or suffers from another harmful power, its effects doesn’t take place immediately — instead, it’s delayed until the end of the round. This includes Psyche effects, but not other social influence. She doesn’t suffer any effects used by characters she crashes or incapacitates before the end of the round. If the stylist crashes or incapacitates the enemy who used one of the delayed effects, that effect is negated entirely. Enlightenment: The stylist can negate an effect by landing an attack that deals 5+ withering damage or 3+ decisive damage to the enemy who used it. Reset: Once per scene unless reset by negating a delayed effect used by an enemy whose strength is comparable to or greater than the stylist’s.
