Merchant princes transport their most fragile goods in these white jade boxes, while scavenger lords unearthing them in ancient ruins tremble with hope at what fabulous First Age riches they might contain. Lined with rainbow skins from immortal seven-colored serpents of the uttermost East, each is virtually indestructible, and their contents — from delicate glassware to ancient crumbling scrolls — share their nigh-indestructibility.

While the coffer is closed, even the roughest treatment or most extreme temperature leaves its contents undamaged. Breaking the coffer is a [[Strength]] 10+ feat, at difficulty 15 to slowly bash through or difficulty 20 to smash it open with one blow. Its magic doesn’t ward off decay; ripe fruit won’t bruise within but will go rotten.

Coffers range in size from petite jewel-boxes to a Dynast’s traveling trunk. Each opens to a jade key, though keys to First Age coffers are usually long lost. Picking a coffer’s lock is difficulty 7; making a new key is a major repair project requiring [[Craft]] ([[Artifact]]).
