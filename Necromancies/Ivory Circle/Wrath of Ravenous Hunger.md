*Calling to her foe’s lower soul as one might lure a hungry dog with bloody meat, the necromancer grants it greater sway.*
The necromancer makes a special ({Manipulation or Intelligence} + Occult) influence roll against a living character within medium range. Success rouses his lower soul, filling him with violent urges and insatiable hunger. He suffers a −(higher of necromancer’s Essence or 3) penalty to all rolls requiring a level head or careful foresight. The amount of food he must consume to avoid starvation is multiplied by (necromancer’s Essence + 2), and he can only sustain himself on meat. Others may exploit these urges and hunger as if they were a Major Intimacy. If such an influence roll fails, the cursed character automatically gains a negative Minor Tie toward the influencing character.
Characters who die while cursed always leave a hungry ghost if able.
Alternatively, the necromancer can use this spell against the undead, even when they lack a lower soul, strengthening the vestigial echo of their hunger. Her target may use the traits of a hungry ghost (Exalted, p. 503) if they’re superior to their own and gains the Blood Scent and Earthbound Merits — though not the increased damage from sunlight. Such undead thirst for living blood, suffering deprivation penalties if they go more than (their Essence + 2) days without it (Exalted, p. 232).
## Control
Starving characters double their deprivation penalty while in medium range of the necromancer.
Hungry ghosts count as having a Major Tie of respect for her. Whenever she passes by an unburied corpse, it groans uncontrollably with an echo of hunger.
## Distortion (10)
So long as the target can satisfy their increased appetite, he reduces the penalty on rolls by two, and his hunger only counts as a Minor Intimacy.
