Recognizing subtle patterns and hidden meanings, the Lunar discerns concealed truths. She can read a page of text in a second, and longer texts in one to ten minutes, depending on length. If she rolls to decipher a code or recognize a written forgery while reading, she rerolls ([[Perception]]) failed dice. This can contest [[Charms]] such as Letter-Within-a-Letter Technique (Exalted, p. 323). Alternatively, she rerolls ([[Perception]]) failed dice on a read intentions roll against a character whoâ€™s deliberately using abstruse language or circumlocutions to conceal his true motives or [[Intimacy|Intimacies]].
