*The tall grass’ music grows louder as the wind blows through it, mounting to a dramatic crescendo. Hearing this song and moving to its rhythm, the dancer achieves an incomparable battle rhythm.*
She gains (lowest of Appearance, Manipulation, or Performance) Evasion. If she can hear music from another character or source, she adds the highest instead. If she dodges, and the attack rolls fewer successes than this Charm’s Evasion, her attacker resets to base Initiative. 
Alternatively, the dancer can employ the technique named Serval Leaps from Tall Grass to reflexively clash an attack from close range with a decisive attack. If she can hear music from another character or source, she adds her enemy’s 1s on the attack as dice of damage. 
## Mastery
The dancer can use Serval Leaps from Tall Grass to clash ambushes. 
## Terrestrial
Serval Leaps from Tall Grass counts as the dancer’s attack for the round.
