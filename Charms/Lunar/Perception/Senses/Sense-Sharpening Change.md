The Lunar shifts her body to hone one of her senses. She chooses a single sense, rerolling 1s until they cease to appear on [[Perception]] rolls using it, and ignoring ([[Essence]]) points of penalty from overstimulation or understimulation of that sense even on non-[[Perception]] rolls. She could ignore penalties to vision caused by darkness or blinding light, but not by fog or distance. The Lunar may stack this Charm to enhance different senses. The cost of activations beyond the first is reduced to one mote.
