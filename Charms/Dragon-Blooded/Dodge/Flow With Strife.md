The Dragon-Blood’s movements are fluid and shapeless, adapting to whatever force is directed against her. Even when struck she may be unscathed, flowing with her enemy’s attack rather than against it. After the damage roll of a decisive attack that the Dragon-Blood attempted to dodge, she can use this Charm to negate damage successes at a cost of three Initiative per level of non-aggravated damage. If she completely negates the damage of an attack, it seems that she was struck, but she flows away from the attack at the last second; this counts as dodging the attack. The Initiative cost of this Charm is discounted to two Initiative per level of damage while the Dragon-Blood is at least ankle-deep in water or fighting in driving rain.
