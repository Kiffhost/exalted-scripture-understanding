*The Abyssal works like a woman possessed, shaping molten iron with her bare hands and forging masterpieces in a single, sleepless night.*
The Abyssal undertakes a basic or major project without needing tools or a workshop and completes it with incredible speed. Most can be finished in seconds or minutes if she has all the necessary materials. The most arduous, work-intensive projects can be completed in an hour if basic or a day if major.
With a Craft 5, Essence 2 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a four-mote, one Willpower surcharge to use this Charm on superior and legendary projects. Such uses aren’t Mute. Such projects are typically completed within (6 – Essence) weeks, though five-dot or N/A artifacts and manses take that many months instead.
This doesn’t speed tasks not directly related to using Craft, like gathering resources or recruiting laborers.
This limit most often applies to manse construction — under typical conditions, they still take at least a season to complete.
