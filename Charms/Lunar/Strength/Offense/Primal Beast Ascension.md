*Drawing forth ancient power, the Lunar takes on the monstrous shape of a primal beast.*
The Lunar can use [[Deadly Beastman Transformation]] while in an animal shape to transform into a primal form of that animal. This doesn’t use [[Hybrid Body Transformation]] or confer mutations. Her animal form’s natural prey count as having a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward her. Familiars, other magically enhanced animals, and non-animal prey only count as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]].
[[Deadly Beastman Transformation]] doesn’t end if the Lunar shifts into another animal shape, or if she returns to her human shape and immediately uses [[Hybrid Body Transformation]].
Special Activation Rules: Whenever the Lunar uses [[Towering Beast Form]] or [[Mountainous Spirit Expression]] in an animal shape, she may use [[Deadly Beastman Transformation]] reflexively with this Charm.
