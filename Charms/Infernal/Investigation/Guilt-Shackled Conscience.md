*The Infernal’s quarry can feel her relentless pursuit like a whisper at the back of their mind, a promise of the reckoning to come.*

When the Infernal succeeds on a profile character roll, she also treats it as a special influence roll against her target. He hears a distant, seemingly sourceless sound: a hissing static at the edge of hearing, the ominous tolling of bells, the Infernal’s eerie laughter. If the Infernal succeeds, her victim is overwhelmed with dread and fear of discovery, suffering Minor Paranoia (Exalted, p. 169). Whenever possible, the target isolates himself, avoids conflict and public appearances, and refuses to take actions that might draw significant attention to himself. He fears the sun — green or otherwise — and avoids bright light. His paranoid behavior paradoxically puts him at greater risk of discovery, inflicting −2 Guile.

If the Infernal’s victim wishes to act in defiance of his fear, he must spend one Willpower by entering a Decision Point and citing an Intimacy with an intensity that equals or exceeds that of his Paranoia. Once he’s done so (Infernal’s Essence) times, he’s freed from his Paranoia.

If the Infernal uses this Charm together with [[Exquisite Trespass Connoisseur]] after she’s uncovered a secret with that Charm, her victim’s paranoia centres around ensuring that it remains secret or checking that it’s secure. The Guile penalty he suffers increases by one against rolls that might expose the secret.
