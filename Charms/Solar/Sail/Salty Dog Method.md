The Solar is the consummate mariner, seasoned by hardships, tried by adversity and proven true. This Charm gives the Exalt the following advantages: •	 The Solar’s expertise often saves the ship. Reroll any 6s in the result of a Sail roll until 6s no longer appear. •	She is inured to supernatural horror. Fear effects caused by monsters, behemoths, demons, Yozis, and other existentially terrifying beings have less of an effect. Add half the Exalt’s Sail (rounded up) to her Resolve against such influence. •	 If she fails a balance check on land or sea, she still falls down, but then she immediately falls up, landing on her feet. In addition, she can never fall from a ship. Even the most stumble-footed bastard will find a way to keep from going overboard. •	 By land or by sea, the Exalt knows the exact distance and route to anywhere she’s been before.
