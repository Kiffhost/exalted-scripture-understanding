*Tossing a leaf, petal, or fruit into a body of water, the sorcerer beckons it with mudras of the turning seasons to grow into a small, seaworthy craft.*
This is a #ship with the following traits:
- [[Ship Speed]]: Magically impelled +2; current +1; oars +1; empty cargo hold +1 -
- [[Maneuverability]]: +3;
- [[Hull]]: −1/−2/−4/Incapacitated 
- Cargo: One ton. The ship can comfortably carry a half-dozen passengers. 
Upon casting this spell, the sorcerer names the destination she intends to sail to. If she has even approximate knowledge of its location, the Flory Ferry will sail itself as close as possible to that destination, using the sorcerer’s ([[Essence]] + [[Occult]]) for sailing rolls. However, it lacks the sapience to engage in pursuit or naval combat. Other characters can attempt to sail it, although the Speed bonus from its magically impelled travel becomes a −1 penalty if they attempt to travel anywhere but the named destination. Once it’s reached its destination and its crew has disembarked, the ferry shrinks back into the foliage from which it was summoned. Sorcerers with an [[Essence]] pool may use the following powers while this spell is active: 
# Barque of Durant Heartwood
(10m, 1wp; Simple; One day): 
The ship’s hull hardens to thick bark, gaining (Essence/2, rounded up) −0 [[Hull]] levels. Once they fade away, damage marked in them rolls over into regular [[Hull]] levels. 
# Hay-Fever Seabloom
(5m; Supplemental; Instant; Pilot): 
Thick, sticky pollen trails in the Floral Ferry’s wake. Success on an interval of a naval pursuit while fleeing a ship imposes a penalty of (sorcerer’s [[Intelligence]]) on the pursuing captains’ next interval. 
# Whirling Maple-Seed Swiftness
(10m, 1wp; Simple; One day; Pilot): 
As long as the sorcerer helms the [[Floral Ferry]], its total Speed is doubled. A sorcerer with this as her control spell may awaken [[Evocations]] from the [[Floral Ferry]]. 
# [[Countermagic#Distortion|Distortion]] 
(Goal Number: 5)
Distorting the [[Floral Ferry]] allows the opposing sorcerer to name a new destination that it will sail itself towards.
