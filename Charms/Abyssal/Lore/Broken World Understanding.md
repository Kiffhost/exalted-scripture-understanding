*The Abyssal’s piercing intellect gleans secrets buried beneath the world’s skin.*
The Abyssal keen rolls ([Intelligence or Perception] + [[Lore]]) to examine a mundane object or structure, artifact, hearthstone, manse, or undead construct.. The difficulty is 3 by default. For hearthstones and manses, it’s the target’s Merit rating if it’s higher, or 10 for N/A [[Merits]]. Success lets her player ask the [[Storyteller]] one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes.
 - Who created it?  - Why was it created?  - What does it do?  - How can I destroy or diminish it? If the [[Storyteller]] doesn’t have an answer in mind, the Abyssal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
