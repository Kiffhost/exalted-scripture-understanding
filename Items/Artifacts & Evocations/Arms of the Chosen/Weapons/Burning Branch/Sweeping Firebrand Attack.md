*Channeling her anima banner through [[Burning Branch]], its wielder unleashes a deadly firestorm to engulf enemy armies.*
To use this Evocation, the longfang’s head must be ignited. The wielder makes a decisive attack against a battle group whose [[Size]] is (wielder’s Essence/2, round up) or lower. As long as the attack deals any damage, the enemy combatants catch fire, a recurring environmental hazard with difficulty 5, damage 4L/round. As long as it continues to burn, the battle group treats its [[Drill]] as one step lower (Exalted, pp. 206-207). Battle groups with poor [[Drill]] must instead roll against rout at the end of each round. Enemy commanders can make a special rally roll to direct a battle group to extinguish the flames without breaking ranks, lowering the hazard’s damage by one in addition to rallying’s normal benefits. Once the damage is lowered to zero, the fire is extinguished. Magic can also extinguish the flame. Otherwise, it continues to burn until the scene ends or the battle group dissolves. 

## Resonant

The wielder may use this Evocation against battle groups whose [[Size]] exceeds her (Essence/2), but must deal enough damage to reduce the group’s [[Size]] to set them ablaze.
