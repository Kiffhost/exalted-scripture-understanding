*The Solar draws the [[Essence]] of the world through her reins, drawing herself toward her destination with incredible speed.*
This Charm lasts one hour, but the motes are not committed. If the prerequisite is active, it costs only two motes, one [[Willpower]] to activate, otherwise the mote cost is four. It adds ([[Essence]] or three, whichever is greater) successes to any [[Ride]]-based commands, and to each interval of a race (see p. 197). Also, when she succeeds at a mounted rush (see p. 197), she gains two point of [[Initiative]]. If her mount is rolled into combat, it gains two points of [[Initiative]] as well. Outside of combat, the Solar can travel at dramatic speeds. In narrative time, a distance that would take her mount an hour to cover can be cleared in ten minutes. What would take her a day can be covered in a handful of hours, and what would take a week can be covered in a single day. At the end of the hour, if the Solar chooses to renew [[Wind-Racing [[Essence]] Infusion]], ignore the [[Willpower]] cost.
