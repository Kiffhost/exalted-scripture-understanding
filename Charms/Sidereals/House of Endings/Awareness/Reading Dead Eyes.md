The Sidereal picks at the frayed strands of fate that twine about a corpse to find its final moments, seeing through the eyes of one about to die. Touching a corpse or the grave dirt over a newly buried corpse, the Sidereal rolls (Perception + Awareness) at a difficulty of the deceasedâ€™s Guile, potentially suffering penalties if a great deal of time has passed since the corpse died. If successful, she witnesses the scene in which he died. She views it from his perspective but may make Perception-based rolls to notice details he may have overlooked. She also learns if the deceased still lingers as a ghost and if his lower soul has become a hungry ghost.
