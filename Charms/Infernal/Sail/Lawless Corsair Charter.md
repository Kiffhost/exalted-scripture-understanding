*The Infernal’s crew obeys only the law of the lawless, keeping honour among thieves and corsairs.*

The Infernal’s authority empowers those who join her crew and sign their name to her ship’s articles of agreement or a similar code of law, or take an equivalent act that leaves a physical record. They gain the following benefits:
- They count as having a Minor Principle that opposes recognizing or obeying any other official authority or legal system.
- They add one die on Sail rolls.
- They add one die on Larceny rolls while on ships or in other nautical contexts (e.g., stealing documents from a harbourmaster’s dockyard office).
- They add one die in rolls with any Ability to conceal or avoid the exposure of crimes they committed before joining the Infernal’s crew.

First Circle demons and Demon-Blooded can benefit from this Charm, but other supernatural beings can’t.

A character loses these benefits if he leaves the Infernal’s crew or if his name is stricken from the charter. If a character spends an entire story off the Infernal’s ship, the benefits lapse until the next time he boards it.
