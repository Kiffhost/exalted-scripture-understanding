The Lunar need not speak to be obeyed; she beckons adoring masses to tend to her every need with naught but her animal charms.
When the Lunar uses Glance-Oration Technique, she ignores multiple target penalties. Targets with a positive Tie toward her or her current form or whose Resolve is lower than her Appearance suffer −1 Resolve (which may increase the dice added by the Lunar’s Appearance). If it’s a Tie of loyalty or affection, bonus dice from Appearance are converted to automatic successes.
