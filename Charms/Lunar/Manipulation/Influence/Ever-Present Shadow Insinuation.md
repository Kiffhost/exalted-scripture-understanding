Suffusing her mien with notoriety, the Lunar subtly implicates herself in others’ minds. This Charm functions like its prerequisite, but inverts its effect, leaving targets certain that the unknown individual they’re thinking of is the Lunar, or her current shape. If the Lunar uses this Charm and its prerequisite simultaneously, the cognitive dissonance of being certain that the Lunar was and was not the unknown individual overwhelms targets, imposing a −1 penalty on social and mental rolls until they resist one or both [[Charms]]. Each contradictory certainty can be leveraged as a separate [[Intimacy]]. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as an [[Appearance]] Charm.
