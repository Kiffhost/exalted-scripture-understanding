The Lunar hangs her misdeeds around the throats of rivals and enemies, letting them bear the blame. She can use Night Sky Burial to leave false evidence implicating another character as the culprit of the concealed action. She can choose to combine this with another one of the options offered by Night Sky Burial: e.g., if she chooses Escaped Tiger Tragedy she might make it seem her victim freed a caged beast that caused the ultimate act.
