Measure the Wind enables a spirit to measure someone’s “nature.” This reveals, broadly, what the individual is—a mortal, a demon, another god, a denizen of the Wyld, and so forth. If an Exalt is scrutinized, Measure the Wind provides a strong “feeling” of their patron, allowing the Charm to tell a Solar from a Dragon-Blooded (and, incidentally, to tell what Elemental Dragon or Maiden a Terrestrial or Sidereal derives from, although the Castes and Aspects of other Exalts remain indistinguishable to the Charm). Measure the Wind can pierce mundane disguises, but not any deception created or reinforced by Essence, such as Solar Larceny Charms or Lunar shapeshifting.
Most Spirits are able to take the measure of any character within a specific condition related to their essence.
