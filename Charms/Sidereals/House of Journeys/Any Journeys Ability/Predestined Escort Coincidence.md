Glimpsing the direction of someone’s fate, the Sidereal subtly tugs his strand into place. The Sidereal makes a special (Perception + Journeys Ability) read intentions roll to discern where someone most wants to travel to. If her target already has some business that requires travel or plans for travel, the Sidereal learns both the destination and what he intends to do here. If not, this reveals a destination related to one of his Major or Defining Intimacies that he yearns to visit, as well as that Intimacy — a farmer with a Defining Principle of belief in the Immaculate Philosophy might long to make the pilgrimage to Juche. If the Sidereal succeeds, she can then wordlessly make an influence roll a persuade roll to convince her target to let her provide transportation, serve as a guide, or otherwise help him in making that journey. If successful, her target realizes the Sidereal can provide such aid and seeks it from her. She’s never perceived as this influence’s source. Successfully leading him to his destination counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX).
