Rousing Hidden Power Feeding on the [[Essence]] of her foe’s defeat, the Lunar makes his power a part of her own.
Upon defeating or taking the shape of an enemy powerful enough to pose formidable opposition, the Lunar can crystallize his defeat into a hearthstone within herself, paying one mote for a lesser stone or three motes for a greater one. Defeat need not be in combat; public debate, business competition, or a race to retrieve a First Age relic all qualify.
The chosen hearthstone should reflect the enemy’s nature, his relationship with the Lunar, the nature of his defeat, or some combination of these. It may have [[Evocations]] that reflect or emulate his distinctive powers or replicate [[Eclipse]] [[Charms]] he knew. The Lunar’s player doesn’t need to decide on a stone immediately, especially for custom designs.
The stone gains the Steady keyword and loses Dependent. It manifests within the Lunar per [[Desert Basilisc Diadem]], but doesn’t count against that Charm’s limit. It can’t be removed from her body.
The Lunar can incur [[Experience Debt]] to make a hearthstone permanent: six experience for a lesser stone or twelve experience for a greater stone. The first time she does so, she waives the cost for a lesser stone or reduces a greater stone’s cost to four experience.
This Charm can be stacked to manifest up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) multiple hearthstones. Stones made permanent with experience don’t count against this limit.
