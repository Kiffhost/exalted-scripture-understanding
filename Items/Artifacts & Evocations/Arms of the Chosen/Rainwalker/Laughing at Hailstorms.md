Rainwalker expands its aegis of protection to all in its wielder’s charge, holding back storms and tempests. Opening the parasol, the wielder unleashes a ripple of Essence that disperses non-magical weather conditions out to long range. Within that area, rain stops, strong winds are slowed, lightning doesn’t strike, and so on, for this Evocation’s duration. The wielder and all allies within range gain +1 Defense and add (Essence) bonus successes on rolls against environmental hazards. Laughing at Hailstorms can only be used once per day. 

## Resonant

An Essence 4 repurchase lets the wielder use this Evocation once per story to strike away storms or hold back tempests. She disperses weather out to (Essence) miles away, and can even negate magical weather such as Rain of Doom (Exalted, p. 483). This once-per-story effect cannot be reset by the Dawn Caste anima power.
