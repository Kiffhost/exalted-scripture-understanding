The Dragon-Blood’s wrath leaves her foes pinned to the earth. An enemy damaged by her decisive attack loses his movement action on his next turn, and is impaled by her weapon, requiring him or an ally to succeed on a Strength 3 feat of strength at difficulty (higher of the Dragon-Blood’s Essence or Strength) before he can take any movement actions.
