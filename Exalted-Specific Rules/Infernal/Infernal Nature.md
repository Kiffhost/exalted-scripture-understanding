# [[CREATURES OF DARKNESS|Creatures of Darkness]]
As the Chosen of the Yozis, the Infernals are marked as creatures of darkness by their very nature. They’re vulnerable to certain magic — especially that of the Solar Exalted.

An Infernal who proves herself an ally of Creation might eventually cease to be a creature of darkness. This is a narrative milestone rather than a mechanical one, something that should come at the resolution of a narrative arc or at an especially dramatic moment.
# [[Enemies of Fate]]
The Infernals transcend Creation’s web of fate, obscuring them from some divinations, but also leaving them vulnerable to certain Sidereal Charms.
# [[The Solar Bond|The Lunar Bond]]
The Lunar Bond endures in the Green Sun Princes, untouched by the Yozis’ power. When an Infernal first encounters her Lunar mate, she usually experiences a flash of recognition, forming a Minor Tie to him — often a negative one.

A Lunar mate is a five-dot [[Allies|Ally]]. Otherwise, the mate’s role in the story is up to the Storyteller. Not all Infernals have Lunar mates.
# Martial Arts
Infernals have [[Charm Keywords#Mastery|Mastery]] with [[Martial Arts]]. They can learn Sidereal Martial Arts from a Sidereal mentor.
# Sorcery
Infernals can initiate into Solar Circle sorcery and Shadow Circle necromancy.
# Evocations
Infernals are [[Evocations#Resonant|resonant]] with [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] and exotic substances of Hell (Arms of the Chosen, p. 16). They’re neutral with other materials.
