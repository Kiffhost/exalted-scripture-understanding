*The world sees the Sidereal as nothing more than an extension of her obligations, a mysterious figure bound by a pact signed in blood.*
When the Sidereal uses Messenger’s Oath, she may pay a surcharge of one aggravated health level to gain the following benefits
- Her appearance is obscured. Others perceive her only as a rider suitable for what they understand her obligation to be, not noticing any details that are inconsistent or unrelated to her role. This renders her immune to arcane fate but suppresses any resplendent destiny she wears.
- Rolls against her to discover information unrelated to the obligation suffer +1 target number.
She can oppose scrying, Divination Charms, and similar magic that’s normally unrolled, rolling (Manipulation + Ride) against an appropriate (Attribute + Ability).
- If a character fails a roll to scry on her, the Sidereal may pay one Willpower to make him believe he succeeded, providing false information based on what the person who issued the task to the Sidereal might have done in her place.
- Her Auspicious Prospects for (Caste) reveal whether something will benefit or hinder her task, rather than whether they align with destiny.
Any mount ridden by the Sidereal also gains these benefits.
