Attaining the apex of sensory perfection, the Lunar embodies the Essence of ultimate clarity. She may extend the duration of Sense-Sharpening Change to Indefinite for a one-Willpower surcharge. If she activates it multiple times in an instant to enhance multiple senses, she need only pay this surcharge once for all of them. While the Lunar has Sense-Sharpening Change active enhancing all five senses, the costs of her Perception Charms are discounted by two motes, and Argent Goddess Eye awards two motes for 10s instead of one.
