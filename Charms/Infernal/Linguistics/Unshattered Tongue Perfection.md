*Before the babbling, broken dialects of gods and man, all existence spoke as one. The Infernal restores that linguistic order.*

The Infernal imparts temporary fluency in the Malfean dialect of Old Realm to a touched character, while suppressing his ability to understand all other languages. That character can incur experience debt to learn Old Realm permanently after this Charm ends. If a target is unwilling, the Infernal must make a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Linguistics) instil roll against him. Characters who already knew Old Realm are unaffected.

The imparted language alters the minds of those who think in it. Affected characters suffer −1 Resolve against influence used by characters with higher Essence or characters who are their hierarchical superior within an organization.

A character can spend (Infernal’s Essence) Willpower to resist this influence. Mortals and trivial characters can’t resist with Willpower.
## [[Keys]]
#### Ecstatic Glossolalia Bestowal (Linguistics 5, Essence 2) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to affect any number of characters within medium range, without needing to touch them.
#### Orthodox Mind Vocabulary (Linguistics 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal doubles 9s on this Charm’s influence roll. Affected characters can’t spend Willpower to resist it until they’ve gone a full day without speaking or writing in Old Realm, or a full hour without hearing or reading it.
#### Hierarchic Logos Syntax ([[#Ecstatic Glossolalia Bestowal (Linguistics 5, Essence 2) (+1wp)|Ecstatic Glossolalia Bestowal]], [[#Orthodox Mind Vocabulary (Linguistics 5, Essence 2)|Orthodox Mind Vocabulary]]) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm an organization that she leads, requiring her to first spend at least an hour interacting with its headquarters, members, or business. This Charm’s influence spreads throughout the organization’s hierarchy, affecting a number of group members equivalent to a Size (Intelligence) battle group (Exalted, p. 206). This begins with the characters nearest to where the Infernal uses this key and spreads outward. Its duration becomes indefinite. However, affected group members only need to pay one Willpower to exist, and can do so even if they’re mortal.
