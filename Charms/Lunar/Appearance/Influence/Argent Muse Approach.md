Even as gods and princes speak, all eyes are on the Lunar. When another character makes an influence roll against targets that can see the Lunar, she uses her striking looks to assist him, beguiling them with alluring beauty or intimidating them into agreement. The roll gains (Lunarâ€™s [[Essence]]) non-Charm dice and rerolls 1s until they cease to appear. A successful roll also instills a Minor Tie of desire or fear, as appropriate, toward the Lunar (or her current shape).
