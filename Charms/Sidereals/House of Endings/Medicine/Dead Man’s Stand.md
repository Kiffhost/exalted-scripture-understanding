The Sidereal proclaims her acceptance of her own mortality with the Greater Sign of the Corpse; if she is to die, she will meet her end nobly. Any non-aggravated decisive damage the Sidereal suffers is held in abeyance rather than being applied to her health track. Likewise, any crippling effects used against her after this Charm is activated are suspended for this Charm’s duration. She still suffers physical injury but doesn’t face any consequences from them while this Charm lasts. This Charm ends if she’s crashed. Once this Charm ends, the Sidereal suffers all suspended damage and crippling effects. If this kills her, her corpse remains sufficiently intact for an open-casket funeral, no matter how grievous her injuries.
