*Thrilling in bloodshed, the deathknight is inspired with strategies for further slaughter.*
The Abyssal can pay a one-mote surcharge when she uses [[Blood-Soaked Battlefield Hunger]] to reflexively enact a stratagem with a threshold of up to half her successes on the [[Join Battle]] roll, rounded up. The stratagem must be contextually appropriate, potentially requiring a stunt to explain how she achieves it.
