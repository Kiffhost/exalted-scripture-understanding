*Stoking an ally’s [[Essence]] with herbal smoke, chanted prayers, acupuncture, psychedelics, or similar treatments, the Lunar unbinds all restraints on his might.*
After an hour, she rolls ([[Intelligence]] + {Medicine or Occult}) at difficulty (target’s [[Essence]], maximum 5). Success excites his [[Essence]] to feverish intensity. He reduces wound penalties by two and ignores fatigue penalties. He adds a success on ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) rolls and doubles [[Stamina]] to determine how long he can function without food, water, or air (Exalted, 232). However, he can’t sleep unless it’s magically forced on him. Even then, he doesn’t regain [[Willpower]] from sleep. Once this Charm ends, the character is exhausted, suffering a −5 fatigue penalty on all rolls. This penalty falls by one every (6 − his [[Stamina]], minimum 1) days of rest; he can’t benefit from this Charm again until it falls to zero.
