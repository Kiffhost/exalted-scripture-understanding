The Sidereal takes steps to avoid a future where her enemy’s quiver has anything left. The Sidereal rolls a special (Wits + Dodge) disarm gambit against an enemy wielding a ranged weapon within medium range. Instead of using his Defense, the target opposes the attack roll with a (Wits + combat Ability) ammunition check (Exalted, p. 202). If successful, he’s revealed to have unexpectedly run out of ammunition and suffers withering damage equal to the Initiative roll’s extra successes, awarding Initiative to the Sidereal as usual. If he’s previously cached any ammunition nearby, it also turns out to have somehow disappeared or become unusable. He suffers +1 target number on rolls to scavenge for more ammunition. Characters with Charms like Phantom Arrow Technique are immune to this gambit.
