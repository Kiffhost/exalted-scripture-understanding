Tulat urges his wearer to rethink a move he considers a mistake. The wearer can use this Evocation after moving — voluntarily or not — to return to her previous location without crossing the space between. Any damage or other harm she’d take as a result of moving is negated: falling, environmental hazards, damage from Heaven Thunder Hammer, etc. Alternatively, the wearer can use this Evocation at the end of any tick on which she moves, letting her act before she returns to where she was at the start of the tick. Doing so offers no protection against harm from her movement and doesn’t refund Initiative for disengaging. Any Initiative lost from disengaging is refunded if the wearer uses this Evocation to undo that movement.
