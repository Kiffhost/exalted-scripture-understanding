The Dragon-Blood can feel the lingering traces of supernatural power left by the might of gods and Exalted. When she comes within close range of a location where an Exalt’s anima has reached the bonfire level or where a spirit has used one of its greater miracles (Exalted, p. 311) during the current story, she may use this Charm to roll (Perception + Awareness), gaining information based on the number of successes. 1-2 successes: The Dragon-Blood gains a general sense of how long ago the trace was left — minutes, hours, days, months, or longer. 3-4 successes: The Dragon-Blood can determine precisely how long ago the trace was left. 5+ successes: As above, and the Dragon-Blood can determine whether the trace was left by a spirit or by an Exalt, as well as whether its Essence rating is greater or lower than her own. If she’s personally witnessed an Exalt or spirit of the type that left the trace using its overt supernatural power, she recognizes its nature, able to identify the anima of a Solar Anathema or to tell the greater miracles of a god from those of a demon.
