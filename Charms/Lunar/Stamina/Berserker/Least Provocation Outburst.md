The Lunar’s rage rises to meet her foes’ hostility.
[[Relentless Lunar Fury]] can be used upon taking withering damage. If the Lunar knows [[Mother Grizzly Attitude]] or similar [[Charms]], their conditions can also be met by withering damage.
Using [[Relentless Lunar Fury]] grants the Lunar [[Initiative]] equal to her wound penalty. If her wound penalty increases while using it, she gains [[Initiative]] for each point of increase.
