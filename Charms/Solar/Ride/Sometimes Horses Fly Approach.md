The Solar touches her mount with a mote of purefic power, opening its mind and teaching it the trick of running on air. The horse can gallop on water, clouds, and even an open gap across a chasm, allowing the Solar to take mounted movement actions across gulfs that would otherwise be impossible to cross.
