If the Lawgiver slays even one foe with Heaven Sword Flash, she may instantly unleash Circle of Bright Reaving, striking opponents on all sides within close range with a single withering attack. The Solar gains full Initiative reward from only the most damaging dice roll, and no more than three Initiative for each additional roll that does successful damage. If she manages to crash even a single opponent with this Charm, she has the option to unleash Heaven Sword Flash reflexively.
