*Emulating the Air Dragon, the armor unfolds a pair of blue jade wings.*
As long as the wearer has sufficient clearance for her 20-foot wingspan, she can fly as swiftly as a horse gallops. This functions as the five-dot version of the [[Wings]] Merit (Exalted, p. 167), including the penalty on actions taken in the air. While flying, she adds two bonus dice to all movement rolls. This Evocation ends if the wearer is crashed. If she is in the air, she plummets to the ground, although the armor cushions her from suffering any falling damage. 

## Special activation rules

If the wielder knows EagleWing Style (Exalted, p. 265) this Evocation awakens at no cost. 

## Dissonant

The precision and maneuverability of the armor’s wings is equivalent to that of the Merit’s threedot version. 

## Resonant

The wearer ignores the [[Wings]] Merit’s penalty on aerial actions.
