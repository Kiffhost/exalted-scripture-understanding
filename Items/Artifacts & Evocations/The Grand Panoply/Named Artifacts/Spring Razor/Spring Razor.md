Long ago, in the remote jungles of the Silent Crescent, there once dwelt a hateful dragon named Vasshir. Its claws were cracking oak, its eyes two glittering emeralds, and its mane was a fragrant and beautiful wash of drifting petals. Its breath was sweet and heavy with poison, and in its wake it left towns filled with peacefully smiling corpses. A sworn brotherhood of Dragon-Blooded heroes slew Vasshir, and one of their number, Cynis Katen, carved out its most fragrant and poisonous fang and carried it home. Carefully calibrating the flames of her forge, she smelted down a fortune in green jade and the finest steel of the Blessed Isle, and set to make a weapon worthy of commemorating her brothers’ triumph. Month by month she labored, coaxing together wood and Essence and molten jade, for it was her intent to never once scorch or scar the wood dragon’s tooth as she made it the core of Spring Razor. Year by year she heated and cooled the steel and jade and chanted efficacious chants to safeguard the wood. Decade by decade she sought out or imported deadly saps and oils and worked these into the daiklave’s blade. At last, in Realm Year 632, the year Katen noticed the first grey streaks in her hair, Spring Razor was quenched in the sap of a tree planted on the same day its forging began, and deemed ready for battle. Spring Razor is a double-edged daiklave with a slight curve to its blade, and is a deep and shining green from tip to hilt. Its guard is fashioned as a tangle of flowering brambles. The blade itself cherishes only elegance, beauty, and death, and unfolds its Essence to those who best embody those things. Cynis Katen insisted that Spring Razor is the most pure expression of a venomous artifact to have emerged from a forge during the reign of the Scarlet Empress, though the wielders of other weapons such as the longfang Helltooth and the powerbow Green Death beg to differ. Spring Razor boasts two hearthstone sockets hidden within the brambles of its guard.
