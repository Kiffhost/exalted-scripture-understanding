Adapting a fluid battle stance, the Lunar moves in perfect synchrony with her enemy’s blows. She gains +1 [[Defense]], and doesn’t incur onslaught penalties from attacks that miss her. Whenever she uses [[Bending Before the Storm]] to successfully defend against an attack, her attacker loses one [[Initiative]] (which she doesn’t gain).
