One thousand elite guards keep the peace in the Palace of the Deliberative. Ostensibly on hand to defend against assassins and insurrectionists, their primary function is to protect rowdy Deliberative members from one another and enforce decrees of the Greater Chamber’s Guardian of Enlightened Discourse and the Lesser Chamber’s Protector of the Debate. Outfitted in brass-chased lamellar and purple half-capes, they bear ceremonial naginatas and more practical short swords. Their insignia is a dragon with a scroll clutched in its jaws.
