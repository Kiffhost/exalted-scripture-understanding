*Centering herself for a moment to perceive every possible angle of attack, the stylist unleashes countless strikes, her anima banner taking the form of many arms and legs to express the fullness of her prowess.* 
When she uses [[Motion of Myriad Legs]], she may pay a seven-mote, three-anima surcharge to add one to the maximum number of attacks she can make and add (Essence/2, rounded up) dice of damage to each attack. 
If she deals damage with at least two attacks before making the final attack, it’s unblockable. With three damaging attacks, the final attack becomes unblockable and undodgeable. 
With four damaging attacks, the final attack becomes an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). If the stylist savages a grappled enemy, she may expend up to ([[Strength]]) rounds of control, adding that many dice to the damage of each attack. 
## Mastery
Non-Excellency [[Charms]] need only have their cost paid once to apply to all attacks the stylist makes. 
## Terrestrial
This Charm can only be used against crashed enemies and can’t inflict ambushes.
