*The Dragon-Blood’s violent prowess is fluid and formless, matched only by that of her weapon — the water itself.*
As long as she’s within short range of a large source of water such as a river or a cistern, she may draw it to herself, engulfing her body in a fluid mantle. If no source of water is available, she may expend a level of anima instead. With a thought, countless lashing tendrils of water extend to strike, allowing her to make unarmed attacks out to short range, adding a non-Charm success on both attack and damage rolls, and adding ([[Strength]]) Overwhelming. The water tendrils also grant her natural attacks the Disarming and Flexible tags (Exalted, p. 586). The Dragon-Blood takes no penalties for flurrying unarmed attacks with other physical actions using the tendrils, such as scaling a palace’s walls or using a feat of strength to lift a portcullis. This Charm is compatible with [[Martial Arts]] styles that use unarmed attacks.
