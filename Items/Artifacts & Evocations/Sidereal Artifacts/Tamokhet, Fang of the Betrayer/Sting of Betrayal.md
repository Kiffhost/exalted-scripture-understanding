*The plague sealed within Tamokhet afflicts not its victim’s flesh, but his relationships.*
When Tamokhet’s wielder makes a decisive attack, if she knows one of her target’s positive Ties to an individual, she adds ([[Intimacy]]) dice of damage. If she deals any damage, her victim is exposed to the [[Doom of Tamokhet]], a supernatural disease that infects that [[Intimacy|Tie]]. Repeat exposures to the Doom can infect multiple Ties, but this is still treated as a single disease, using the same intensity for all infected [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. 
## Dissonant
[[Sting of Betrayal]] can only enhance unexpected attacks and attacks in the first round of combat against enemies who’ve failed rolls to notice Tamokhet while it’s concealed (Exalted, p. 588). 
## Resonant
An [[Essence]] 2 repurchase adds +2 to the Doom’s virulence and morbidity and lowers its interval to one day.
