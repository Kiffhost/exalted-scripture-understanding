In mortal hands, a daiklave is an unwieldy, oversized sword which weighs far too much to wield with any sort of ease or finesse, while artifact armor is nigh-impossible to move in. The secret of such items is in their attunementâ€” a few motes fed into the artifact establish a spiritual link between weapon or armor and Exalted user, making 40 pounds of golden sword feel light as a dagger and swift as a breeze. Attunement can be established in a matter of a few heartbeats, and persists until the Exalt drop her commitment or is separated from the artifact for a full day.
