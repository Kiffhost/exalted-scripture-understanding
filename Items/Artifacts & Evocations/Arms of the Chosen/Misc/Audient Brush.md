These ink brushes were employed by Old Realm calligraphers, and many remain in use by Dynastic bureaucrats, poets, and scholars. The brush’s hairs are of shining silver; the shaft — wood, ivory, metal, or even jade — wraps around an orichalcum core. Attuned for one mote, the brush’s silver hairs become soft as rabbit’s fur while remaining tough as metal. An attuned brush produces ink as desired; this is of finest quality, and changes color between brushstrokes at the owner’s whim. It counts as exceptional equipment for Craft and Linguistics (Exalted, p. 580).

For three motes, an audient brush comes alive, functioning as a scribe for one scene. Hovering above the page, it transcribes all speech within the immediate area. The brush uses different handwriting and colors to distinguish each speaker, and can pull fresh sheets from a ream or open a book to blank pages. Its owner can instruct it to ignore certain speakers or strike statements from the record.
