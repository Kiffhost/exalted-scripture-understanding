No matter how mighty the force directed against her, the Lunar refuses to yield. This Charm may be used after being hit by a decisive attack or failing to resist a trap or environmental hazard, before damage is rolled. If the damage roll fills all the Lunar’s health levels of one type, any further damage is negated; e.g., if an attack filled all of a Lunar’s −1 levels, it couldn’t inflict further damage to her −2 or greater levels. This Charm can only be used once per day. It doesn’t need to be reset if it fails to prevent damage.
