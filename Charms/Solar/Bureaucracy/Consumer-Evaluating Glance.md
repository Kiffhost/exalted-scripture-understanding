The Lawgiver can evaluate a buyer’s intention and budget with a glance. This enacts a ([Perception or Wits] + Bureaucracy) read intentions action against the target’s Guile. If successful, the Exalt can tell if the target plans to betray or cheat her. If he does, the Solar’s Resolve is raised by her Essence against all bargain action attempts by that character. She may also use this Charm to determine a character’s Resources rating and whether he intend to buy or whether he needs to be swayed into attempting a bargain action.
