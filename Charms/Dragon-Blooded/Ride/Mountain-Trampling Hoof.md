*The Dragon-Blood endows her mount with the endurance of the mountains and the strength of a falling avalanche as it charges forward like a battering ram to smash down gates and fortifications.*
The Exalt’s mount makes a feat of demolition to destroy or topple an object at least human-sized, adding (Essence/2, rounded up) non-Charm bonus successes. If she uses this Charm after spending multiple consecutive turns moving towards the object, each range band of movement lowers the [[Strength]] total required to attempt the feat by one, to a maximum of ([[Essence]]). The mount is able to complete the feat in instants, even if it would normally take longer. The immense force unleashed by the mount’s battering charge isn’t without risk. For every 1 on its feat of strength roll, roll a single die of bashing damage against it, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This Charm cannot be used if the Dragon-Blood’s mount has no undamaged health levels above Incapacitated.
