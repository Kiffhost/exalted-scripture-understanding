Waiting for her foe to make the first move, the Sidereal tests his offense and demonstrates its vulnerabilities to him. The Sidereal makes a decisive counterattack in response to any attack, even if it isn’t against her. She can’t use this Charm if the attack’s target uses a [[Clash]] or Counterattack Charm of his own. With a [[Melee]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use this Charm even if the attack’s target clashes or counterattacks.
