The blood of the dragons confers incredible resilience. Each purchase of this Charm grants extra health levels based on the character’s Stamina rating. 

At Stamina 1 and 2: Two −2 health levels. 
3 and 4: One −1 and one −2 level. 
5: One −1 and two −2 levels. 

This Charm may be purchased (Resistance) times. If the Dragon-Blood’s Stamina increases, her health levels change to reflect her new rating.
