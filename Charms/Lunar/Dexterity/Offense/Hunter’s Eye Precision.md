Driven by pure will, the Lunar takes aim and fires in the instant that she spots her foe. She reflexively aims; this counts as a turn spent aiming for all purposes, like attacking from extreme range. A Dexterity 5, Essence 3 repurchase waives this Charmâ€™s Willpower cost when the Lunar uses it to aim at a crashed enemy at medium range or further. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has a vision-enhancing Merit may learn this as a Perception Charm, with Wolf-Eye Advantage (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
