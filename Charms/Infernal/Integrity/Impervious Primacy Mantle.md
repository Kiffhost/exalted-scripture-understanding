*It is inconceivable that another could hold authority over the Green Sun Prince. She has no masters, not even the Yozis who made her.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after her Resolve is beaten by a persuade or threaten roll that’s framed as a demand, order, or expression of authority. She perfectly defends against that influence. She can likewise defend against Psyche effects that control her or compel her to act.
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset by upholding a Defining Intimacy by defeating or punishing a narratively significant enemy who’s tried to command or control the Infernal this story.
