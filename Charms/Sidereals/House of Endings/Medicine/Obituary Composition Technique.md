Having accepted death’s inevitably, the Sidereal attains clarity and insight into it. Examining a corpse, the Sidereal rolls ([Intelligence or Perception] + Medicine) at difficulty 1-5, based on its age and any decomposition or mutilation it’s suffered. If a character has made a conceal evidence roll to tamper with the corpse or a similar roll, the Sidereal must beat that roll as well. Alternatively, she can use this Charm when interacting with an undead character, rolling against his Guile. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
-  What was the cause of death? 
-  How long has it been since he died? 
-  What unfinished business did he have? 
-  Was his death in accordance with destiny? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
