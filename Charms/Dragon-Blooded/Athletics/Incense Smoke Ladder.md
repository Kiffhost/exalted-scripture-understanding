*Soaring Leap Technique Like a burning ember, the Dragon-Blood drifts upwards through the air.*
She can run up walls and other vertical surfaces, even upside-down along a ceiling, as long as she maintains constant movement. However, she cannot disengage or withdraw up walls. If she ends her movement somewhere she couldnâ€™t normally stand and then fails to renew this Charm on her next turn, she falls and suffers damage normally.
