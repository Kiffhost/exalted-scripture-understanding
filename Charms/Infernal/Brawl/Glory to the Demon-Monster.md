*The terrified cries of children and the maimed are prayers to the Infernal, begging in vain for mercy.*

While using both [[Infernal Monster Awakened]] and [[Retribution Will Follow]], the Infernal reduces the cost of all Brawl Charms by one mote. Once per round, she can also reduce a Brawl Charm’s Willpower cost by one when she uses it on an attack.

This Charm ends if the Infernal is crashed or goes a round without attacking.
## Reset
Once per scene.
