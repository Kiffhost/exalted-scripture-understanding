The Sidereal’s forces fight with the assurance of those who know their victory has already been written into history, free of fear and hesitation. Allied battle groups gain −1 target number on rout checks; fear-based influence suffers +1 target number against them. They gain perfect morale against enemies of fate or in battles that align with one of the Sidereal’s Defining Principles.
