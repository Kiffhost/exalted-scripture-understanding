*No giant is beyond death.*
The Abyssal adds ([[Essence]]) automatic successes on a grapple attack roll, and her enemy’s 1s on the control roll subtract successes. For the duration of the grapple, she adds ([[Essence]]) dice of damage on savaging attacks. If she knows [[Blood-Drinking Palm]], its [[Initiative]] cost is reduced by one.
The Abyssal can use this Charm to grapple enemies with Legendary [[Size]], though she can’t drag, restrain, throw, or slam them without an appropriate stunt.
