The plague sealed within Tamokhet afflicts not its victim’s flesh, but his relationships. When Tamokhet’s wielder makes a decisive attack, if she knows one of her target’s positive Ties to an individual, she adds (Intimacy) dice of damage. If she deals any damage, her victim is exposed to the Doom of Tamokhet, a supernatural disease that infects that Tie. It has virulence and morbidity (6 − Intimacy) and an interval of one week. The Doom is a Psyche effect as well as a disease; rolls against it use (Wits + Integrity) instead of (Stamina + Resistance). Medical diagnosis and treatment are useless unless enhanced by magic. Minor: The victim’s relationship is infected with irrational mistrust. Voluntarily strengthening the Tie costs one Willpower. Major: The victim obsesses over the possibility of being betrayed by the Tie’s object. As above, and when he tries to use the infected Tie against social influence or for another purpose, the Storyteller can deny it unless he pays one Willpower to do so. Otherwise, he must use a different Intimacy. This counts as a botch inflicted by the disease (Exalted, p. 234). Defining: The victim is certain the Tie’s object plots his downfall. As above, but the Tie is suppressed completely. Instead of preventing the victim from using the Tie, the Storyteller can prevent him from taking any action that would align with the suppressed Tie. Doing so requires entering a Decision Point and citing a Defining Intimacy. Death: The Doom’s symptoms never result in death — at least, not directly. Repeat exposures to the Doom can infect multiple Ties, but this is still treated as a single disease, using the same intensity for all infected Intimacies. 

## Dissonant

Sting of Betrayal can only enhance unexpected attacks and attacks in the first round of combat against enemies who’ve failed rolls to notice Tamokhet while it’s concealed (Exalted, p. 588). 

## Resonant

An Essence 2 repurchase adds +2 to the Doom’s virulence and morbidity and lowers its interval to one day.
