The Sidereal sees no need to take the opinions, concerns, or advice of others into consideration, confident in her own wisdom. She makes decisions based solely on her own judgment and priorities; even if she’s given advice that seems obviously correct to her, she’s too proud to act on it. She likewise ignores any criticism of her choices or actions.
This ends if the Sidereal suffers a significant defeat or setback that could’ve been avoided if she’d heeded someone else’s guidance.
