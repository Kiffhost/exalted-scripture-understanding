*Heavenly Typhoon roars through the air like a tornado unleashed, splitting into a dozen spiraling afterimages that shower enemies with furious cutting [[Essence]].*
The wielder rolls a withering attack against a condemned target, and also applies her attack roll against every condemned enemy within short range of him. She only rolls damage against the original target; other foes struck lose [[Initiative]] equal to the 10s on the damage roll. The wielder cannot gain more than ([[Essence]]) total [[Initiative]] from the secondary targets. This Evocation may only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a nontrivial condemned enemy. 

## Dissonant

A character dissonant with jade cannot awaken this Evocation. 

## Resonant

A character resonant with jade gains one [[Willpower]] if this Evocation crashes at least one enemy.
