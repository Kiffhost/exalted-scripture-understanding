*The sorcerer steals a word from the lips of Jacint, whose voice creates the causeways of Hell; beneath her feet, a spike of black stone erupts and extends towards any point she can see.*

The sorcerer instantaneously creates a road that can stretch up to (Essence x 2) miles, shooting forward from her position. The chosen path must be perfectly straight, though it can be at any angle, even vertical, and must both begin and end at a building or on solid ground. It requires no other supports, allowing it to bridge canyons or pass over lakes. This road harmlessly shunts aside anything in its path that can be moved even slightly, but stops prematurely at any obstacle it cannot move.

The bridge is only wide enough for a single person to walk and thin enough to be grasped with a single hand. It is far stronger than it appears, able to bear any weight, and as difficult to destroy as foot-thick stone. Any damage or force that mars the road’s surface is naturally smoothed away over a few minutes, and it can’t be made slippery by water, ice, or the like.
# Control
When the sorcerer speaks with great conviction, a small patch of black stone forms at her feet, though it lacks the road’s supernatural properties. After creating a road, she can cast this spell a second time to expand it to the width of several people walking side-by-side.
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15)
The road’s surface is twisted into a helix for (distorting character’s Essence) range bands, becoming difficult terrain.
