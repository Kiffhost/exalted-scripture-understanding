*The Infernal’s mount snarls as its maw unhinges, splitting at the seams to bloom into a terrible, hungry flower.*

The Infernal’s mount gains the follow benefits from its monstrous transformation:
- It gains a bite attack, with a base attack pool of (Infernal’s Essence + 7) dice, Damage (Infernal’s Essence + 10)L, Overwhelming (Infernal’s Essence + 1), and the Grappling tag. If it already has a bite attack, it uses the best of both sets of weapon traits and gains an additional +1 Overwhelming.
- It can consume meat for sustenance, but not any other food.
- When it makes a withering attack against an enemy it’s capable of eating, it adds (Infernal’s Essence) raw damage. It adds (Infernal’s Essence) damage dice on decisive attacks against such prey, and adds that many dice on the Initiative and control rolls of grapple gambits against them.
- It adds two dice on tracking rolls to pursue quarry that it’s capable of eating and on smell- or taste-based Awareness rolls to detect them.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she uses [[Beast of Proud Bearing]].
