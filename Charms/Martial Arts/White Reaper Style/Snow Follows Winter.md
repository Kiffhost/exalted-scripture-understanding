A brilliant flare of scarlet suffuses the silver halos of the White Reaper’s corona, as if stained with the blood of countless enemies. Then, in an instant, it flickers out, vanishing into her wounds and sealing them with a hissing burst of steam. The martial artist must have White Reaper Form active and at least one damaged -2 health level to use Snow Follows Winter, paying a point of Willpower at the start of her turn to heal (current halos) levels of bashing and lethal damage. Doing so expends these halos at the end of her turn. This healing surge can only be used once per scene. Additionally, for the rest of the scene, the martial artist gains the following benefits while she is in White Reaper Form:

- The martial artist reduces any wound penalties she suffers by the number of halos she has. 
- Enemies who have witnessed the awful power of their seemingly invincible enemy lose their courage in battle. Any rout check provoked by the martial artist’s attacks are made at (1 + [halos/2, round up]) difficulty 
- Whenever she resets to base Initiative after making a decisive attack, she may add +1 to her base Initiative for each halo she has. Doing so expends all halos at the end of the turn. 

## Special activation rules

Snow Follows Winter can only be used once per fight. 

## Mastery

Using Snow Follows Winter for the first time in a fight gives the martial artist a surge of (Stamina x halos) motes, which must be spent that turn on White Reaper Charms or Excellencies. Additionally, the martial artist may reset the healing power of Snow Follows Winter if she makes an attack that would cause her to gain a halo while she already has the maximum of (Essence) halos, but only if she currently has a -4 health level filled with damage or is in Initiative Crash.
