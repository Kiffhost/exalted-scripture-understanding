*Beneath the Abyssal’s conscious mind dwells a watchful darkness, always seeking out traces of mystery.*
Whenever the Abyssal could gain relevant information from a [[Case Scene]] or [[Profile Character]] action, her intuition reveals this fact to her. The [[Storyteller]] should give her player a vague description of why it would be useful — for example, that there’s a hidden trap she could detect with a successful [[Case Scene]] roll, or that someone present in the scene is behaving suspiciously enough to warrant a [[Profile Character]] roll.
