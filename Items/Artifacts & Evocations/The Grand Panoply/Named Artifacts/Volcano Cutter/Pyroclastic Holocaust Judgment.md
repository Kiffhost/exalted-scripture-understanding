Summoning the total power of Volcano Cutter’s distant temple-manse, the impregnated [[Essence]] of the heaving battlefield, and her own fighting spirit into a single act of apocalypticdestruction,theSolarplungesherdaiklaveinto the earth. The ground shines for a moment beneath each eruption point on the battlefield, as though trying to birth a pantheon of new suns from Creation’s tortured depths, and then explodes into a cataclysm of unbound flames. Each affected eruption point explodes, hurling fire and molten stone four range bands into the sky. The explosion encompasses everything out to short range in every direction around each detonating eruption point, as well as all of the range bands between the affected eruption points. Trivial opponents and incidental scenery are obliterated by the explosion. Mighty foes such as gods, behemoths, un-Exalted heroes, and magical structures take 40 dice of lethal damage. Exalted caught in the blast take 25 dice of lethal damage. The sheer violent power drain of this pinnacle Evocation damages Volcano Cutter’s temple-manse, disabling further uses of [[Pyroclastic Holocaust Judgment]] until the manse is repaired. Left to work alone, Javarajati can complete these repairs in the span of one season, though if a geomantic architect helps repair the manse (see repair rules on p. 242) it could be restored significantly faster. 

## Special activation rules

In order to ignite this Evocation, there must be at least five eruption points at the battlefield with 25 [[Initiative]] stored in them, with no more than 2 range bands separating them (whether they’re arrayed in a line, a circle, or any other configuration is of no consequence), and the Solar must be within at least medium range of one of those eruption points. If more 25-[[Initiative]] eruption points exist within 2 range bands of the primary detonation chain, they too are set off by [[Pyroclastic Holocaust Judgment]].
