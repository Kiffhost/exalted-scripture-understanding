When the Lawgiver is cornered and fighting for her life, the burning power of her judgment becomes even more terrifying. Drawing the burning Essence of her life from her very wounds, she can unleash a powerful, Essence laden shot from her bow that can override other attacks and overwhelm her attackers. The Solar may use this Charm to clash attacks against her from short or close range, but only when she is in her -4 health levels. This clash gains (Essence) automatic successes, and the damage roll doubles 9s. However, Initiative damaged by this roll is not transferred to the Solar; it is instead rerolled as decisive damage against her target, ignoring hardness and doubling 10s. An Essence 5+ repurchase of this Charm removes the Perilous keyword, allowing the Solar to spend herself into lower negative Initiative numbers while crashed.
