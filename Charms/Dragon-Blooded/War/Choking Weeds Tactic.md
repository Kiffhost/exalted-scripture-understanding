The Dragon-Blood strangles an enemy army with guerrilla raids on supply lines and base camps, forcing them to fight on empty stomachs while her soldiers enjoy the windfall of stolen supplies. When she rolls a Strategic Maneuver, the threshold of the opposing general’s stratagem is increased by 1. If the Dragon-Blood successfully enacts her stratagem, enemy battle groups suffer a −3 penalty on their Join Battle rolls in the affected fight.
