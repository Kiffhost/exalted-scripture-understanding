The Sidereal entreats Saturn to stay her hand, postponing an ending whose time is not yet come. The Sidereal blesses another character, ensuring his end doesn’t come to soon. This costs one mote for mortals or three motes, one Willpower for others. The blessed character gains −1 target number on Awareness rolls to detect danger outside of combat and Resistance rolls. Once per scene, he may inflict +1 target number on a damage roll against him. Blessing a character requires a constellation-themed interaction with him. Upon taking this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses two of the below options. Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. Apprenticeship’s End Blessing (The Rising Smoke): The Sidereal’s target talks about how he’s changed and grown as a person. Best Medicine Approach (The Crow): The Sidereal’s target laughs with or at her. Chrysalis Cerement Rebirth (The Corpse): The Sidereal’s target heeds her advice about making a change in his life. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively. Death-of-Hope Acceptance (The Sword): The Sidereal’s target discusses his hopes or dreams for the future with her. Ruin Without Failure (The Haywain): The Sidereal’s target suffers a setback, loses money, or is betrayed. The Sidereal can bless multiple characters with this Charm.
