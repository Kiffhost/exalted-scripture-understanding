*With a wild swing, the Scar’s acid flies off as a wave of ruin.*

The wielder unleashes a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty (Essence + 1) and Damage 3L against all characters within close range. Non-Hideous characters suffer a penalty equal to their Appearance on the opposed roll, and battle groups suffer an additional −(Size) penalty.

Characters damaged by the hazard suffer Burn the Beauty’s crippling effect and the effect of either Melt the Blade or Pit the Armor. She can inflict both effects against enemies that take 2+ levels of damage. Damaged battle groups also reduce any bonuses they receive from Size by one for the rest of the scene for each level of damage.
### Dissonant
The wielder must deal 2+ damage to inflict Melt the Blade or Pit the Armor’s effects, and can’t inflict both.
### Resonant
The acid clings to damaged characters, exposing them to the hazard again at the start of each turn and potentially inflicting this Evocation’s debilitating effects anew. This lasts until they’ve taken (wielder’s Essence) turns or they take a miscellaneous action to wash away the acid.
