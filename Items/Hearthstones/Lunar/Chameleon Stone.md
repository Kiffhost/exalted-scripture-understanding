This triangular prism is colorless in itself, but takes on the colors of whatever surface it touches. When placed in an attuned hearthstone socket, the character may spend a point of Willpower to change his skin, hair, and eye colors to blend in with the natives of the area where he travels.
Facial structure may also very slightly change to facilitate this blending-in if necessary, producing epicanthic folds or the like. Removing the gem or spending another point of Willpower returns the character to their true appearance.
