*The Sidereal’s eyes take on a glassy sheen and her skin grows eerily cold to the touch; her every movement bespeaks a restraint, coordination, and focus beyond humanity’s limits.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
- When she makes an attack that benefits from aiming against an enemy at close range, she adds up to ([[Perception]]) attack roll extra successes as damage dice on a decisive attack or doubles that many extra successes on a withering attack. 
- On turns she aims, she can still use reflexive move actions to advance toward the enemy she aimed at. 
- She waives the [[Initiative]] cost of [[full defense]] actions. 
- [[Impeding the Flow]] negates all [[Defense|Parry]] penalties. If she benefits from a [[full defense]] or is protecting an ally with a defend other action, it adds +1 [[Defense|Parry]]. 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal can enter this Form reflexively when she aims against an enemy at close range or takes a [[full defense]] while within close range of at least one nontrivial enemy, applying its benefits to that action.
