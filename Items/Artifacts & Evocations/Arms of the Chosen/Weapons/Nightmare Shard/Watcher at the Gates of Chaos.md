Having peered into the nightmare-haunted depths of the silver blade’s Essence, the wielder is tempered against lesser horrors. She adds +2 Resolve against any fear-based social influence, and doubles 9s on Willpower rolls to resist Derangements. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience points. Instead, awakening it requires a wielder to willingly expose herself to cracked mirror blight, waiving her initial roll against its CRACKED MIRROR BLIGHT SYMPTOMS Minor Symptom: The victim occasionally slips into surreal, strangely vivid daydreams that recapitulate his nightmares. In addition to standard disease effects, he also suffers the Madness Derangement (Exalted, p. 168) at Minor intensity. Major Symptom: The victim’s Madness rises to Major. He experiences frightening hallucinations on a daily basis, and grows unable to trust his own grasp on reality. Defining Symptom: The victim’s Madness rises to Defining. His nightmarish hallucinations become all but constant and debilitatingly severe. Cracked Mirror Blight never results in death. Virulence. To awaken this Evocation, it must rise to the Defining level.
