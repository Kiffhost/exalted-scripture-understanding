# Devil-Body Apotheosis
Each Infernal Exalt contains the hidden potential for a terrible transformation. In times of great need, the raw Essence of Hell catalyses around their corrupted Exaltation like amber, warping them physically and spiritually into a ruinous and majestic demon form. Devil-Bodies can be almost anything, from a hundred-limbed colossus with an immolating third eye to a ziggurat of ever-growing black glass that drives its victims to despair with its maddening chimes.

The Infernal can enter her Devil-Body reflexively upon suffering damage to a −4 health level. She can also assume her Devil-Body under a circumstance dependent on her Caste (p. XX). The transformation lasts one scene.

While in her Devil-Body, the Infernal’s health track is replaced by an alternative track of (Essence + 7) −0 health levels. If this track is filled with damage, her Devil-Body Apotheosis ends, but none of the damage to these health levels carries over to her true health track.
## Designing Devil-Bodies
Infernal players receive five dots to spend on their character’s Devil-Body, to be spent on a list of powers that range from one to three points. Additionally, a Devil-Body has a package of five dots of [[Merits#Mutations|mutations]] which manifest while transformed. Players are encouraged to work with their Storyteller to come up with a distinctive Devil-Body that they feel accurately reflects their character’s inner demon.
## Dice Pools
Several Devil-Body powers require that the Infernal selects an (Attribute + Ability) pool for the effect. For Attributes, she can pick whichever she wishes. For Abilities, she can choose from [[Archery]], [[Athletics]], [[Brawl]], [[Lore]], [[Linguistics]], [[Martial Arts]], [[Medicine]], [[Melee]], [[Occult]], [[Performance]], [[Presence]], or [[Thrown]].
## Torments
Some Devil-Body powers are marked as Torments. These share a common set of rules for inflicting harmful effects. When the Infernal chooses a Torment, she selects a vector for it:
- **Devil Aura**: An area within short range of the Infernal is exposed to her Torment. Anyone within range at the start of their turn, or who moves into the area during their turn, suffers the Torment unless they avoid it through a limitation the Infernal previously established. This always costs an extra dot.
- **Hellish Touch**: A character is subject to the Torment if she hits him with an attack or touches him, or if he starts his turn grappling or being grappled by her. For an extra dot, the Infernal exposes anyone who hits her with an attack at close range to the Torment.
- **Profane Words**: A character is subject to the Torment if Infernal beats his [[Resolve]] with an influence roll. For an extra dot, anyone within short range who hears the Infernal speak is exposed, even if she doesn’t attempt social influence.
- **Terrible Gaze**: The Infernal can reflexively direct her Torment at an individual within short range once per turn. She rolls (Attribute + Ability) against his [[Guile]], inflicting the Torment on success. For an extra dot, the range extends to long.
- **Other**: Stranger vectors exist, such as glyphic curses that spread through the written word or spiritual vapours that poison those who expend Essence. The limitations and costs of these are subject to the Storyteller’s approval. Generally speaking, they cost an extra dot if they do more than one of the following: reliably target more than one victim per turn, extend beyond short range, or do not require an action to utilize.

The Infernal can also choose a circumstance under which someone can be exempt from her vector, e.g. the Infernal’s aura of heart-searing flame does not burn those with a positive Tie towards her, her rune-body can’t mesmerize illiterate characters, her land-blighting curse can’t touch people in the air. If a nontrivial enemy takes advantage of this weakness during a scene, she gains role experience as if it were a Flaw.

If the Infernal has multiple Torments with the same vector, she can decide that they are both inflicted on the same targets, using the same rolls if necessary.
