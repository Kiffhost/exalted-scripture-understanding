*Shuffling forward in a dizzying series of quicksteps and cartwheels, the dancer follows her enemy’s every step, pursuing the dance towards its conclusion.*
A successful rush lets her move one range band toward her enemy each time he moves away from her until the scene’s end. She loses this benefit if she attacks or rushes another enemy, moves away from that enemy, or is crashed. She can use this Charm to rush from concealment, and its reflexive movement doesn’t require her to make new [[Stealth]] rolls.
