The Sidereal tends to Creation's tattered edges, shoring up the walls of reality. The Sidereal undertakes a superior Craft (Geomancy) project to seal a bordermarch, shadowland, or similar incursion of an otherworldly realm. The project has difficulty 5, terminus 6, and a oneday interval. Its goal number depends on the blighted region's size: [BEGIN TABLE] Size Goal Number A house-sized structure 15 A palace-sized structure, a village, a neighborhood30 A group of villages, a small city, a small forest 50 A small city and surrounding villages, a medium-sized city, a large forest 75 Up to (Essence x100) square miles Equal to square miles [END TABLE] Success seals away the blight, restoring the land to Creation. This lasts for a year and a day, after which the blight reforms at the region's center and begins spreading back to its original boundaries. At the Storyteller's discretion, rituals, wards, geomantic engineering, and other mystical practices may be able to contain the blight after this time expires, potentially even permanently. This is especially true if these measures are based on facts introduced by the players or have been enacted through a successful project (Exalted, p. 226). If the project fails, the Sidereal can't use this Charm on that region again for the rest of the story, and it rages out of control with multiple potential consequences: the blight might spread further, dangerous fae or undead might swarm out of it, local spirits might be corrupted, etc. This Charm normally has no effect on middlemarches of the Wyld, but if all the bordermarches touching on a middlemarch have been sealed, the Sidereal can use it to revert the middlemarch to a bordermarch until the next moon, halving the project's goal number. If she can complete a second use of this Charm before the newly diminished bordermarch reverts, she seal it fully, as above.
