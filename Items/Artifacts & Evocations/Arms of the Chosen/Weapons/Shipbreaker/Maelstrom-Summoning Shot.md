The Exalt fires a bolt so snarled with twisted Water [[Essence]] that when it strikes the waves, it conjures a whirlpool. Used in combat, this is a special attack roll with ([[Dexterity]] + [[Archery]]) that doesn’t target an enemy, but a point in a body of water, creating a whirlpool that extends out to medium range. All characters in the whirlpool, and any character that subsequently moves into it or begins his turn in it, must roll ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) opposing the wielder’s attack roll. On a failed roll, they’re dragged one range band towards the whirlpool’s center and lose ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]], which the wielder gains. A character at the whirlpool’s center begins to drown (Exalted, p. 232), and must succeed on a difficulty 7 ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) roll to escape it, which cannot be placed in a flurry. Uncrewed ships, wharves, and other scenery caught in the whirlpool take an arbitrary amount of damage at the Storyteller’s fiat. If the whirlpool is filled with the debris of crushed scenery, it may become an environmental hazard at the Storyteller’s discretion. In naval combat (Exalted, p, 245), this Evocation lets the wielder make a custom naval stratagem with ([[Wits]] + [[Archery]]) that costs 10 momentum. On a successful stratagem, the targeted ship cannot take any action on its next turn except to roll a positioning stratagem opposing the wielder’s attack roll, but gains no Momentum on a success. On a failed roll, the ship is sucked into the whirlpool and destroyed. Non-trivial characters suffer [[uncountable damage]], though player characters and non-trivial NPCs should always be allowed a roll to escape the ship before it sinks or to attempt to survive the shipwreck. Alternatively, she may roll an [[Escape]] stratagem with ([[Wits]] + [[Archery]]), doubling 7s. Finally, this Evocation can be used to escape a pursuing shipinanavalpursuit(Exalted,p.224),rolledwith([[Wits]] + [[Dexterity]] + Speed) and double 7s. If the wielder’s ship wins the pursuit, the chasing ship must contend with the whirlpool as a naval hazard that requires a difficulty 5 ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]) roll to navigate. On a failed roll, the ship sinks, using the same rules as above. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p, 170) by defeating an aquatic foe or winning a naval combat. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
