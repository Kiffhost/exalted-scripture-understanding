*Rearing up into a stance that makes her seem larger than she actually is, the stylist emulates the movements of an enraged bear.*
The stylist gains the following benefits:  
- She adds a non-Charm success on grapple attack and control rolls.
- She reduces the Initiative cost of grapple gambits by 2.
- She ignores the Defense penalty from grappling.
- She adds (Strength) soak.
## Special activation rules
When the stylist wins control of a clinch against a nontrivial enemy, she may reflexively enter Bear Form.
