The Dragon-Blooded sorcerer shapes Creation’s elemental [[Essence]] by will alone, drawing forth miracles worthy of the Elemental Dragons. This Charm enhances a sorcerous working that creates, strengthens, or controls the elements, such as creating a wall of sorcerous flames, granting a bodyguard a lightning-spitting eye, purifying a river, merging two elementals into a gestalt hybrid, or similar. She gains the following benefits:  
- She adds ([[Essence]]) dice on each roll.
 - The first botch her working suffers has no negative effect.
 - If one of her Hearthmates provides Means for the working—either as a cooperating sorcerer or offering a complementary Ability—she adds an additional +1 to the working’s terminus. She can only gain this benefit once, even if multiple Hearthmates provide Means.
 - If the working is Terrestrial, she adds (Essence/2, rounded up) to the maximum number of dice she can add to each roll, and decreases the working’s experience point cost by two, minimum 1.
