*The unquiet dead call out for justice, and Death’s Lawgiver answers.*
The Abyssal adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on a [[profile character]] roll. For every three extra successes she rolls, she can ask one of the following questions:
 - Is he planning to commit an act of violence? 
 - Who is his greatest enemy among the dead?
 - What has he done to disrespect or anger the dead? 
 - Whose death would hurt him the most? If the [[Storyteller]] doesn’t have an answer in mind, the Abyssal’s player should provide one, as if [[introducing a fact]].
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal can invoke her [[Whispers]] to ask an additional question. She can wait until after using her other questions to do so.
