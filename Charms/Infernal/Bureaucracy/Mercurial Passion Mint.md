*The Infernal sends wild emotions flowing through the stream of commerce, exhaling a many-colored mist that lacquers currency in prismatic passion.*

The Infernal imbues a coin, scrip note, or similar piece of currency with emotion, making a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Bureaucracy) inspire roll. Whenever a character makes a transaction using that coin, all parties to the transaction present in the scene are exposed to the inspire roll. (Theft counts as a transaction.) Each character’s player still chooses how they act on the inspired emotion, but it typically relates to the transaction.

The imbued emotion lasts for a number of transactions equal to the Infernal’s total successes on the influence roll. If all parties to a transaction are trivial characters, that transaction doesn’t count against the limit.
## [[Keys]]
#### Impassioned Commerce Frenzy (Bureaucracy 5) (+4m)
For a four-mote surcharge, Infernal can imbue passion into a specific marketplace or similar centre of commerce, rather than a single coin. She can specify what kinds of transactions trigger her influence: “purchasing dyes,” “buying on credit,” “black market dealings,” and the like. This enchantment ends prematurely if the Infernal leaves that marketplace.
