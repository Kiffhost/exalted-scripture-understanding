*The necromancer draws a pair of gruesome bone-knives from her own hands. Where she casts them, they sprout into thickets of jagged ivory.*
The necromancer creates a pair of bone-knives, which have artifact traits (Exalted, p. 594). They can be thrown out to long range. The necromancer may reflexively throw one of the knives into the ground on her turn, causing a thicket of razor-sharp bones to erupt upward. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round, but she can only do so once per turn. The thicket of bones extends out to short range from where the bone knife fell. It’s difficult terrain and provides heavy cover to those within it or on the other side of it.
Characters caught in the thicket when it erupts or who subsequently enter it suffer an environmental hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round. They don’t need to roll against the hazard in subsequent rounds unless they move through the bone thicket. The ivory razors are sharper than reality, affecting dematerialized creatures normally. The necromancer is unaffected; the bones bend and blunt around her to grant safe passage.
THOUSAND-CORPSE GOLIATH Nearly forty feet in height, a thousand-corpse goliath is a skeletal nightmare of soulsteel and bone, covered in thousands of handholds and spikes. When directed, zombies climb onto the body, impaling themselves on spikes and grasping handholds to act as the construct’s corpse-muscle, strapped onto its body to maintain its integrity. Its massive metal fists break fortifications, it can crush a company of soldiers beneath its ironclad feet.

The construct must be equipped with zombies before battle, taking about an hour to fully load the corpse-engine. Once loaded, the zombies cannot act independently, but they reinforce the goliath’s might, adding the loaded battle group’s (Size) to attack rolls, grapple rolls, feats of strength, soak, and Hardness. With Size 3+ zombies loaded on, the goliath doubles 8s on Feats of Strength. Once the goliath has arrived on the field of battle, it may spend two rounds disgorging all the zombies on its frame, but once this is done, they cannot be loaded back on quickly.
### Blood of Writhing Corpses
The goliath may sacrifice dots of Size from its loaded zombies to take a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201), shedding zombies to deflect a lethal blow to its inner components. This negates two levels of damage per dot of Size. Area of effect attacks that inflict 5+ levels of decisive damage destroy enough zombies to lower the Size of the loaded zombies by one. Once per battle, while loaded with a Size 2+ group of zombies, the goliath may reflexively shed a Size 1 battle group of zombies with poor Drill and Might 1 at its feet whenever it takes 3+ levels of decisive damage.
### Dead Passenger Reprisal
While loaded with a Size 3+ group of zombies, the goliath’s outer layer of corpses attacks any enemies attempting to grapple it, climb it, or attack it from close range with a weapon without the Reaching tag. They inflict one die of unsoakable withering damage at the start of each of the goliath’s turns. The goliath doesn’t gain Initiative from this. Crashed enemies suffer one die of lethal damage instead, ignoring Hardness.
### Legendary Size
The construct suffers no onslaught penalties from attacks from smaller opponents unless they’re magically inflicted. Withering attacks from smaller enemies cannot crash it unless they have at least 10 post-soak damage dice, although attackers still gain the full amount of Initiative damage dealt. Decisive attacks from smaller enemies cannot deal more than (3 + attacker’s Strength) levels of damage to it, not counting levels added by Charms or other magic.
### Mindless
The construct treats all social influence as unacceptable.
### Special Abilities Legion-Crushing Stomp
The goliath gains Initiative equal to the (Size) of its loaded zombies, then makes a decisive stomp attack against all enemies within close range. It splits Initiative evenly between them for damage, rounded up. Once per scene THOUSAND-CORPSE GOLIATH (CONTINUED) If a thicket causes at least three levels of damage to living characters, the blood nourishes them to take root, making them a permanent feature of the landscape; otherwise, they crumble after a day.
## Control
Bones begin to grow in the necromancer’s presence, budding off into skeletal trees and vines of hanging tarsals. Her bone thickets are always permanent. She can reflexively draw another bone-knife from a thicket within close range on her turn, though it won’t burst into another thicket when thrown.
## Distortion (10)
A thicket within medium range begins to shrink back into the soil, reducing its difficulty and Damage by two each and its cover to light. While it’s distorted, the necromancer isn’t immune to it.
