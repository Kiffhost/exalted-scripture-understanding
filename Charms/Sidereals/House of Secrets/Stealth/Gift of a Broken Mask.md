*The Sidereal affixes a violet memorandum designating someone an honorary member of the Fivescore Fellowship to his brow, bringing him under the Maskâ€™s obscure dominion.*
The Sidereal touches someone and rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Stealth]]) opposing his ({Appearance or Charisma} + [[Presence]]) roll. If successful, he suffers [[arcane fate]] (p. XX) for (1 + extra successes) months, or that many days for supernatural beings. While only Sidereals can create resplendent destinies, the Storyteller should reward creative use of magic. A Solar might approximate a resplendent destiny by using [[Heart-Eclipsing Shroud]] and Flawlessly Impenetrable [[Disguise]] together, etc.
