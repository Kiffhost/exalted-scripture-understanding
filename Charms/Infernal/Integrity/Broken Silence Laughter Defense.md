*The Infernal delights in the absurd comedy that is the world, laughing uproariously in her enlightenment.*

The Infernal breaks out into inappropriate or unnerving laughter as a character makes an influence roll against her, adding (Essence) to her Resolve against it. She gains a Minor Intimacy expressing her amusement or delight at the opposing character’s foolish babble, which automatically counts as opposing that influence. This defense isn’t limited to spoken influence — the Infernal can laugh away written influence and psychic intrusions just as easily.

If the Infernal hasn’t made any other vocal utterances in the scene, the Resolve bonus is non-Charm.
