*Distilling her killing intent into venomous [[Essence]], the Snake master delivers a blow as quick as lightning and as deadly as the strike of a dozen serpents.*
[[Essence Venom Strike]] poisons an enemy, envenoming him as long as a single level of damage is dealt. The poison deals one die of aggravated damage each round and inflicts a -2 penalty, with one round of duration for every two dice of raw damage rolled. Characters in [[Initiative]] Crash do not receive a ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll to lower the duration of the poison. An enemy poisoned with this Charm is treated as having a lower [[Initiative]] than the martial artist for the purposes of [[Essence Fangs and Scales Technique]], [[Snake Form]], and [[Striking Cobra Technique]] until the venom has run its course. 
## Terrestrial
When used by a Dragon-Blood, the duration of the poison created by this Charm can be no higher than five rounds. 
## Mastery
Once an enemy has been poisoned by the martial artist’s [[Essence Venom Strike]], she can advance its progress with precise strikes to [[Essence]] meridians and pressure points. Damaging the poisoned enemy with a withering attack causes one die of that poison’s remaining damage to be immediately rolled and applied against his health track; decisive attacks increase this to ([[Essence]]) dice. Applying damage early does not reduce the duration of this Charm. If an enemy has five rounds of poison remaining, and the martial artist causes him to roll three dice of damage with an attack, then he would continue taking damage from the poison for two rounds, then spend three rounds only taking the penalty from it.
