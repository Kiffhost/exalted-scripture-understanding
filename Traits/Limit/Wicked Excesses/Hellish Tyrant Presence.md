That mortals and lesser beings would not join the Infernal’s cause is unthinkable. She attempts to coerce, suborn, or otherwise demand support, patronage, or service from others, resorting to violence in the case of serious opposition. If she receives compliance the Infernal becomes determined to put her allies and subjects to use, devising taxing and strenuous tasks for her new minions.

**Duration**: Session.
Hellish Tyrant Presence can end prematurely if the Infernal is bested in some way by those she is attempting to subjugate.
