Homing in on her foe’s weakness, the Lunar looses a perfect shot. When aiming to attack foes within medium range who are crashed or have a −2 or greater wound penalty, she also adds dice from aiming. If she’d normally add dice, they become non-Charm successes. This Charm ends if the Lunar is crashed. If the Lunar uses [[Hunter’s Eye Precision]] on the same turn she uses this Charm, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has a vision-enhancing Merit may learn this as a [[Perception]] Charm.
