The Lunar’s limbs wrap her prey tight in an inescapable prison of muscle. The Defense penalty for clinching is lowered by one point, and she doesn’t lose rounds of control when she’s attacked or damaged by lower-Initiative enemies. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Crushing Coils, the Lunar never loses rounds of control for being attacked or damaged.
