The Sidereal promotes a god to a position within the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], presenting him with a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden in Chains for his signature, upon which it burns away in a gout of emerald fire. The Sidereal assigns a god a position instantly and unquestionably, effected by the Celestial Bureaucracy’s very [[Essence]]. The position can’t already be occupied — the Sidereal must choose either a vacant office or a position that does not yet exist. The god must willingly accept the promotion. If he already held a position in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], the two are folded together into a single office; unemployed gods simply step into their new role. Upon being promoted, the god gains the following benefits: 
-  An additional dot of [[Essence]], maximum (Sidereal’s [[Essence]]). 
-  A Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of diligently fulfilling the duties he’s been appointed to. 
-  Up to six dots of [[Merits]] reflecting his new position. This typically includes [[Backing]], [[Resources]], and the like, but can also include mutations. 
-  (God’s [[Essence]]) new [[Charms]] reflecting his new position. These don’t manifest immediately; [[Charms]] are only gained once the Sidereal’s player and the Storyteller have agreed on how they work. 
-  If the Sidereal knows [[Godly Companion]] (p. XX), the promoted god becomes her familiar. While the promotion is intrinsically legitimate in Heaven’s eyes, it’s not irrevocable; the god can still be demoted or fired. Bureaucratic restructurings may eliminate the appointed position entirely if its existence is called into question and can’t be justified, though this is unlikely unless a Sidereal invents particularly implausible offices. This Charm can be used on elementals, though they gain no benefits other than the Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] and status as a familiar. Sidereals with [[Charms/Sidereals/House of Secrets/Occult/Celestial Circle Sorcery]] can offer employment demons, a power known as An End to Darkness. They receive the same benefits as elementals and cease to be creatures of darkness and enemies of fate while employed.
