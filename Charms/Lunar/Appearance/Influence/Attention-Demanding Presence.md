Magnifying her presence, the Lunar stands at the center of attention. Any characters that can see her suffer a −(Lunar’s Appearance − his Resolve) penalty, minimum −1, on Perception rolls, except those opposing her Stealth. A character that botches a penalized roll forms a Minor Tie of desire or fear, as appropriate, toward the Lunar (or her current shape). However, the Lunar takes a −3 penalty on Stealth rolls.
