The Dragon-Blood bids Creation serve her, and the elements answer the Prince of the Earth. To use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must be within close range of a dramatic and significant manifestation of an element, such as a windstorm, grove, cliffside, or river. She draws up its [[Essence]] and shapes it into a weak elemental servant with the following traits.
 - The base traits of any one-dot [[Familiar]] (Exalted, p. 161), or of either an elite troop or an assassin (Exalted, pp. 497, 499). The weapons listed for these traits represent the elemental’s natural weapons, rather than literal weaponry.
 - Up to (Dragon-Blood’s [[Essence]]) dots of mutations that represent its elemental nature.
 - A Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to the Dragon-Blood and, optionally, a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] chosen by the Storyteller based on the element it’s created from.
 - [[Essence]] 1, an [[Essence]] pool of sixty motes, and the Hurry Home Charm (Exalted, p. 509), allowing it to return to the Dragon-Blood’s side for ten motes and one [[Willpower]].
 - The elemental is more intelligent than most animals, though not as intelligent as the average human. It isn’t capable of speech and can’t understand complex commands or statements.
 - If the Dragon-Blood knows [[Elemental Bond Meditation]] (p. 148), the created elemental counts as a familiar, although it doesn’t count toward the maximum number of elemental familiars she can have.
 - If the elemental travels more than (Dragon-Blood’s [[Essence]]) miles from her, it dissipates into nothingness and this Charm ends.
While the elemental created by this Charm ceases to exist once this Charm ends, if any of the players are particularly invested in an elemental as a character, its consciousness, personality, memories, and [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] may carry over to subsequent uses of this Charm to create another elemental of the same element.
This Charm’s aspect is the same as that of the elemental created.
