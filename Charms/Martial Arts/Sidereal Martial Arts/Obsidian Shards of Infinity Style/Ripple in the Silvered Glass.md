*Perception is inextricable from reality; space and time are illusions obscuring the truth.*
The stylist can use this Charm on her turn to reveal that a character within medium range of her has actually been somewhere within short range of his apparent location all along. Any appearances to the contrary were but a trick of perspective. This can move characters into environmental hazards and other disadvantageous terrain, but it must leave them with a place to stand — the stylist can’t move them off a cliff, for instance.
In battle, the Obsidian Shards stylist breathes with a steady rhythm, is constantly aware of all possible angles of attack, and makes no unnecessary movement.
Every mirror is a weapon to them; thus, they keep their blades well-polished and choose the sites of their ambushes wisely.
### Obsidian Shards of Infinity Weapons
This style emphasizes knifehand strikes, often delivered two handed; rapid successions of kicks; and joint locks. It’s compatible with khatars, sai, and knives, which are traditionally dual wielded. Unarmed attacks enhanced with this style’s Charms can be stunted to deal lethal damage.
Against an unwilling character, the stylist must make a difficulty 3 gambit with (Perception + Martial Arts) opposed by her target’s (Manipulation + Integrity) roll to use this effect. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round.
If the stylist can see a target in a reflective surface, she can use this Charm on him as long as he’s within (Essence) range bands.
### Enlightenment
Upon winning Join Battle, the stylist can use this Charm any number of times, waiving the Willpower cost of uses past the first. She doesn’t need to make gambits against unwilling targets unless she moves them into an environmental hazard or similar peril.
## Reset
Once per turn.
