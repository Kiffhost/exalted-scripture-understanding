This gemstone’s appearance varies depending on the angle from which it’s viewed — blue or green, bright or dull, clear or opaque. Socketed in an attuned artifact, it grants access to the following Evocations:
Frozen Sorcery: Emerald
Cost: 10m, 1wp; Mins: Essence 1
Type: Reflexive
Keywords: None
Duration: Instant
Prerequisites: None
With a warding gesture, the bearer halts a just-cast Terrestrial Circle spell that either targets her directly or encompasses her within its initial area of effect, freezing the magic in its tracks. She may attempt to shatter the frozen spell as a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried. This requires a (Wits + Occult) roll against difficulty (caster’s Essence + 3). A success shatters the frozen spell, countering it. If she doesn’t attempt this action or fails the roll, the spell thaws out at the beginning of her next turn, before she acts, and goes off as intended. This Evocation can only be used once per scene. Frozen Sorcery: Sapphire
Cost: 20m, 1wp; Mins: Essence 3
Type: Reflexive
Keywords: None
Duration: Instant
Prerequisites: Frozen Sorcery: Emerald
This Evocation functions as Frozen Sorcery: Emerald, except that it freezes a spell of the Celestial Circle, the difficulty is (caster’s Essence + 5), and it can only be used once per story. This resets at the end of any scene in which the bearer defeats, suborns, or makes peace with an enemy sorcerer. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
