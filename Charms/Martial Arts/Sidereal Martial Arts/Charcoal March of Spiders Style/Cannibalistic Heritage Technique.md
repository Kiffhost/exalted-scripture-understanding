*The martial artist moves her hands in swirling motions, creating a hungry vortex of whirling cobwebs and spiritual pressure and whirling cobwebs to devour an enemy’s attack.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have [[Initiative]] 20+. 
She reflexively clashes an attack against her with this vortex as a decisive attack. She can do so against attacks made from any range, but she only rolls damage on a successful clash if her attacker is within close range — or, if [[Rain of Unseen Threads]] is active, medium range. If the stylist wins the clash, the vortex engulfs and consumes her attacker’s weapon or projectile. Mundane hand-to-hand weapons are destroyed entirely while artifacts are corroded and damaged to the point of being unusable until repaired (Exalted, p. 242). If her attacker was unarmed, he must instead choose between accepting a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201) to the limb used to attack or adding his attack roll successes as damage dice to the stylist’s clash. If he takes a crippling injury, it doesn’t count against the once-per-story limit on doing so.
If [[Charcoal March of Spiders Form]] is active, the stylist may choose to combine more than one of her multiple [[Initiative]] tracks to determine her clash’s damage. She chooses one track to keep, resetting if she succeeds or losing [[Initiative]] if she misses; the other tracks she used are expended as if crashed.
