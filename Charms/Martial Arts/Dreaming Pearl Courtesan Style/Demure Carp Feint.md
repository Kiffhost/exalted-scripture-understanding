*The Dreaming Pearl Courtesan dances away from the blows of her enemies without effort, as if her body was nothing more than so many cherry blossoms caught on the wind.* 
[[Demure Carp Feint]] adds +1 to the martial artist’s [[Defense|Evasion]], or adds one success on a roll to disengage. If the martial artist’s [[Appearance]] is higher than the [[Resolve]] of her attacker, or of all enemies she is disengaging from, this increases to +2. Successfully defending against or disengaging from an enemy whose [[Resolve]] is beaten by the martial artist’s [[Appearance]] grants her a point of [[Initiative]], as her provocative elegance and sinuous grace gain her an improved footing. 
## Mastery
When the martial artist gains [[Initiative]] with this Charm, her attacker loses a point of [[Initiative]] as well. When disengaging, all enemies whose [[Resolve]] is beaten lose the point of [[Initiative]] (although this does not increase the amount the martial artist receives).
