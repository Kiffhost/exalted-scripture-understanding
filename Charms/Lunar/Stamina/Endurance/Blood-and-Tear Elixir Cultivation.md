*The Lunar distills potent medicines and antivenins from her body.*
She secretes a single dose of medicine, which is exceptional equipment (Exalted, p.580) to treat a specific malady. If the disease or poison treated is one the Lunar’s previously suffered, the medicine also adds (higher of Lunar’s [[Essence]] or 3) dice on a roll to treat it. If the medicine is applied by the Lunar or her Solar mate, these dice are non-Charm.
If the Lunar has a [[Craft]] related to making medicines, she receives craft points for meeting objectives with this Charm as though she’d completed a basic project (Exalted, p. 240). 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is venomous or poisonous may learn this as an [[Intelligence]] Charm, with [[Night’s Mercy Panacea]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
