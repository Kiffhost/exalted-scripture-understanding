*When traveling through, over, or across water — including jumping to and from shipboard, the shore, etc.*
— the costs of the following [[Charms]] are reduced by two motes and their [[Willpower]] costs are waived: [[Feather Foot Style]], [[Racing Hare Method]], and [[Mountain-Crossing Leap Technique]] (Exalted, pp. 263-265). The Exalt may spend the rest of an above Charm’s cost at any time to gain its full functionality. While using these [[Charms]], a swimming wielder can breach the surface and start running or jumping without a stunt.
