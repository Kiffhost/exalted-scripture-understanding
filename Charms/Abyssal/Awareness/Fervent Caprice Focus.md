*Driven by obsession, the Abyssal discovers dark truths beyond mortal ken.*
The Abyssal can pay a one-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Morbid Inspiration Witness]] to heighten her obsession, letting her spend banked successes on the following effects. She must use them in a way that advances her creative goal or directly relates to it.
1 success: Add one mote toward the cost of a [[Craft]], [[Linguistics]], [[Medicine]], [[Occult]], or [[Performance]] Charm.
2 successes: When the Abyssal creates an undead or completes a [[Craft]] project, she may reveal a small but useful quirk in her creation: a zombie’s teeth have been capped with iron, a daiklave’s pommel houses a useful storage compartment, the antidote she brewed is highly flammable, etc..
3 successes: Add (higher of [[Essence]] or 5) silver craft points or ([[Essence]]) gold points toward the cost of a [[Craft]] project or [[Craft]] Charm.
3 successes: Challenge or introduce a fact using one of the Abyssal’s Crafts or a specialty in [[Craft]], [[Linguistics]], [[Medicine]], [[Occult]] or [[Performance]] as a [[Lore]] background.
5 successes: Add one [[Willpower]] toward the cost of a [[Craft]], [[Linguistics]], [[Medicine]], [[Occult]], or [[Performance]] Charm.
5 successes: Waive the [[Willpower]] cost of resisting influence that opposes the Abyssal’s Principle from [[Morbid Inspiration Witness]].
