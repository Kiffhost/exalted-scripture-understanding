*The Abyssal lunges towards and past her foe in a single perfect motion, glancing over her shoulder to watch her victim’s corpse split in half.*
To use this Charm, the Abyssal must have [[Initiative]] 6+. She can attack a lower-[[Initiative]] enemy within medium range, instantly dashing into close range before she strikes. She doubles a withering attack’s post-soak damage or adds ([[Essence]]) dice of damage on a decisive attack. This uses her movement action.
This Charm is incompatible with jumping, flying, and other forms of movement other than running.
