*Witnessing the Abyssal’s impossible might, her victims know that their time is nigh.*
The Abyssal treats a successful feat of strength roll as a threaten roll against any number of characters who witnessed it. If the feat required Strength 5+, all targets suffer −1 Resolve against this influence.
In combat, this influence costs one Initiative to resist, in addition to the usual cost.
