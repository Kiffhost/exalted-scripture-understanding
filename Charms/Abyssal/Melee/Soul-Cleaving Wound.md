*The Abyssal’s weapon maims spirit and flesh alike.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after making a decisive damage roll, letting her forgo levels of damage to inflict one or more of the effects below. She must still deal at least one level of damage.
Conviction-Maiming Strike (1 level): The Abyssal wounds her victim’s higher soul as a Psyche effect. Any Intimacies he has that aren’t based on emotion count as one step weaker. If he doesn’t have any, he loses one Willpower instead.
Essence-Bleeding Cut (3 levels): The Abyssal scars her victim’s very Essence, causing him to lose motes equal to the damage roll’s successes. He treats his Essence as one lower for magic that uses it in calculations and reduces the number of motes he regains each round in combat or each hour outside of it by one. He reduces them both by two instead while suffering a –2 or higher wound or crippling penalty. Enemies without mote pools instead fall unconscious for the rest of the scene.
Will-Devouring Edge (3 levels): The Abyssal’s victim loses a point of Willpower and a dot of permanent Willpower. If this reduces his permanent Willpower to 0, he falls unconscious for the rest of the scene. The first time he spends Willpower in a scene, he must pay an additional point, and he can’t recover Willpower from rest.
Passion-Severing Slash (1 level): The Abyssal maims her victim’s lower soul as a Psyche effect. Any Intimacies he has that are based on emotion count as one step weaker. If he doesn’t have any, he loses one Willpower instead.
For most characters, these spiritual wounds require magic to heal, often Medicine or Occult Charms.
Characters with Exalted Healing recover from them after a full day of convalescence.
