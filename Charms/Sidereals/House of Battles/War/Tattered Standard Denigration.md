*The Sidereal’s strategy extends beyond the battlefield, decimating her enemy’s ranks not with force of arms but with boasts and rumors.*
The Sidereal undermines a military leader’s reputation among his subordinates over the course of a few hours spent sowing rumors among them, openly mocking or satirizing the leader to them, or otherwise attacking his reputation.
She rolls ({Charisma or Manipulation} + War) opposing the leader’s ({Appearance or Charisma} + War) roll.
If successful, the Sidereal sows distrust among the ranks. Any subordinates whose Resolve is beaten by the Sidereal’s roll weaken any positive Tie toward him by one step. Those without positive Ties instead gain a Minor Tie of distrust or strengthen an existing negative Tie by one step. They can resist for one Willpower.
As long as the Sidereal beats any subordinates’ Resolve, she undermines the leader’s reputation. He suffers the following
- +1 target number on command actions and on influence rolls against his subordinates that involve leading them or maintaining a good reputation with them. This also applies on Strategic Maneuver rolls if his chosen stratagem would be hindered by disloyal subordinates. This always applies to Strategic Maneuver rolls opposing Demoralize stratagems.
- Once per story, the Sidereal’s player can inflict a botch on one of the above rolls, even if the Sidereal isn’t present.
- His subordinates can’t use positive Ties to him to bolster their Resolve against the Sidereal’s social influence, nor can they cite them in Decision Points against her. Even those who spent Willpower to resist suffer this effect.
- The Sidereal waives the cost to use Descending (Caste) Horoscope Charms on him.
The leader can restore his reputation by winning a noteworthy victory over the Sidereal — in battle, debate, business, or any other venue. He can also reclaim it by leading his forces to victory in a battle in a way that accomplishes a significant goal or demonstrates his worthiness to his troops.
If the Sidereal knows Battalion-Bureau Leadership (p.
248), this Charm expands to all forms of leadership. She could use it to undermine a criminal kingpin’s standing among his henchmen or cast doubt on a Guild merchant prince’s ability to pay his hired mercenaries. Instead of opposing the Sidereal’s roll with War, they use the Ability most germane to their leadership. They face an increased target number on rolls with that Ability that involve interacting with subordinates rather than on command and Strategic Maneuver rolls. They can restore their reputations with an accomplishment in their field comparable to a victory in battle.
## Special activation rules
The Sidereal can use this Charm reflexively when she defeats a military leader in battle. He doesn’t get to make an opposed roll. If she uses Heroic Exploit Propagation, she waives its Willpower cost and can cause affected characters to gain a Minor Tie of disrespect toward the leader instead of one of her own Intimacies.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).
