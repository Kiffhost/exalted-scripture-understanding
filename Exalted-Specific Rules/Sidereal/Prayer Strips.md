Each Sidereal Ability has a capstone Charm requiring any 10 Charms of the Ability; these make use of a prayer strip bearing the scripture associated with that Ability’s constellation, an enigmatic poem, story, or koan of unknown origin.
Sidereals are assumed to have any prayer strips they may need, whether in trendy jade or ivory cases or wadded up in a pocket, unless specifically denied access to them. Creating a prayer strip is a difficulty 2 basic craft project rolled with (Dexterity + [an appropriate Craft or Linguistics]), which takes a few minutes. This can be done as a miscellaneous action at a −4 penalty. Prayer strips in use with a Charm are indestructible unless specified otherwise.
