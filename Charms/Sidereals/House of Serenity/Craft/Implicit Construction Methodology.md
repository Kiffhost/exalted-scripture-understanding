Contemplating her design, the Sidereal braids a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of Lover and Maiden around her wrist; it transforms into a band of cold blue light, a sign of the world’s favor. The Sidereal blesses a superior project to create an artifact, paying one white point per dot of its rating. So long as she has the necessary tools and materials, the project completes itself without requiring her to roll, pay any further craft points, or use a project slot. The amount of time this takes depends on the artifact’s rating: BEGIN TABLE Artifact Rating Time 2 (6 – Craft [Artifact]) hours 3 (6 – Craft [Artifact]) days 4 (6 – Craft [Artifact]) weeks 5 (6 – Craft [Artifact]) months END TABLE This Charm can also be used to create a manse atop a demesne; this takes (6 – Craft [Geomancy]) months for a three-dot manse or (15 – Craft [Geomancy]) months for a 5-dot manse. It can’t create N/A-rated artifacts or manses or First Age artifice. This Charm doesn’t award craft points; it is the world that is inspired, not the Sidereal.
