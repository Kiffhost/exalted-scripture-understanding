The Solar pours the cold instinct of her training into a blade, suffusing it with stifling Essence. This Charm supplements a decisive attack, silencing the struck target up to (Essence) turns. A victim of this attack cannot produce sound. He can neither cry out nor raise alarm, nor will his fist through a window produce the sound of shattered glass, nor will his body plummeting from the rooftops to the street make even the tiniest sound of thud or splatter. Characters thus affected may not be detected by any hearing-based Awareness, and those who are killed will die in an unnoticeable fashion, determined by the Storyteller: they may die standing up, reclining naturally, or their bodies may simply fall soundlessly out of sight. In any case, the targetâ€™s death cannot be discovered until the effects of Mist on Water Attack have passed.
