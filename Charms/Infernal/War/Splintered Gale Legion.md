*The Infernal screams out a swirling crimson mist, birthing bloody splinters of herself as Adorjan once brought forth her daughters of flesh and wind.*

The Infernal makes a difficulty 1 ({Appearance, Charisma, or Intelligence} + War) roll to create a battle group made up of her own duplicates. The battle group starts with Size 1, plus an additional dot of Size for every three extra successes. It has elite Drill, Might 1, and perfect morale.

The Infernal’s wound penalty doesn’t apply on command actions targeting the battle group. She can take one level of aggravated damage to target it with a rally for numbers action despite its perfect morale, replenishing its ranks from her own flesh.
