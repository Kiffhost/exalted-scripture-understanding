*Wayward divinities and unrighteous spirits are tinder for the flames of righteousness.*
The Immaculate’s decisive attacks deal aggravated damage to spirits, and she treats her [[Initiative]] as ([[Essence]]) higher for the purposes of this style’s [[Charms]] or similar effects that gain benefits against lower-[[Initiative]] foes. If she deals damage, she ignites the spirit’s [[Essence]], rolling ([[Essence]]) dice of aggravated damage on its next turn, ignoring [[Hardness]]. Dematerialized spirits are more easily consumed, suffering ([[Essence]] + 2) dice instead.
