With this Charm, the Lawgiver may bolster the mind and spirit of her charge, lifting him up with inner strength. Upon paying this Charm’s cost, the Exalt may transfer up to her Essence in temporary Willpower to another character. In addition, roll a single die and add any successes to the recipient’s Willpower. The Exalt must always transfer at least one point of Willpower from herself to her target when using this Charm. Will-Bolstering Method can explicitly increase a character past his maximum Willpower, and even past a rating of ten.
