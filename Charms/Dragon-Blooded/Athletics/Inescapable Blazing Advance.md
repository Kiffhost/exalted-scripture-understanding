As the Dragon-Blood runs, flames streak behind her like scarlet ribbons as she builds to her utmost speed, incinerating those left in her wake. She adds (Essence) non-Charm dice on a rush. (Essence) 1s on the opposing character’s roll strip one point of Initiative each from him, which the Dragon-Blood gains. WhenthisInitiativelosscrashesanenemy,theDragon-Blood’s speed is such that her fiery wake literally sets him ablaze. He catches fire, suffering (the Initiative he lost) dice of Hardness-ignoring lethal damage on each of his turns. This lasts until he successfully extinguishes himself.
