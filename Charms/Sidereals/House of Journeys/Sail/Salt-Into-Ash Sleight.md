*Clapping her hands, the Sidereal wreathes a spirit in an aura of yellow fire, an omen presaging a sudden journey.*
The Sidereal makes a special (Charisma + Sail) persuade roll against a spirit within medium range. Water elementals and other spirits associated with water count as having a Major Intimacy supporting this influence.
If the Sidereal succeeds, that spirit recalls some unfinished business he has in another place. It presses increasingly on his mind, imposing a −3 penalty on any rolls he makes that don’t directly aid in attending to that matter. The unfinished business isn’t created by the Sidereal; rather, this Charm provides a narrative guarantee that the spirit does have some such unfinished business to attend to. The Storyteller chooses its nature, which the Sidereal doesn’t learn.
Once the scene ends, the urgency of the spirit’s business becomes unbearable. He must immediately set off toward that location and attend to his unfinished business, if possible, for at least (10 – his Willpower) hours before he can stop; Willpower 10 spirits must spend at least five minutes before they can stop.
Resisting this requires a Decision Point. The spirit must cite an Intimacy of equal or greater intensity to the one that supported the Sidereal’s influence and pay one Willpower.
