*As Nightbane’s master lays eyes on a wicked monster clothed in human skin, or an otherworldly devil whose very presence taints the world, she looses an arrow wreathed in transformative [[Essence]], cursing her foe with a shape better suited to his dark heart.*
She makes a decisive attack against an enemy she’s witnessed acting against one of her Defining Principles, a creature of darkness, or a fae, adding attack roll extra successes as dice of damage. If this incapacitates her foe or deals at least (his [[Willpower]]) damage, he’s permanently transformed into an animal of her choice (except Legendary [[Size]] or Minuscule [[Size]] animals) as a shaping effect (p. XX). This functions like Lunar shapeshifting (p. XX), except that the victim’s physical actions use the lower of his or the animal’s dice pool or static value (3 dice if the animal has no listed pool). His intellect isn’t diminished, though must use the lower of his or the animal’s [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]]. If the wielder knows [[Insidious Lunar Transformation]] (p. XX), she need only deal (his current temporary [[Willpower]]) damage to transform him. This Evocation can only be used once per day. Using it against trivial foes doesn’t count towards this limit and waives its [[Willpower]] cost. 
## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by characters resonant with [[Nightbane]].
