*Zelator’s blade flares in the face of dark magic, reflecting it back at the unrighteous.*
The Exalt may activate this Evocation when she is the only target of a non-physical ranged attack such as [[Sandstorm-Wind Attack]], [[Flight of the Brilliant Raptor]], or a bloodape’s Shattering Roar. If she successfully parries that attack, she may redirect it at its source, no matter the range. A redirected withering attack strips [[Initiative]] from the enemy who made it and awards it to the wielder. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder incapacitates a non-trivial foe with a baneful decisive attack. 

## Resonant

This Evocation can be used after an attack is rolled.
