The Infernal can drain her opponent’s soul with her touch, drink his blood through spindly proboscis, or otherwise siphon his vitality. She chooses whether she can drain Essence, health levels, or Willpower when this power is selected:
- **Essence**: When the Infernal deals 2+ decisive damage, she steals a mote of Essence from her victim for every two levels of damage dealt, maximum (target’s Essence). Alternatively, she can make a gambit at difficulty (target’s Essence) to drain (his Essence) motes.
- **Health**: When the Infernal deals 3+ decisive damage, she heals one non-aggravated health level for every three levels of damage dealt, maximum (higher of her Essence or 3).
- **Willpower**: When the Infernal deals 4+ decisive damage, she steals a point of Willpower from her victim for every four levels of damage dealt, maximum (higher of her Essence or 3). She can make a difficulty 3 gambit to steal one point of Willpower.

A two-dot version lets the Infernal drain all three qualities, though she can only siphon one per attack.
