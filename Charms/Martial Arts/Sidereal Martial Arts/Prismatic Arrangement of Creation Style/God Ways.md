*The martial artist dissolves into pure spirit, coiling around a victim’s soul or pouring her [[Essence]] into an object.*
The stylist makes a ([[Charisma]] + {Lore or Occult}) gambit against the [[Resolve]] of an enemy within short range. Its difficulty is 5 against mortals and trivial characters and (higher of [[Willpower]] or 7) for others. If successful, the stylist dematerializes and possesses that character. She can’t take actions herself, but dictates target’s actions, including spending his motes and [[Willpower]] on [[Charms]] or other magic. This lasts until the Sidereal has taken ([[Essence]]) turns while possessing him. If she tries to force a character to violate one of his Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he regains control of his own actions until his next turn. If the martial artist’s anima flares, it shines through her host, making him seem to be Exalted. 
Alternatively, the martial artist can possess a mundane object, rolling ([[Charisma]] + [[Martial Arts]]) against difficulty 1 for objects that could be held in one hand, 3 for objects the size of a person, or 5 for objects the size of a wagon. Anything larger can’t be possessed. Success lets her dematerialize and inhabit it. She can still act using her own traits, lending the object whatever animation and flexibility is necessary to do so. This lasts until she’s taken ([[Essence]]) turns or ([[Essence]]) non-reflexive actions outside of combat. Any damage or harmful effects that befall a possessed character or object don’t apply to the martial artist; magic capable of attacking dematerialized characters is necessary to harm her.
## Enlightenment
The martial artist can use this Charm for ten motes and one [[Willpower]] to dematerialize for one scene without possessing anything.
