Cutting a swath across the battlefield, the Lunar creates openings for her warriors to rush in. After landing a withering attack, she can use this Charm to grant an allied battle group a dice bonus on its next damage roll equal to half her successes on the withering damage roll, rounded up. This bonus is lost if the battle group doesnâ€™t attack on its next turn. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a Strength Charm.
