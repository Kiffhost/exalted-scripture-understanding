The Sidereal is an enigmatic figure roaming Creation, offering her wisdom to those who join her on the road. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  Anyone journeying with her or evaluating potential guides, crew, passengers, or other companions assume she has knowledge useful to the journey. This counts as a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]]. 
-  Once per day, she may grant someone following her advice −1 target number on a [[Ride]], [[Sail]], or [[Survival]] roll. 
-  Rolls to uncover how she came to be aboard a ship, with a group of travelers, etc. suffer +1 target number. Trivial characters automatically fail such rolls. 
-  When she and her traveling companions sleep, she senses if any of them suffer from baleful magic. She doesn’t learn the victim’s identity but adds ([[Essence]]) dice on rolls to follow up on this. Discovering and curing the affliction counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
