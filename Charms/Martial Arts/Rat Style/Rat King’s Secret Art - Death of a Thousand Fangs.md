---
*The Rat master strikes from every direction, an all-consuming blur of steel and shed blood.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have [[Initiative]] 10+. She makes two decisive attacks against a single enemy, plus additional attacks as below, to a maximum of ([[Wits]] + 1).
 - Against diseased enemies, additional attacks equal to the disease’s intensity.
 - An additional attack if she attacks from concealment, or two more attacks for an ambush.
 - An additional attack if she’s disengaged from her target since her last turn.
 - An additional attack while in [[Rat Form]].
The stylist’s [[Initiative]] doesn’t reset normally — instead, after each attack, she loses one [[Initiative]] for each die that shows a success on the damage roll. This can’t reduce her below her base [[Initiative]].
If the stylist attacks from concealment, she doesn’t lose it until she’s completed this flurry, giving all her attacks the benefit of being unexpected.
## Special activation rules
The stylist can use this Charm reflexively with [[Red-Eyes-Darting Strike]], applying its benefits to each attack.
## Mastery
Each successful attack adds one die of damage to all successive attacks.
## Terrestrial
The stylist can’t make more than ([[Essence]] + 1) attacks, maximum 6.
