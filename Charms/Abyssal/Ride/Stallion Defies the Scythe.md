*The deathknight’s mount weathers all peril in its unceasing labors, unbowed even by fatal blows.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a damage roll against her mount, sparing it from brunt of the blow.
If a withering attack would crash it, it’s left with one Initiative instead. If a decisive attack would incapacitate it, any damage to its Incapacitated level is negated.
The deathknight can’t save her mount from being crashed if it already has one Initiative or fewer, nor can she protect it from incapacitation if it only has its last health level left.
