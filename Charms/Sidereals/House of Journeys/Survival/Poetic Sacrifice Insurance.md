The Sidereal reminds the world of the great sacrifices she must one day make in its service, winning a reprieve from her current suffering. The Sidereal can use this Charm when she fails a roll with any Ability against an environmental hazard, trap, or similar danger or to navigate a marine hazard (Exalted, p. 244) to roll again. It receives the benefits of all magic used to enhance the first roll; the Sidereal can use additional [[Charms]] as well. If she succeeds, she gains one [[Willpower]].
