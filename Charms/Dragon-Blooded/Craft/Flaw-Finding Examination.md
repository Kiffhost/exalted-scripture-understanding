The Dragon-Blood’s careful scrutiny discerns any flaw that undermines the harmony of a project’s design. She undertakes either a basic or major repair project (Exalted, pp. 242-243) or a feat of demolition, making a (Perception + applicable Craft) roll before doing so. She multiplies the rate at which she works by her successes, and gains a temporary Craft or Athletics specialty that lasts until the task is completed, which she adds to her total Strength to determine what feats she may attempt. If she already has an applicable specialty, she converts the die it adds to a non-Charm success. If she also uses Stone-Carving Fingers to speed a repair project, her total speed is multiplied by (her Essence + rolled successes).
