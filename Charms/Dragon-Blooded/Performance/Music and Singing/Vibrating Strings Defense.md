The Dragon-Blooded makes no distinction between weapons and instruments, rebuking anyone gauche enough to interrupt her song. To use this Charm, she must be carrying or playing a musical instrument. She reflexively clashes an attack against her with a decisive attack, rolled with ([[Wits]] + [[Performance]]). This doesn’t count as her combat action. If successful, the Dragon-Blood doesn’t roll damage or reset [[Initiative]], but her attacker loses ([[Essence]] + attack roll threshold successes) [[Initiative]], which she doesn’t gain. The base [[Resolve]] of an enemy crashed by the gambit is set to 0 against the first [[Performance]]-based influence roll the Dragon-Blood makes against him before he recovers from crash. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by lowering an enemy’s [[Initiative]] from a value higher than the Exalt’s own to a value lower than hers.
