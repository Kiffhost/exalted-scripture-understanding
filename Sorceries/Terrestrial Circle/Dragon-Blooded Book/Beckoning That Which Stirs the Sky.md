As the sorcerer recites ancient prayers to deities long forgotten beneath the open sky, huge chitinous limbs emerge from above, weaving the wind and clouds to her will. Shaping the weather is an (Intelligence + Occult) roll that takes a few minutes to complete, with a difficulty based both on how drastic the change the sorcerer wishes to make is and how typical the desired weather is for her current climate and season. Creating a light rain in a temperate climate might only be difficulty 1, while strengthening a heavy rain to a thunderstorm or halting it completely might be difficulty 2-3. Summoning a thunderstorm from blue skies or diminishing a hurricane to a severe storm would be difficulty 5+. Likewise, any attempt to create rain might incur increased difficulty if attempted in a desert, as would calling a blizzard outside of the winter season. This spell can never create extreme natural disasters such as hurricanes, though it can diminish them to lesser weather. If the sorcerer succeeds, That Which Stirs the Sky weaves the desired weather in an area out to (Essence + threshold successes) miles from the point cast the spell. It lasts for (1 + threshold successes) hours before reverting to normal. Subsequent castings by any sorcerer cannot alter the weather within the spell’s range until its duration elapses. Characters within the weather can identify its unnatural origin with a (Perception + [Occult or Survival]) roll of difficulty 1-5, with subtler alterations being more difficult to detect. 

A sorcerer with this as her control spell may create sorcerous weather that follows her as she moves; this costs half her threshold successes, rounded up. 

# Distortion
(Goal Number: 10):
Distorting this spell reverses the alteration to the weather. It doesn’t merely revert back to its previous conditions, but is changed in the other direction — if the original sorcerer had calmed a thunderstorm, distortion would result in an even greater storm; if she’d summoned rain, distortion could result in intensely arid heat.
