*In her wrath, the Lunar shatters the limits of her own form.*
She rerolls 5s and 6s on a feat of strength until they cease to appear, and can attempt feats whose physical scale would be impossible given her size and leverage (Exalted, p. 230). 
A feat of demolition can damage or destroy a portion of a large object extending one range band beyond what she could normally accomplish. 
A feat of strength can lift objects she’d normally lack the leverage to, as though her grip’s leverage extended one range band beyond what she could normally lift. She could tear apart an iron portcullis with a feat that would normally punch a hole through it, or heft a felled redwood over her shoulder instead of lifting one end off the ground. 
With [[Essence]] 5, every five extra successes extends the feat’s scale by an additional range band, maximum long. With enough successes, the Lunar could crack a ship in half or lift a meteor from its crater, limited only by the feat’s [[Strength]] minimum. 
This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset with a successful difficulty 15+ feat of strength. 
## Protean 

In shapes with Legendary Size, this Charm’s [[Essence]] 5 effect extends a feat’s scale by one range band for every three extra successes.
