The oath of kinship can take many forms, but always involves a recitation of the names of those forming it, a statement of intent, and a vow of dedication, spoken as the participants’ animas flare. When the ritual is complete, the newly sworn companions know it deep in their bones. Hearths typically cannot have more than five members; the Storyteller may make an exception for games with more than five Dragon-Blooded PCs. A Dragon-Blood may join an existing Hearth by swearing loyalty in the presence of all its members. 
A Dragon-Blood can sense the presence of her Sworn Kin (p. 154), and some Dragon-Blooded Charms confer additional benefits when used with one’s Hearthmates. The death of a Hearthmate is felt as a sharp shock to the soul, sure and unmistakable. 
A Dragon-Blood may rescind her oath by informing every other member of her Sworn Kinship, whether singly or in a group, that the oath is no longer valid. “The Hearth is shattered” is the most common way to phrase it in the [[Realm]]. Her bonds to her former Hearth are severed, giving her an instinctive sense of finality, and leaving nothing where her Sworn Kin could once sense her presence. 
If a Dragon-Blooded deliberately betrays one of her Sworn Kin or her entire Hearth, her treachery shatters her [[Intimacy|tie]]. She loses all temporary [[Willpower]]. Unlike formal renunciations, the members of a traitor’s Hearth don’t automatically realize the bond has been broken, and can sense the traitor’s presence until the story’s end.
