Once, there was a maiden…
...who knew some things about a man. He didn’t
like that, but he kissed her anyway.
She told him everything in her heart:
she whispered truths to him, but he didn’t care;
she whispered hopes to him, but he didn’t care;
she whispered her prayers to him, but only heard
silence;
and she whispered her fear to him, but he didn’t
care.
He looked upon her inner self,
and the void met his eyes.
“To know the world is to fear it,” said he.
