*Flames seem to glow in the Immaculate’s eyes as she dances through a rapid kata, assuming a graceful, deadly battle stance.*
Against enemies with a lower Initiative, her attacks inflict onslaught penalties before the roll is made, penalizing the enemy’s Defense against them. When she parries a decisive attack, the Initiative her attacker loses (Exalted, p. 191) is doubled. 
## Special activation rules
When the Immaculate wins Join Battle, she may reflexively enter this Form.
