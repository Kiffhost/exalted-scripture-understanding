*The Infernal has carved a world from the substance of her own soul, an otherworldly realm made in her image.*

The Infernal creates an inner world within her soul. These are strange, uncanny places: a city of cyclopean basalt towers beneath a perpetually jet-black sky, lit only by a staring red eye. A ziggurat-tree of living ivory, swaying to the beat of the Infernal’s soul. A land of green and gold beyond the horizon, where the sun falls beneath the sea.

The Infernal may mentally enter her inner world while meditating, appearing at its centre or a point of similar significance. She can’t bring anything from the outside world into her inner world physically, nor can she take anything out of it. (For now.) She gains (Essence) additional motes per hour while within her inner world.

The Infernal’s player should work with the Storyteller to create a concept for the inner world. The Infernal can introduce new details or revise existing ones, rolling ({Charisma, Intelligence, or Wits} + Ability). This uses the rules for introducing facts, but the Infernal can use any Ability that fits and doesn’t need a Lore background. The Storyteller should set the difficulty of such rolls lower than for introducing facts about Creation.
