Making the Lesser Sign of the Mask, the Sidereal occludes her surroundings from unwanted surveillance. The Sidereal rolls (Manipulation + Stealth) to secure an area within medium range from outside observation. Characters outside this area suffer +1 target number on Perception rolls to observe it and must always roll to notice details about it and those within it, even if no roll would normally be required. Attempts to scry on the warded area, teleport into it, or otherwise use magic to observe or intrude upon it require an (Attribute + Ability) roll with the appropriate dice pool against the Sidereal’s successes. If successful, that effect functions normally. If he fails, the effect is negated and can’t be reused for the rest of this Charm’s duration. If the Sidereal renews this Charm at its duration’s end, she waives its Willpower cost and doesn’t need to roll, reusing her successes from before.
