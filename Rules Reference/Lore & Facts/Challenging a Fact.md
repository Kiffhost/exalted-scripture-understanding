Similar to the rules that allow the [[Introducing a Fact|introduction of a fact]], a character with a [[Lore]] rating of 3+, or [[Lore]] 1+ and a relevant [[Specialty]], has the potential to ([[Action#Reflexive|reflexively]]) notice any information that rings false. 

Any time the Storyteller introduces suspect information within notice of a character with an appropriate [[Lore]] rating, the Storyteller can call for a reflexive ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]) check to see if the character notices. A single success means that the character notices the falsehood, but not exactly why it is false. If the character is able to, on that same roll, succeed with enough successes to clear the difficulty as if she were [[introducing a fact]], the character can then also know how it is false.

A peasant farmer ([[Lore]] 1, with a specialty of sowing) could hear a deceitful spirit trying to mislead a Dynast into ruining his crop yield with bad information. </details>

Unlike [[introducing a fact]], the Storyteller decides exactly what the character is able to discern in this instance. Like [[introducing a fact]], the Storyteller may waive the need for a roll if they feel the character is overqualified for the knowledge in question.
