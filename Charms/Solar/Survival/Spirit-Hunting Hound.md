Though the Solar’s eyes may be blind to the spirit world, the eyes of her familiar can see into the realm of Essence. With this Charm, the Exalt invokes the familiar’s senses, feeding them with the forces that primed Creation. For one turn, the familiar can attempt to detect immaterial beings with a (Perception + Awareness) roll, against a difficulty of the target’s Essence or five, whichever is lower. If the Solar’s familiar detects the target, it continues to do so for the rest of the scene.
