Moving faster than her foe can follow, the Rat stylist closes the distance to strike him.
The stylist makes a decisive attack against an enemy at short range, moving into close range with him to strike. She adds (Essence) dice of damage, and an additional die for each 10 on the attack roll. If she attacks from concealment, she doesnâ€™t need to roll to roll Stealth again for moving.
This counts as her movement action for the round.

## Mastery
While in concealment, the stylist can attack enemies who are unaware of her at medium range.

## Terrestrial
The stylist must still roll Stealth, but ignores the penalty for using it in combat.
