The Solar’s spirit forms a bulwark against the powers of waste and chaos. This Charm allows the Solar to protect her followers from the deleterious effects of the middlemarches of the Wyld, diseases, and exposure for one hour. The Solar must lead her followers in meditation, prayer, hymns, or chants for the hour. As long as they follow the Solar’s example, the Storyteller should consider the masses to be mostly immune to such effects. For individual characters, the Storyteller should add (Solar’s Essence or three, whichever is greater) successes to rolls to resist such effects. The Solar can also psychically impart one of her Principles to those following her method, and such characters are likely to automatically adopt it without immediately realizing it. 

## Special activation rules

The Solar may pay six motes, one Willpower at the end of an hour to allow her followers to continue on with the method she has established even after she has gone. Doing so grants no more than two automatic successes against resisting disease or the elements, but provides the Charm’s full resistance against the Wyld or similar disfiguring hazards.
