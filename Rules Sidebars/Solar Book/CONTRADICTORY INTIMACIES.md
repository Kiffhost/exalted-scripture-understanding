Can a character have contradictory Intimacies? Can you love someone, and also fear them, or even hate them? Can you admire the Scarlet Empress and hate the Realm she’s built? Can you trust Panther (a former gladiator) as a friend, while distrusting gladiators and other men who live by violence? Absolutely! Characters frequently hold contradictory feelings close to their hearts—it’s part of the complexity of good drama. In the case of contradictory Intimacies and social influence, these conflicting Intimacies act upon a character’s Resolve just the same as in any other situation where influence is supported by one Intimacy and opposed by another.
