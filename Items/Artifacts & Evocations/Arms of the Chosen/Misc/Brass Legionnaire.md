*In the latter days of the First Age, Mizhra Starshaper forged five legions of brass soldiers for the Southern despot Her Blazing Majesty.*
Constructed without hearts, they policed districts and crushed rebellions with cold, clinical practicality. Knowing no personal loyalty, they obeyed anyone who spoke their command codes. When Her Blazing Majesty sought safety from the Usurpation behind the protection of her Brass Legionnaires, this proved her doom, as her own Dragon-Blooded lieutenants ordered the automatons to murder her as she slept.

After the Usurpation, the Brass Legions were disbanded and ordered destroyed, for fear that their maker had — like many artificers and sorcerers — left behind some cunning mechanism for revenge. But certain ambitious or thoughtful Dragon-Bloods quietly failed to follow through, keeping the remaining legionnaires in reserve for the wars to come. Most were cached in hidden places across the South, used only rarely and in secret.

Come the Contagion, the remaining legionnaires — immune to disease and fae glamour — proved indispensable in holding the line against the Fair Folk, but at great cost. Of the surviving Brass Legionnaires, some sought Dragon-Blooded officers who held their command codes, others persisted at their last assigned tasks as best they could, and the rest hid themselves away and shut down until maintenance and repairs could be made.

At most, a few hundred Brass Legionnaires remain intact and active throughout Creation. The Realm and Lookshy each have dozens cached away, while a handful of Threshold princes and sorcerers maintain tiny retinues of such soldiers. One is rumored to make its way as a mercenary, serving in battle in exchange for maintenance, repairs, and hints of officers who might give it proper instruction.

Brass Legionnaires are efficacious but mechanical soldiers. They follow instructions, fight in formation, and contain a library of tactical and strategic maneuvers meant for independence in the field. But their intellect — though the pinnacle of potential for non-sorcerous artifice — is limited, as is their memory. Most have forgotten more than any modern soldier ever learned, yet retain less than the average soldier knows. Moreover, they lack human initiative. Without orders, they default to seeking an officer who knows their command codes.

A handful of legionnaires break these limits due to meddling from [[Templates/sorcery]], spirit magic, or the Wyld. Possessing increased intelligence and free will, these are individuals rather than tools; for Merit purposes, treat them as two-dot [[Retainers]] rather than Artifacts. They can still be maintained and repaired normally, but their mental evolution may not endure incapacitating damage even if repaired, at the Storyteller’s discretion.

The earliest Brass Legionnaires are nigh-perfect replicas of human anatomy, distinguished only by metal skin and hematite eyes. Each successive series’ members appear cruder and more abstract, with the last wave featuring minimalist metal armatures. Despite these unexplained changes in semblance — did their creator go mad, grow obsessed with function over form, or simply lose interest? — the final models are as efficacious as the first. All carry mortal weapons; their armor is innate.

###### MERITS 
**Automaton**: Brass Legionnaires are immune to poison, disease, fatigue and fear (unless faced with magic such as the [[Dawn]] Caste anima power), and have no need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. 
**Brazen Legion**: Built and blessed for mass combat, battle groups of Brass Legionnaires have [[Might]] 2. 
**Command Codes**: A [[Brass Legionnaire]] automatically obeys orders from someone who knows its original unit’s command codes — elaborate, obscure Old Realm passphrases. Without codes, social influence and command actions suffer a −5 penalty. Any influence that directly contradicts orders issued via command codes is unacceptable to a [[Brass Legionnaire]]. 
**Glamour Resistance**: Brass Legionnaires are immune to Fair Folk powers that target [[Resolve]] or have the Psyche keyword. 
**Languages**: Typical Brass Legionnaires know Old Realm and two or three other languages. For newly reactivated legionnaires, these are often dead languages predating the Contagion. 
**Mechanical Mind**: Social influence cannot affect a Brass Legionnaire’s Major and Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], nor can it raise new Intimacies to Major or Defining. 
**Wyld Resistance**: Brass Legionnaires resist Wyld taint as per [[Chaos-[[Resistance]] Preparation]] (Exalted, p. 295).

## Maintenance and [[Repair]]

For every week of operation in battle or similarly strenuous conditions, a [[Brass Legionnaire]] requires a roll to perform maintenance. This is an ([[Intelligence]] + Craft{Artifacts}) roll at a difficulty of (3 + the legionnaire’s current wound penalty), and requires one scene to complete. On a failed roll, the legionnaire must either wait another day before a character can retry the maintenance roll, or take one unpreventable die of decisive lethal damage if it presses on without delay. 

Damage dealt to a [[Brass Legionnaire]] can be cleared from its health track with a repair project (Exalted, p. 242). Repairing a single level of damage is a major project. The difficulty of the [[Craft]] (Artifacts) roll and the time needed to complete repairs depends on the type of damage level being restored.

| Damage Level | Difficulty | [[Time]]       |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| -0           | 2          | One hour   |
| -1           | 3          | One day    |
| -2           | 4          | One day    |
| -4           | 5          | Three days |

If a legionnaire has been incapacitated, a superior project with goal number 30 is required to repair it.
