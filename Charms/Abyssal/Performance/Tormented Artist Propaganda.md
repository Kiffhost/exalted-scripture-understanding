*Symphonies and dramas authored by Death’s Lawgiver turn those who perform them into unwitting mouthpieces of the end.*
The Abyssal can sense whenever someone is about to perform a work composed by her and may reflexively use Morbid Fascination Style from afar. She gets a general impression of the performer, the audience, and the context, and may use Sinister Patron Applause if she wishes. She can use a Simple Charm, though any such Charms must make sense for the nature and context of the performance.
