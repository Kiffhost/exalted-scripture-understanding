*Death’s Lawgiver topples cenotaphs and monuments, casting them aside with a casual toss.*
When the Abyssal makes a Thrown attack with an improvised weapon, she can roll (Strength + Athletics) for the attack roll and ignores penalties for using objects unsuited to throwing. She can pay three motes to increase its range by one band, maximum long, and add one die of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage for each range band the projectile crosses.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can make a ranged feat of demolition by throwing an improvised weapon, gaining the benefits above. Instead of adding damage, each range band it crosses adds one die on the roll if she extends the feat’s range.
