Making the Lesser Sign of the Corpse, the Sidereal ushers that which has lingered too long in the world into nonexistence. The Sidereal rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Medicine]]) against the [[Resolve]] of an undead within medium range. Success inflicts (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice of aggravated decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. If the Sidereal has an applicable [[Intimacy]] of courage, recklessness, audacity, or anger, this increases to ([[Essence]] + [[Intimacy]]) dice. This doesn’t include or reset her [[Initiative]]. Zombies and other mindless undead are instead destroyed instantly, as are trivial undead. Alternatively, the Sidereal can use this Charm against a ghost if his corpse is present in the scene, rolling ([[Charisma]] + [[Medicine]]) against its [[Resolve]]. Success banishes it to a location of the Storyteller’s choice in the Underworld and makes him incapable of leaving the Underworld for (extra successes x10, minimum 1]) years, or permanently if it’s [[Essence]] 1 or trivial. Nontrivial ghosts whose [[Essence]] equals or exceeds the Sidereal’s may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist. 
## Reset
Once per scene. Using this Charm against mindless or trivial undead doesn’t require a reset.
