The wielder and the storm devilâ€™s [[Essence]] are as one, guiding the blade into a lightning-swift strike. This a withering attack with double 8s on the damage roll. On a successful hit, the storm gains +1 Intensity. The wielder gains no [[Initiative]] lost by her opponent (but still gains an [[Initiative]] Break bonus if she crashes him). [[Fulminating Edge Flash]] can only be used once per scene, unless reset by dropping an enemy with higher [[Initiative]] than the wielder to a lower [[Initiative]]. 

## Resonant

The wielder doubles 7s as well.
