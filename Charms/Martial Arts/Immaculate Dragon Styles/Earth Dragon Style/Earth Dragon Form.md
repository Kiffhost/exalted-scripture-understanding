Unmoving Mountain Stance The Immaculate moves through slow and deliberate katas as though the air were stone carved by her movements, crafting a perfect stance. She adds (Strength/2, rounded up) bonus dice on attack rolls of smash attacks or attacks against prone enemies. She adds (Strength) natural soak. 

## Special activation rules

When an enemy whose Initiative is lower than the Immaculateâ€™s hits her with an attack, she may reflexively enter this Form, gaining its soak bonus against withering attacks.
