*Deepening her enemies’ delirium, the direlash’s master traps them in a waking nightmare.*
## Resonant
Only characters resonant with this weapon can awaken this Evocation.
The wielder gains the following benefits:
 - Overwhelmed by delirium, cursed enemies must flurry just to take a single action on their turn.
They can take actions that can’t be flurried, like using Simple [[Charms]], but still suffer the penalties for flurrying.
 - Landing an attack against a cursed enemy with [[Night Hag’s Braid]] or a spell grants one curse point, maximum one per tick.
 - When the wielder takes a [[Shape Sorcery]] action, she gains an additional sorcerous mote for each cursed enemy within short range.
 - Cursed enemies count as having a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear to the wielder. If they already have such a [[Intimacy|Tie]], its intensity increases to Defining.
