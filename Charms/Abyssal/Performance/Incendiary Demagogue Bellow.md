*Death’s Lawgiver whips her audience into a frenzy with tales of wickedness and corruption, then aims them in the proper direction.*
The Abyssal rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + [[Performance]]) to inspire anger in an audience of minor characters (Exalted, p. 223) speaking against an organization or cause over the course of a few minutes.
If successful, her audience will act on their anger in a way that opposes the subject of the deathknight’s invective.
If the Abyssal rolls 3+ extra successes, she can focus her audience’s ire on a specific objective — e.g., a Guild merchant prince, rather than the Guild as a whole. Every three additional successes lets her choose an additional objective.
