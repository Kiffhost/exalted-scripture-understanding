The Dragon-Blood adopts a deceptive bearing that suggests illusory wealth or squalor, deceiving thieves and merchants alike. She can use this Charm to conceal her economic status in one of two following ways. She can take advantage of this deception with social influence as though it were a Minor Intimacy. Poverty: Those who see the Dragon-Blooded perceive her as utterly destitute, with Resources 0. If sheâ€™s wearing finery, exquisite jewels, artifact weapons, or anything else incompatible with total poverty, her Resources rating instead appears one dot lower than it actually is. Wealth: Those who see the Dragon-Blooded assume that her Resources rating is one dot higher than it actually is. If she has Resources 5, she appears wealthy beyond all dreams of avarice.
