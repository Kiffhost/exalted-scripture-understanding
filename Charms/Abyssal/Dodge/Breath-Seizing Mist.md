*The Abyssal flows into her victim’s lungs as a river of freezing mist, choking the life out of him from within.*
While using [[Tenebrous Cloud Dissolution]], the Abyssal pours herself into an enemy’s lungs. She rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]]) opposed by the ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) of a character within close range. In combat, this is a difficulty 5 gambit that’s unblockable and undodgeable. Trivial characters and sleeping characters don’t receive a roll to resist.
If successful, the victim begins to suffocate (Exalted, p. 232) and is unable to speak. He suffers a −3 penalty on all actions. The Abyssal can’t take other actions while suffocating him, but she can’t be targeted by attacks or similar physical actions unless they benefit from appropriate magic or a stunt. She waives Tenebrous Cloud Dissolution’s [[Initiative]] cost and can’t end that Charm voluntarily unless she leaves her host.
On each of the victim’s turns, he can attempt to expel the Abyssal with another ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll opposing her ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]] roll). This action can’t be flurried. If he fails, the Abyssal steals ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] from him.
While this Charm can affect enemies who don’t need to breathe, like zombies or characters using certain magic, it can’t affect enemies with no lungs or respiratory system at all, like most automatons.
