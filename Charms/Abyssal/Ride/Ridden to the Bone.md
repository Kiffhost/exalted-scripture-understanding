*The Abyssal wrings every ounce of speed she can from her mount’s hard-ridden flesh, urging it tirelessly onwards.*
The Abyssal adds an automatic success on all mounted movement rolls or rolls for her mount to maintain its balance, and her mount doesn’t accrue fatigue penalties from exertion (though preexisting penalties remain). Additionally, the deathknight can use [[Raiton’s Nimble Perch]] and [[Spider Pounce Technique]] to enhance her mount’s movement.
