The sorcerer’s dance moves the shape of matter as easily as the hearts of thinking beings. She can spend one Willpower to manipulate and transmute mundane matter through dance, rolling ({Charisma or Appearance} + Performance) to do so. Transformations comparable to a basic craft project or a Strength 3 feat of demolition require a miscellaneous action. Changes comparable
to a major project or Strength 5 feat may take up to a scene, at the Storyteller’s discretion. This does not require or grant craft points.
