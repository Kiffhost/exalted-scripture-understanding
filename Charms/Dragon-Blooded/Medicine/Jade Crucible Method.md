Essence flows through all living things, the ultimate source of vitality. Drawing on her understanding of this principle, the Dragon-Blood may heal others at the cost of her own life. After spending fifteen minutes meditating or performing medical treatment, she may roll (current temporary [[Willpower]]), gaining one mote per success and one [[Willpower]] for each 10. This can raise her above her [[Willpower]] rating. These motes and [[Willpower]] can only be spent on [[Medicine]] [[Charms]], and are lost if unspent by the end of the day. This Charm may only be used once per day, unless reset by succeeding on a [[Medicine]] roll to treat a character the Dragon-Blood has a Major or Defining positive Tie for.
