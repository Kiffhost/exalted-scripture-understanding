*Condensing the swirling corona around her into a single, blindingly bright line, the White Reaper suddenly strikes with preternatural accuracy.*
[[Bleeding Crescent Strike]] doubles up to ([[Strength]]) 9s on an attack roll. When attacking a battle group, she adds its [[Size]] to the number of dice that can be doubled, and may double 8s as well as 9s. While [[White Reaper Form]] is active, [[Bleeding Crescent Strike]] adds one die to the attack roll for each halo the martial artist has. However, at the end of the turn, all halos the martial artist has burn away into wisps of silver [[Essence]], consumed by the ferocity of the attack (except for any halos received as a result of making the attack). 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood can only use this Charm once per scene, unless reset by stocking three or more halos. 
## Mastery
Any dice added to the martial artistâ€™s attack roll from halos do not count as dice added by a Charm.
