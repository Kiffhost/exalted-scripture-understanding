*The Lunar undermines the confidence of mighty princes and esteemed elders by questioning their place in society.*
She makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + {Presence or Socialize}) instill roll against one character to convince him that he’s secretly distrusted and scorned by other members of a culture he belongs to. He treats any positive Ties toward members of that culture, or to the culture itself, as one step lower in intensity. Additionally, his suspicions and insecurity impose a −2 penalty on influence rolls and read intentions rolls he makes that target members of that culture. This lasts until another member of the culture convinces the target that he’s welcome in it, using the rules for overturning social influence (Exalted, p. 221). 
## Protean 

If the Lunar uses this Charm in the shape of a human who belongs to the culture in question, her target suffers −1 [[Resolve]] against the influence.
