This animal’s size makes it extraordinarily difficult for human-scale enemies to engage it in combat. It does not take [[Defense#Onslaught penalty|onslaught penalties]] from any attack made by a smaller opponent, although magically-inflicted [[Defense#Onslaught penalty|onslaught penalties]] still apply against it. 
[[Attack#withering|Withering attacks]] made by smaller enemies cannot drop it below 1 [[Initiative]] unless they have a post-[[soak]] damage of 10 dice (although attackers can still gain the full amount of [[Initiative]] damage dealt). 
[[Attack#decisive|Decisive attacks]] made by smaller enemies cannot deal more than (3 + attacker’s [[Strength]]) levels of damage to the terror with a single attack, not counting any levels of damage added by [[Charms]] or other magic.
