The Lunar raises a sacred place from the wilderness, consecrated to the divine beast that is her spirit’s shape. Those who enter are tested; those found worthy emerge blessed with bestial power. The Lunar spends five days laboringtocreateatestinggroundinademesneortheWyld: meditating,performingausterities,bargainingwithspirits, etchingoccultgeoglyphs,etc.It’simbuedwiththeEssence oftheLunar’sspiritshape;amortalwhosuccessfullycompletes its trial receives six dots of mutations reflecting that animal, chosen by the Lunar when she uses this Charm. LunarswithChimera-SoulExpression(p.XX)choosetwo sets of mutations per trial ground, reflecting both animals making up their spirit shape; successful participants receive whichever best fits their personality and their triumph’s nature. These mutations are hereditary, letting Lunars establish great beastfolk lineages. The Lunar doesn’t choose the trial’s nature; it emerges from her spirit shape’s nature and the Essence of the demesne or the Wyld. Her player should work with the Storyteller to determine what form the trial takes. It might be a challenge of physical, social, or mental prowess; a test of character or Intimacies; or an ordeal with no single solution. Whatever form it takes, failure carries significant consequences — not necessarily death, but maiming, curses, Derangements, and other afflictions are all possible. A character can only attempt a single such trial ever, pass or fail — she can’t subsequently benefit from other trial grounds, even those created by different Lunars. These factors limit the creation of beastfolk en masse. If the Lunar ends this Charm before the story she used it in ends, the testing ground loses its power. Once the story ends, the testing ground becomes permanent, no longer requiring committed motes and persisting past the Lunar’s death. However, testing grounds can be destroyed by building manses over their demesnes, or by permanently shaping the Wyld containing them into Creation with magic such as Wyld-Shaping Technique. (Harmony-With-Reality Technique won’t destroy testing grounds.) ALunarcan’thavemorethan(Intelligence+Willpower) permanent testing grounds. Testing grounds in territories she’s claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation (p. XX) don’t count toward this limit.
