Solar Circle Sorcery The final secrets of power are those that cost the most. Whenever Soulfarer’s wielder suffers decisive damage, each damaged health level grants her banked sorcerous motes equal to its wound level (−0 levels grant one sorcerous mote). These motes last until the end of the scene. In addition, this Evocation allows one Solar Circle spell to be drawn from Soulfarer, as per the resonant effect of Blood-Stained Secrets Initiation. Casting this spell costs an additional aggravated health level in addition to the usual cost.
