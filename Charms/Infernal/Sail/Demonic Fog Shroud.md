*The Infernal vomits up a sickly green mist that billows around her like a foul miasma.*

The Infernal shrouds herself in a cloud of toxic fog, extending out to close range from her. It inflicts a −2 penalty on vision-dependent actions, including attacks. It’s an inhaled poison with Damage 3i/round, Duration (Infernal’s Essence + 3) rounds, and a −2 penalty. The fog doesn’t impede the Infernal’s vision, and she’s immune to its poison. The same is true for allied demons.

If the Infernal uses this Charm in naval combat, the fog spreads to engulf her ship, inflicting its visibility penalty on rolls opposing her concealment maneuvers. The first time an enemy captain fails a Naval Maneuver roll against the Infernal, everyone aboard his ship is exposed to a variant poison with that has Damage 2L/hour, Duration (Infernal’s Essence + 3) hours, and a −2 penalty. The Storyteller makes a single roll representing the average dice pool of any characters not significant enough to warrant their own roll.

With Essence 2, the mist extends to short range.

If the Infernal knows [[Spiteful Sea Tincture]] (p. XX), the fog’s poison gains its benefit against characters the Infernal has negative Ties toward, as well as the benefit of any keys enhancing that Charm.
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she enters her [[Devil-Body]], extending its range by one band.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively at the beginning of naval combat.
## [[Keys]]
#### Brume-Wreathed Sinner Ship (Essence 2)
When the Infernal pilots a ship, the fog shrouds it even outside of naval combat, and this Charm’s duration lasts until she disembarks. It doesn’t affect her crew. With Essence 3, the poison inflicted in combat has a duration measured in minutes.
#### Omen-Weather Fogbank (Sail 5, Essence 2)
The fog extends out to medium range.
#### Venom-Vapor Brume (Sail 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal can cause the mist to appear from a liquid within medium range, rather than herself. Only a small amount of liquid is needed — a cup of water or puddle is sufficient.
