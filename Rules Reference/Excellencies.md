The Chosen enjoy a fundamental power called the Excellencies. When a Solar uses an Excellency, she channels pure Essence into her endeavors—the fundamental power of the sun quickens and strengthens her blows, sharpens her sight, or steadies her hands. Her own prowess is amplified directly. Excellencies can produce dramatically potent results, but are unrefined and inefficiently costly expressions of power. Still, often they are the only recourse available to a very young Exalt, and brute force is often sufficient to carry the day. Excellencies remain an important tool for even the most experienced and skilled Exalts. 

Note that excellencies are limited by the relevant [[Charms#Charm Style|charm dice limit]].
# Gaining Excellencies
Excellencies, and how they are gained, vary significantly between different types of Exalted.
## Solars
Solars automatically gain an [[Solar Excellency|Excellency]] for each **Caste** and **Favored Ability** in which they possess at least one dot, as well as any Ability for which they have learned at least one Charm. This costs no experience points during play and does not count against starting Charms at character creation.
## Dragon-Blooded
Unlike the Solar Exalted, the Dragon-Blooded don’t have generic Excellencies. Instead, each Ability has its own Excellency Charm. At character creation, a Dragon-Blood gains five Excellencies from any of her Aspect or Favored Abilities for free; the rest must be purchased normally.
## Lunars
Lunars automatically gain the [[Lunar Excellency|Excellency]] of each of their **Caste** and **Favored Attributes** they have at 3+, or for which they know at least one Charm. For each other Attribute, they must either have it rated at 5 or know two Charms to unlock its Excellency.
## Sidereals
Sidereals gain Excellencies for each **Caste** or **Favored Ability** they have at 1+ and each other Ability they know a Charm from. 
## Exigents
It varies. Generally some free some purchasable.
## Abyssal
An Abyssal automatically gains the [[Excellency]] of any of her **Caste** or **Favored Abilities** she has at least one dot in, as well as any other Abilities she knows at least one Charm from.
