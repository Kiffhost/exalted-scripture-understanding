*By examining a relic of the past, the Lawgiver can unlock the secret of how to use it.*
Using this Charm requires that the Solar touch an artifact whose purpose or use is unknown, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]) against a difficulty of the artifact’s rating. If successful, the Exalt gains a vision that reveals how to activate or employ the artifact. 
If the object or structure’s rating is N/A, the difficulty is 8-10, and rather than revealing exactly how the construct functions, the Solar only learns a fact about it which brings her closer to understanding it. 
This latter use can only be employed once per story.
