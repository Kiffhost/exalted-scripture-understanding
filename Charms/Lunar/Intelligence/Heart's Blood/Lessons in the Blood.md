The Lunar tastes her enlightened prey’s mystical wisdom, making his power her own. When she uses [[Memory-Drinking Meditation]], she may go into [[Experience Debt]] to instantly and permanently learn one spell or [[Martial Arts]] Charm her prey knew, up to ([[Essence]]) of her prey’s specialties, or up to ([[Essence]]) dots of thaumaturgical rituals he knew. She must meet all prerequisites of any such powers. As long as she retains her target’s memories, she may consult them as a tutor in other spells or rituals he knew. The first time the Lunar uses this Charm, she doesn’t incur [[Experience Debt]].
