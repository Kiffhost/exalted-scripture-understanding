The sun-blessed sage Thundering Heris discovered the depths of true grief when his journeys took him to the palace of Sirla Songbright and her Kingdom of the Thousand Perfect Things. Its people celebrated their Lunar queen’s false promises as a true future and her glittering glamour as great riches, while their minds rotted and bellies starved. Heris found his practical wisdom a poor match for the Lunar’s eloquent philosophy, and thus, he set upon a secret path to Hell. He returned on a moonless night with a black blade that shimmered green in the witchlight, scarring both the queen and her palace with its corrosive edge. The kingdom’s people found themselves both well-fed and trapped behind walls of scarred stone, now subjects of the King of the Thousand Broken Crowns.

The pitted surface and crude practicality of the Scar Upon Perfection have kept it from the treasure-halls of many would-be rulers of the Broken Crown valleys, but it finds a new hand whenever the wealthy become complacent and dare to decorate themselves in opulent excess. It was last seen in the hands of Sirla’s reincarnation, the revolutionary martyr Vitra Stonebreak, who never emerged from the caustic pit that was once the satrap of Ikaji’s palace.
## [[Evocations]] of [[Scar Upon Perfection]]
The wielder’s sword hand is coated with an acidic residue that lasts until washed away. With a touch, she can wipe away ink, smooth statuary, wilt flowers, and weaken chains. It counts as exceptional equipment on rolls to erase, ruin, or erode material: feats of demolition, Craft rolls to sculpt stone, Larceny rolls to corrode locks, etc. If her target is especially resilient or valuable, she converts the added die to a non-Charm success.

The wearer awakens [[Scar the Pillar]] for free upon attunement.
