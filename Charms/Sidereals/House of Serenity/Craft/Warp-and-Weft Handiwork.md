*The Sidereal draws inspiration from her understanding of fate and destiny, overcoming creative challenges through innovative design.*
The Sidereal adds a non-Charm success on a [[Craft]] roll. If it’s made at target number 4, she adds two successes instead. If she completes a project with that roll, the finished product has an unexpected but useful feature: an outfit might have easily concealed secret pockets, a sword might be durable enough to use for leverage in feats of strength, an artifact’s [[Evocations]] might incorporate an unexpected theme, etc. This Charm costs silver points on basic and major projects, gold points on superior projects, and white points on legendary projects.
