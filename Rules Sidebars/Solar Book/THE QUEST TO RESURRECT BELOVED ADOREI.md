After using the final Evocation, Beloved Adorei dies. Her voice can no longer be heard and her presence can no longer be felt. The daiklave can still be attuned and wielded, but her special attunement bonuses cease to work, and her Evocations can no longer be channeled. It is said that once her power has passed from the world, Beloved Adorei will return on the next solar eclipse. Yet the next may not happen for another hundred or thousand years, or even longer. In order to revive Beloved Adorei, the Solar must be an Artifact crafter or must otherwise seek the aid of one. The weaponsmith must study the weapon continually over a month to understand it well enough to revive it with a fine tempering. The rules for repairing an Artifact are on page 242. Each repair roll requires that the wielder recite a poem or haiku dedicated to Adorei, making a (Charisma + Performance) roll at difficulty 5 before the crafter rolls. The poem is then thrown into the tem- pering flames. Every success on the wielder’s roll serves to help awaken Adorei; extra successes on the roll reduce the crafter’s cost in gold points by an equal amount. The difficulty of the poetry reading drops by 1 on every consecutive roll. If the Solar doesn’t succeed at the roll, she must read another poem and make another roll before the crafter can roll to complete the project. Resurrecting Adorei requires as many poetry readings as the crafter needs craft rolls to complete the repair.
