Charging her arrow with Essence, the Exalt fires a heavy shot that rends the air as it passes onto her target, lighting the arrow on fire. If the arrow strikes flammable materials, a violent blaze instantly seeks to consume the struck object. This fire is natural, and may spread to surrounding objects or cause combustible materials to explode. When used in a decisive attack against a target, it adds one automatic success to the damage roll. If the attack does at least three health levels of damage, the target catches on fire, and must contend with (Solar’s Essence) lethal dice of damage every turn until he’s able to extinguish himself.
