The Solar’s sense of taste is so intense that she can analyze the emotions that went into preparing a meal or beverage. In a bit of overcooked meat, she might sense the cook’s turmoil; that his mind is not on his work. In a sip of soup salted with arsenic, she might sense the cool, murderous intent of one who is not her normal chef. This Charm acts as an automatically successful read intentions action to determine the emotional state of the one who prepared a meal or poured a drink. The Solar need only sample a single bite of a meal or take a single sip of a drink to gain this understanding.
