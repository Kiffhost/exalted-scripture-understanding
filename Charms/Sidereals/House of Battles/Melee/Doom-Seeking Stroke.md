The Sidereal sights along the strands of fate to find the flaw in her enemy’s guard. When the Sidereal makes an attack that benefits from aiming against an enemy at close range, she also adds the dice from aiming to a withering attack’s post-soak damage or a decisive damage roll as well as the attack roll.
