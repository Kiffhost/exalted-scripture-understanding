The Solar lunges at her target with a vicious left, enhanced by Falling Hammer Strike. On the next round, he attacks first, but his Defense doesnâ€™t refresh. She uses the Charm again, and snaps his head back with a shattering uppercut. For this attack, his Defense is still at -1. Because she used the Charm twice consecutively, he will be at -2 Defense on her next attack.
