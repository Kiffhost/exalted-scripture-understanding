A crimson haze fills her surroundings as the sorcerer issues a mandatory invitation to the Court of Coquelicot Veils, a numinous presence that costumes all in its penumbra with masks and cloaks of every shade of red. The spell enchants a single location out to a mile from the sorcerer. Anyone who enters or tarries in the area is clothed in an illusory costume of random design that disguises their appearance, voice, scent, and nature, including distinctive supernatural displays like anima banners. Attempts to identify others under this enchantment automatically fail unless supplemented by magic, and even then suffer a −(sorcerer’s Essence) penalty. Characters can spend two Willpower to tear off their illusory costume, reasserting their identity. This disguise also sloughs off if a target leaves the enchanted location. Control: The sorcerer can spend five motes to instantly don a random costume as if they’d cast the spell. It is not as flawless as the true spell; she rolls (Manipulation + Occult + Essence) to determine the difficulty to see through the illusion. Distortion (15): A sorcerer within the masquerade may warp the spell so that its disguises no longer conceal one of the following features: voice, scent, or nature.
