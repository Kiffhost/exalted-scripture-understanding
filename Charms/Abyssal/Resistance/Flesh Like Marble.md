*The Abyssal’s flesh fades bloodlessly pale as she suffuses her body with death’s Essence.*
The Abyssal rolls (Stamina + Resistance) with (higher of Essence or 3) automatic successes, which can’t be enhanced by other magic. While unarmored, she adds her successes to her soak and gains (Stamina) Hardness. She’s immune to environmental hazards with Damage 4 or less unless their nature makes physical resilience irrelevant.
