Stamina is a measure of vitality. In combat, having a high Stamina rating reduces the damage of withering attacks. Itâ€™s also used to fight off poison or disease, and more generally to endure the effects of anything that might weaken or assail the body, be it lengthy physical exertion, sleep deprivation, suffocation, exposure to the elements, or starvation.
