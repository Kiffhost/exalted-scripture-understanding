*With a dire syllable of command, the necromancer’s brand blooms on her victim’s ribcage, calling his skeleton to free itself from his flesh.*
The necromancer rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) against the [[Resolve]] of a target at up to medium range. If successful, the necromancer may command the target’s bones for (1 + threshold successes) rounds. Every round, the victim must take a miscellaneous action to roll ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) against a difficulty of the necromancer’s ([[Intelligence]]). On failure, the necromancer may select one of the following effects:
- The victim’s skeleton twists and dances within his flesh. The victim suffers three dice of withering damage as her body contorts, which doesn’t award [[Initiative]] to the necromancer. In [[Initiative]] Crash, the victim’s flesh tears, inflicting three dice of lethal damage instead, ignoring [[Hardness]].
- She can force the victim to fall prone, make him move one range band in any direction, force him to drop a weapon or object or inflict similar effects by seizing control of his skeleton at Storyteller’s discretion.
- The skeleton attempts to tear the victim apart. The necromancer makes a decisive attack through the skeleton that automatically hits, adding one die of damage for each remaining rounds of the spell’s duration. The necromancer resets to base [[Initiative]] afterward. This automatically ends the spell.
Alternatively, this spell may be cast on a corpse to permanently raise it as a bonesider (Exalted, p. 506) with a Defining Tie of obedience to the necromancer that cannot be altered.
## Control
Skeletons that kill their host tear themselves free of the victim to become bonesiders with a Defining Tie of obedience to the necromancer that cannot be altered. Bonesiders born from the spell are loyal to the necromancer; however this does not extend to those infected by the bonesider. Whenever the necromancer experiences intense emotion, such as anger or sadness, her own skeleton twists in odd ways, contorting her like a gruesome marionette.
## Distortion (8)
Distorting [[Bone Puppet Dance]] allows a contesting necromancer to take control of a skeleton affected by this spell (or give control back to the skeleton’s owner, ending the effect).
