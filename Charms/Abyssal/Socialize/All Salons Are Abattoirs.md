*Her heart poisoned by bitter hatred, the Abyssal exerts a magnetic allure over those who share in her malevolence.*
The Abyssal fixates on a negative Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] to an individual, gaining the following benefits:
 - When she encounters someone with a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the same character, she automatically senses this, though she doesn’t learn the Tie’s context or intensity.
 - She adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice on rolls to [[instill]] that [[Intimacy|Tie]], weaken positive Ties to its object, or leverage negative Ties toward him with a [[persuade]] roll. If she knows a character has a negative Tie with the same object, she may grant them this bonus while in their presence.
 - Against characters who share her [[Intimacy|Tie]], it supports the deathknight’s rolls to [[instill]] positive Ties towards herself or weaken negative Ties to her or the undead in general.
 - She can use [[Coiling Adder Spite]] with the [[Intimacy|Tie]] even if others know she possesses it, as long as the Tie’s object doesn’t.
With [[Essence]] 5, the Abyssal can use this Charm on negative Ties towards groups, places, and the like.
