Cunning Beast-Warrior Reflexes, Weapon-Snatching Coils The Lunar bedevils her foe with ever-shifting tactics, making use of every dirty trick in her arsenal.
The Lunar makes up to (highest combat Ability) gambits against a single enemy. These can include disarm, unhorse, and distract gambits, as well as appropriate custom gambits. She can’t include grapples unless she has Strength 5, and they can only be the last gambit in this sequence. She needn’t use the same Ability for all gambits, and may reflexively change weapons between gambits.
The Lunar doesn’t pay the Initiative cost for these gambits normally; instead, upon completing all of them, she pays (highest difficulty among successful gambits + number of successful gambits) Initiative. She can’t use this Charm if she doesn’t have enough Initiative to pay the full cost for all attacks hitting.
## Protean 
In animal shapes with a special ability or Merit that enhances an included gambit, the Lunar adds a non-Charm success on that gambit’s attack roll and (higher of Essence or 3) dice on the Initiative roll.
## Special activation rules
If the Lunar has Charms that let her make unique gambits, she can activate them reflexively with this Charm to add their gambits to the list of those she can make with Vexing Ape Antics, as long as she meets all necessary conditions and the gambits make sense in context. If a Charm offers multiple unique gambits, like Four Halo Golden Monkey Palm (p. 72), she need only use it once to add all those gambits to the list.
