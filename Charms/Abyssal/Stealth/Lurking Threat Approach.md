*The Abyssal sows terror from the shadows, her voice echoing from everywhere and nowhere.*
When the Abyssal makes a [[threaten]] roll from [[Rules Reference/Combat/Stealth|Concealment]], enemies who can’t perceive her suffer –2 [[Resolve]]. Doing so doesn’t break [[Rules Reference/Combat/Stealth|Concealment]]. If she uses this while [[Rules Reference/Combat/Stealth#Hold at Bay|holding an enemy at bay]] (Exalted, p. 204), she also increases the [[Willpower]] cost to resist by one.
