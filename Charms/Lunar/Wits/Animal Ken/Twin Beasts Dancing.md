The Lunar and her familiar deliver a deadly combination attack, striking down a foe in the same instant. She may pay one Willpower when she uses Guardian Fang Rebuke to use one of her own Clash Charms together with her familiar’s counterattack. Alternatively, she may pay one Willpower when using Throat-Ripping Guardian to use a Counterattack Charm together with the familiar’s clash. If she also enhances the clash with Unleashed Primal Fury, her Initiative doesn’t reset until after the counterattack. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar is in the shape of the same animal as her familiar, she may waive this Charm’s Willpower surcharge once per scene.
