*Stirring the currents of fate with her weapon’s tip, the Sidereal severs the paths of fate that lead to her being struck.*
An attack against the Sidereal’s [[Defense|Parry]] suffers +1 target number. She can block unblockable attacks. If she benefits from a full defense or hasn’t acted this round, she can use this Charm after the attack roll. With a [[Melee]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to inflict +2 target number. [[Uncountable damage]] is negated completely; she becomes immune to a recurring source of [[uncountable damage]] for the scene.
