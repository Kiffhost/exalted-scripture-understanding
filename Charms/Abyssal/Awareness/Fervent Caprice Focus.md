*Driven by obsession, the Abyssal discovers dark truths beyond mortal ken.*
The Abyssal can pay a one-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Morbid Inspiration Witness to heighten her obsession, letting her spend banked successes on the following effects. She must use them in a way that advances her creative goal or directly relates to it.
1 success: Add one mote toward the cost of a Craft, Linguistics, Medicine, Occult, or Performance Charm.
2 successes: Retroactively reveal a small but useful quirk in an object or undead she’s created: a zombie’s teeth have been capped with iron, a daiklave’s pommel houses a useful storage compartment, an antidote she’s brewed is highly flammable.
3 successes: Add (higher of Essence or 5) silver craft points or (Essence) gold points toward the cost of a Craft project or Craft Charm.
3 successes: Challenge or introduce a fact using one of the Abyssal’s Crafts or a specialty in Craft, Linguistics, Medicine, Occult, or Performance as a Lore background.
5 successes: Add one Willpower toward the cost of a Craft, Linguistics, Medicine, Occult, or Performance Charm.
5 successes: Waive the Willpower cost of resisting influence that opposes the Abyssal’s Principle from Morbid Inspiration Witness.
