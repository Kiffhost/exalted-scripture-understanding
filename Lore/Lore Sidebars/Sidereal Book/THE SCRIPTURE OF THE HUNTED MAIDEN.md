Once, there was a maiden…
...who was driven from her land.
Great black stags chased after her, and their eyes
shone blue.
Monsters scrambled after her through the bush,
though they found her not.
Stumbling on a log, she fell, and thought to surrender and end the torment of the hunt, but then
she stood, and stuck out her tongue at the dark
woods behind her.
“Love is smiling at your troubles,” she said.
