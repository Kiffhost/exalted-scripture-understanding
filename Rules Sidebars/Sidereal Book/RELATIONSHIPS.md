Sidereal Charms that refer to relationships are broad in scope, covering romance, friendship, family, business partnerships, rivalries, and more. [[The Solar Bond|Lunars’ bonds]] with their Solar, Abyssal, or Infernal mate always count, as do Dragon-Blooded’s [[Swearing the Oath|Sworn Kinship]]s and Liminals’ lifelines.
