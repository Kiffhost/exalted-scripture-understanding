A Solar who uses this Charm can invest her works with magic, causing them to endure forever. Candles spun by her hands burn forever, and a horse wearing shoes from her forge need never be shod again. This Charm only affects basic and major projects, and does not prevent created items from being destroyed by direct attack or overwhelming traumatic damage such as being caught in an explosion or buried under a mountain. In addition, such objects are indelibly marked by the Solar’s touch. If she claims to be the builder of a torch that never ceases burning, or a roof that never leaks, characters instinctively know it to be true without needing further proof. Such objects may also render the Exalt’s identity known to beings with particular [[Investigation]] or [[Occult]] magic. If she encounters her own works from a past life, the Lawgiver will automatically recognize them as her own.
