*Emerald Sunset scorches the sky, searing its wielder’s authority into that distant boundary between Hell and earth.*

The skies out to long range become choked with billowing smoke for the rest of the scene, shining through with rays of gold and emerald, banishing even supernatural darkness. This has the following effects:
- The wielder gains one Initiative at the start of each turn for each of the following that’s true: she’s successfully threatened a nontrivial enemy this scene; a demon is present; or she’s currently shaping a spell. She doesn’t gain this bonus while crashed.
- Enemies count as having a Minor Tie of fearful awe towards the wielder, and she may retry failed threaten rolls without needing to reset them.
- She counts as fulfilling an additional condition for [[First Arrow of the Prince - Baleful Sunset Glare]].
- She reduces the Initiative cost of [[Second Arrow of the Prince - Verdigris Grief Punishment]]’s gambits by one.
### Resonant
The wielder can use this Evocation reflexively when she wins Join Battle.
