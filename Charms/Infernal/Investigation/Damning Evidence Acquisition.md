*The Infernal knows just where to find your secret shames.*

On a successful case scene roll, the Infernal also learns the approximate location of someone or something that could provide information about the identity of the culprit or other details of the act. This doesn’t reveal what the source of information is, requiring the Infernal to find it herself.

Alternatively, the Infernal can use this Charm on a profile character roll. If successful, she also learns the location of a source of information about that character’s crimes or misdeeds. She can’t distinguish between the severity of crimes, but this defaults to a character’s most serious misdeed.
