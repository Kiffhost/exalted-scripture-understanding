*The Infernal’s cosmic might is too vast to be contained within herself, manifesting a pantheon of souls that emanate from within her Essence.*

The Infernal creates a Chrysalis Grotesque, within which the nascent demon takes form. After five days, it emerges. The Infernal’s player uses the Second Circle demon template (p. XX) for the demon’s base traits, with the following difference:
- It comes into being with Essence equal to the Infernal’s own, and loses any Charms from the template whose Essence minimums it no longer meets. Note that a spirit’s mote pool is ({Essence x 10} + 50).
- It has a total of (Essence + 3) Charms, including any Charms it retains from the template.
- While no Intimacy of loyalty toward the Infernal is imposed on it, it is an aspect of her very self, naturally inclined to serve her interests in its own way. Disloyalty is possible, but only in dramatic and extreme circumstances.
- If it’s slain, it will reform at the Infernal’s side. It can still be permanently destroyed with appropriate magic, but will be replaced by a new Second Circle demon, expressing the same aspect of the fetich in a different way, often causing the fetich’s personality to subtly change to match.
- It can’t be summoned or bound with sorcery.

These Second Circle demons gain an additional spirit Charm at the end of each story in which they play a significant role. When the Infernal increases her own Essence, each of her Second Circle demons gains both a dot of Essence and a spirit Charm. (Regaining Essence doesn’t automatically restore Charms from the template that they lost.) Their Essence can’t be raised above 7.

The Infernal can create up to seven Second Circle demons for her fetich. If she has [[Primordial Essence Ascension#Immortal Soul Multiplicity (Essence 4)|Immortal Soul Multiplicity]], she can also create Second Circle demons that emanate from her other Third Circle souls, up to seven each.

The first time the Infernal uses this Charm, its experience point cost is waived.
### Keys 
#### Infernal Aeon Emanation (Essence 3)
The Infernal adds +2 to the Essence of these Second Circle demons, including demons she’s already created. This also applies to Third Circle demons created with [[Primordial Essence Ascension|Primordial Essence Ascension.]] Their greater Essence doesn’t mean they’re superior to their creator — they draw from the untapped well of infinite potential within her, heralds of what she may one day become.
