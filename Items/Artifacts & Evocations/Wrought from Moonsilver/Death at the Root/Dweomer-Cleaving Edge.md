Death at the Root sunders the threads of sorcery. The Lunar waives Spell-Rending Talon’s (p. XX) cost when using it to enhance a chopping attack (Exalted, p. 585). It can also counter a spell being cast, stripping one sorcerous mote per two levels of damage dealt to the sorcerer. 

## Resonant

When using this Evocation to counter spells, each level of damage strips one sorcerous mote.
