When characters in-world take time or effort to attempt something, we abstract those efforts as an action.
# Extended
In situations where how long something takes is important. The player makes repeated [[Dice Rolls]], tracking progress (by counting the number of [[Dice Rolls#Successes|successes]] which **meet or exceed** the [[Dice Rolls#Difficulty|difficulty]] each roll) until a specific *goal number* or *terminus* is reached.
## Goal Number
If the total successes which **meet or exceed** the [[Dice Rolls#Difficulty|difficulty]] reach this number, the extended action is completed. 
## Terminus
Expressed as a number of rolls or *intervals*. If this many rolls have been made, and the *goal number* has not been reached, then the Extended roll automatically fails. The character is out of time.
## Interval
How much time elapses in-story between each roll.
# Opposed
When two characters attempt actions that can only result in one of them winning, each player makes a [[Dice Rolls|dice roll]] with no difficulty. The player with the most [[Dice Rolls#Successes|successes]] wins. In the case of a tie, the Storyteller awards victory to the player with the best stunt.
# Reflexive
These actions happen without requiring concentration, and at any time that is appropriate. They do not consume the one available [[Combat Action]] per turn.
# Combat
Characters may only make one [[Combat Action]] per turn in combat (as opposed to [[#Reflexive]] actions, which have no such limit).
