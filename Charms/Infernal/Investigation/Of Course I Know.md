*Through impossible leaps of logic that border on prescience, the Infernal bends fact and intuition to the fulfilment of her will.*

While using [[Infinite Facets Puzzle-Box Understanding]], the Infernal can spend contingency points to ask the Storyteller questions about the investigation at a cost of three points per question. The cost is reduced to one point if it’s relevant to a Defining Intimacy. If the Infernal has a relevant Intimacy, she can ask (Intimacy) additional questions. She can wait to decide whether to spend points on another question until after she receives an answer, but must ask all her questions in one go. This can reveal information that’s entirely beyond what the Infernal could deduce from available evidence as she reveals retroactive discoveries.

If the Infernal has [[Infinite Facets Puzzle-Box Understanding#Every Path Foreseen|Infinite Facets Puzzle-Box Understanding (Every Path Foreseen)]], she can ask a question about any ongoing investigation, even if she doesn’t have an Intimacy.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Mirror Sees All]] together with this Charm to reveal a preparation based on the information revealed by this Charm.
## Reset
Once per story.
