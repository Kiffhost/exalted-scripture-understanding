Harshly excoriating a rival, the Lunar turns his people against him. She makes a Manipulation- or Charismabased instill roll, ignoring multiple target penalties, to create a negative Tie toward a character or weaken positive Ties toward him by accusing him of violating a custom or more of a culture he belongs to. Targets who belong to the accused’s culture suffer a −2 Resolve penalty against this roll, and can’t bolster Resolve with Ties toward their shared culture or Principles that express solidarity, tribalism, or similar.
