*The Sidereal envisions the countless ways in which events could unfold like the blossoming of a flower, finding a path to the future she seeks and the consequences she dreads.*
After a scene spent meditating, the Sidereal states a goal she wishes to achieve. The Storyteller tells her player one way she could achieve it and the cost of doing so, ranging from minor consequences like “a few bumps and bruises” or “however much cash you have on hand” to those as dire as “the destruction of everything you hold dear” or “the deaths of millions.” If all players are willing to pay this cost, they achieve that goal without the need for any further rolls, resolving it briefly in a montage rather than playing it out in full. The options presented by this Charm are rarely the best ones, leaving characters free to try another approach in hopes of accomplishing their goal without having to pay the revealed price. If the Storyteller considers a task completely impossible, the Sidereal becomes aware of this impossibility and is refunded this Charm’s cost. If the Storyteller considers a task possible but so incredibly difficult that allowing a guaranteed success would be detrimental to the game’s narrative at any cost, then he can give the Sidereal’s player a way to solve the problem but not a guarantee of success, refunding this Charm’s cost.
