Blade in hand, the Exalt advances with Adalin’s swift, unthinking surety. While [[Razor Dancer Form]] is active, the wielder adds the higher of ([[Essence]] or 3) to her [[Initiative]] to determine when she acts during the round. She adds +1 [[Accuracy]] on attacks against enemies who haven’t acted this round, and adds ([[Essence]]) bonus dice to rushes against enemies who haven’t yet acted this round. She gains one [[Initiative]] on a successful rush. 

## Special activation rules

Whenever the wielder moves away from an ally toward whom she has a positive Major or Defining Tie and then successfully performs a rush action before the start of her next turn, she may reflexively activate [[Razor Dancer Form]]. 
## Terrestrial

The wielder doesn’t gain the form’s [[Accuracy]] bonus.
