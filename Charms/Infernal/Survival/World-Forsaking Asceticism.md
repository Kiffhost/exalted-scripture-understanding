*The Infernal is untroubled by worldly pleasures and sorrows, unmoved by opulent debauches and roaring flames alike.*

The Infernal doubles 9s and adds (Integrity or Survival) dice on a roll with any Ability to resist a natural environmental hazard. She can use it against supernatural environmental hazards that are similar to natural phenomena, like an aura of freezing cold. Even if she fails, the hazard’s damage is reduced by one die for each 10 on her roll, maximum (Essence).

The Infernal can also use this Charm on rolls against poisons and diseases that are natural perils of her environs, like poisonous plants or a mosquito-borne malaria.

If the Infernal has any Intimacies based on desire or enjoyment for worldly pleasures, this Charm’s cost is increased by one mote, or two motes for a Defining Intimacy.
## [[Keys]]
#### Final Desolation Survivor (Survival 5, Essence 3)
For a three-mote surcharge, any damage the Infernal suffers from the hazard is halved, rounded down. She can’t use this key if she has a Defining Intimacy based on desire or worldly pleasures.
