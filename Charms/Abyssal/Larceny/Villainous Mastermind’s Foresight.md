*The ever-thoughtful criminal, Death’s Lawgiver remains three steps ahead of rivals and investigators.*
After a scene spent making preparations, the deathknight rolls (Intelligence + Larceny), banking contingency points equal to her successes. She might prepare by casing a building, stealing useful information, forging credentials, bribing local law enforcement, laying groundwork for an alibi, or the like.
The Abyssal may spend contingency points on the following effects reflexively:
3 points: Waive Red-Handed Villain Artistry’s cost.
3 points: Retroactively reveal exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for a specific Larceny action (lockpicking, disguise, etc.) on the deathknight’s person.
3 points: Make a conceal evidence roll retroactively to conceal a piece of evidence. The Abyssal can use magic to enhance this roll as usual. The contingency point cost to use Inescapable Burden of Guilt or RedHanded Villain Artistry on the roll is reduced by two points each.
3 points: Waive the Willpower cost of a Charm that enhances disguise.
4 points: Waive Inescapable Burden of Guilt’s cost.
5 points: Gain +2 Guile or Resolve for one scene.
5 points: Reduce Insidious Shade Infiltration’s cost by five motes.
7 points: Retroactively erase a small piece of evidence, making it impossible to detect or uncover by any means.
The Abyssal must know any Charms enhanced with Villainous Mastermind’s Foresight.
