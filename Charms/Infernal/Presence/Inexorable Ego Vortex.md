*To look upon the Infernal is to be drawn in by the vastness of her existence, captured by the irresistible pull of her ego.*

Any Ties that the Infernal has toward herself or Intimacies that express how she sees herself become obvious to anyone who perceives her, exerting a palpable emotional weight. She can’t voluntarily weaken those Intimacies. The Infernal gains +1 Resolve against influence that opposes those Intimacies. She rerolls (Intimacy) dice that roll failures on influence rolls to instill complementary Intimacies or weaken opposed ones. For example, an Infernal with an Intimacy of pride would receive this bonus on rolls to instill Ties of respect or awe toward herself.

Any mundane surface or object that reflects the Infernal’s image is destroyed, or at least disrupted until it’s incapable of reflecting her. Mirrors shatter into twisted, blackened fragments, while placid waters boil. This also destroys other depictions of her that she encounters, like paintings or statues, unless the difficulty to destroy them with a feat of demolition exceeds (Essence + Charisma + Strength).
## [[Keys]]
#### Shattered Mirror Singularity
Disguise rolls to impersonate the Infernal and Craft rolls to create depictions of her suffer a penalty of (higher of Essence or 3). This applies throughout all of existence. If a character is already disguised as the Infernal when she uses [[Inexorable Ego Vortex]], he instead rolls that many dice, subtracting those successes from his disguise successes.
#### No Other Like Me (Presence 5, Essence 3)
This Charm’s effects become permanent. If she has [[#Shattered Mirror Singularity|Shattered Mirror Singularity]], its penalty subtracts successes instead of dice. The Infernal may spend (Essence/2, rounded up) Willpower to suppress this Charm’s effects for one scene.
