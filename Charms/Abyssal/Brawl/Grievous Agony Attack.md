*With cruel abandon and monstrous force, the Abyssal shatters her enemy’s bones.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a decisive damage roll, letting her forgo levels of damage to inflict one of the crippling effects below. She must deal at least one level of damage. Against grappled enemies, she can expend two rounds of grapple control in place of one level of damage.
Arm-Wrenching Twist (2 levels): The victim loses the use of one arm, dropping anything held in that hand and suffering a −3 penalty on actions that require both hands.
Foe-Blinding Jab (2 levels): The victim is blinded, suffering a −3 penalty on rolls that depend on vision.
Skull-Ringing Strike (2 levels): The victim is dazed and concussed, losing (Abyssal’s Strength) Initiative.
He suffers a −3 penalty to all mental and social rolls and a −1 penalty on physical rolls.
Leg-Hobbling Blow (3 levels): The victim falls prone as the Abyssal wounds his leg. He suffers a −3 penalty on movement actions and treats all terrain as difficult terrain.
Characters with Exalted Healing recover from these effects after a day’s rest. Mortals require medical treatment.
With Essence 5, the amount of damage that the Abyssal must forgo for each effect is reduced by one.
