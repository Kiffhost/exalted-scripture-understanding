*The Infernal confidently steps into the path of an attack, letting it hit her full on to prove her invincibility.*

The Infernal lets a decisive attack hit her, forgoing the chance to defend against it by any means except her unarmed Parry. She does not actively block the attack, instead “parrying” with her own invincible flesh. This uses her unarmed Parry, and lets her parry unblockable attacks. She can’t use it together with a clash attack.

If the attack hits the Infernal, she can pay four motes, one Willpower to subtract her total Parry from the attack’s damage dice, before it’s compared to her Hardness. If she doesn’t take any damage, she counts as having blocked the attack.

Alternatively, the Infernal can use this Charm to perfectly defend against falling damage a source of uncountable damage, rendering her immune to recurring sources for a scene.
## Reset
The Infernal can only use this Charm to penalize damage once per scene, unless reset by going a full round without taking any damage.
## [[Keys]]
#### Invincible Demon-Emperor Rampage (Resistance 5, Essence 5)
After using this Charm to penalize damage, the Infernal continues to apply the penalty to the effective damage of decisive attacks to determine if they beat her Hardness, but doesn’t actually subtract dice. She subtracts half that many dice, rounded up, from both the raw damage and the post-soak damage of withering attacks against her. She loses these benefits if she’s crashed or if she goes a round without making a decisive attack or spending 8+ motes on offensive magic.
