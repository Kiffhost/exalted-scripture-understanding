*The teeming throng of humanity isn’t so far removed from the panicked stampede or the rutting herd as they might like to think.*
The Lunar strips away civilization’s façade to unleash these primal passions. She makes an ([[Appearance]] + {Performance or Presence}) inspire roll with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes to create either fear or lust. Inspiring fear causes mass panic to break out among affected characters. The object of their terror can be the Lunar, but might be something else, depending on how she stunts. Affected characters flee the object of their terror in a panicked mob, stopping only when they reach extreme long range from it. Inspiring lust causes affected characters to engage other affected characters who consent in courtship rituals or physical [[intimacy]], ignoring etiquette and social decorum. Someone who can’t find a consenting partner instead engages in artistic or athletic displays to attract one. Unlike fear, lust won’t cause characters to desist from urgently pressing activities they’re already engaged in, such as combat — instead, they’ll wait until that activity concludes before engaging in their affections. Characters with [[Willpower]] 5+ may resist this influence like a normal inspire action. Those with less must enter a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and invoke a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] to resist.
