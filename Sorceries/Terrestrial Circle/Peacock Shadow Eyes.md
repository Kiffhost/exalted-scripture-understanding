The sorcerer’s eyes blaze with many-colored flames that enrapture and entrance. She rolls ([Intelligence or Manipulation] + Occult) against the Resolve of a character within medium range. Success induces a trance, imposing a −2 Resolve penalty on him. He can still act, but retains no memories of time spent in this trance, rationalizing any social influence used on him during this time as his own thoughts and emotions. Attacking or otherwise harming him shatters the trance. Blind or eyeless characters are immune to this spell. If a character’s suppressed memories would endanger a Major or Defining Intimacy — e.g., if the sorcerer revealed the existence of an imminent threat to such an Intimacyduringatrance—hemayspendtwoWillpower to resist, reclaiming his memories. Any social influence used on him during the trance remains in place. This spell is subtle but noticeable; onlookers with Resolve higher than the sorcerer’s roll — including her victim, if she fails — can roll (Perception + Occult) opposing it. Success lets them recognize she’s employed some form of supernatural power; otherwise, they dismiss it as a trick of the light. 

The irises of a sorcerer with this as her control spell are alive with luminous shifting colors. She treats her Appearance as one higher on influence rolls to inspire fascination with herself or any influence rolls against characters affected by this spell, but suffers a –2 penalty on disguise rolls. 

# Distortion
(Goal Number: 12)
If the trance is distorted in the scene this spell was used, the target experiences cryptic flashbacks of the suppressed scene. After (6 – Integrity) days, he can spend Willpower to resist, as above, in the absence of a threat to his Intimacies.
