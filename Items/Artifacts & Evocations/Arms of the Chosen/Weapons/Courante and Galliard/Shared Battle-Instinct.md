*Faced by danger, true companions move and act as one.*
When the wielder and her sword-sibling [[Join Battle]], each 10 on her sword-sibling’s roll converts a single failure on her own [[Join Battle]] roll to a success. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with orichalcum or moonsilver, as appropriate, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] by successfully defeating a significant enemy with her sword-sibling’s aid. 

## Resonant

If the wielder’s sword-sibling wins [[Join Battle]] against all enemies, then she may set her [[Initiative]] equal to his if it is higher.
