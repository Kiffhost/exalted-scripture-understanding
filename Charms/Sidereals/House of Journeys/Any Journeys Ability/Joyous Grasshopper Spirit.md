Like the shiftless grasshopper, the Sidereal eats while there is plenty, makes love when she wishes, sleeps as much as she pleases, and if she dies of it, dies happy. The Sidereal regains an additional Willpower from sleep. Once per day, when she indulges in sensual or hedonistic pleasures or neglects a responsibility or obligation to enjoy herself, she gains one Willpower. When the Sidereal upholds a Defining Intimacy, accomplishes a major character or story goal, or fulfills an auspicious prospect by indulging herself or neglecting her duties or obligations, she loses one Limit.
