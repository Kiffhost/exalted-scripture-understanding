*The Abyssal draws the force of her enemy’s blow into the infinite void of her [[Essence]], erasing its killing power.*
The Abyssal adds +2 to her armor’s [[Hardness]], if she’s wearing any, or the [[Hardness]] granted by Flesh like Marble. When determining if her [[Hardness]] prevents damage from a decisive attack, her attacker compares only his [[Initiative]] to her [[Hardness]], not any damage dice from other sources. If the damage roll doesn’t include his [[Initiative]] due to magic, he uses the lower of his damage dice or his actual [[Initiative]].
