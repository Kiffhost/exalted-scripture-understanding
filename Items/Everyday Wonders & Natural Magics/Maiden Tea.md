A common name for a wide variety of drugs used to render a woman infertile for roughly a month or a man infertile for periods varying from a day to a week depending on the specific brew, maiden tea is a favorite of concubines, courtesans, soldiers, travelers, adolescents and men and women who wish to avoid conception as a result of affairs. Taking three or more doses at once makes the user mildly ill (one level of bashing damage, and subtract one from all rolls until this heals). This level of dosage also induces miscarriage. Large overdoses (six or more doses) make the user violently ill (two levels of bashing damage, and increase the difficulty of all rolls by one until this heals) and renders the user permanently sterile. Cheaper versions of maiden tea are widely available and easy to prepare, but of varying efficacy. The most expensive and effective form of maiden tea requires extracts from venomous clam beds only found in the West, and is a lucrative import everywhere else in Creation.
