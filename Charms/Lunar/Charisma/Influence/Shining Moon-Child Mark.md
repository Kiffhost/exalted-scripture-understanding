The Lunar lays a sacred brand upon another, proclaiming his place in her heart to all who see it. She can use this Charm after visibly marking someone she has a Tie toward — e.g., applying war paint or a tattoo, placing a ceremonial diadem on his brow, inflicting a crippling injury, etc. All who see the mark recognize that it was left by a powerful supernatural force and are aware of the emotional context of the Lunar’s Tie toward the marked character. Anyone who sees the mark and has [[Resolve]] lower than the Lunar’s [[Charisma]] is treated as having a Minor Tie toward the marked character with an emotional context either identical to the Lunar’s or otherwise appropriate: shunning someone who’s provoked a monster’s wrath, placating a divinity’s trusted envoy, etc. This Charm ends if the Lunar loses her Tie or the mark is removed. This Charm’s cost is waived if the Lunar uses it on her Solar mate.
