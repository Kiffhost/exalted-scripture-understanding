*Stamping on the ground, the sorcerer wrenches open vaults and brings down a walled city’s gates.*

The sorcerer rolls (Intelligence + Occult) as a special feat of demolition against all doors, windows, gates, or similar portal within a single structure out to (higher of Essence or 3) range bands. This ignores the minimum Strength requirement for such feats. Portal that are warded or strengthened by magic or other extraordinary means, like a First Age lock, are immune to this.

This spell is as destructive as its name suggests. Wooden doors are blasted to flinders, while sturdier portals are blown off their hinges, battered and bent out of shape, or otherwise rendered inoperable. For those within close range of a demolished portal, it’s an environmental hazard with difficulty 3, Damage (Essence, maximum 5) L. Depending on the portal, the difficulty and damage may be higher. 

Alternatively, this spell can create an opening in a wall or other barrier that has none. The sorcerer rolls a feat as above to blast open a hole that’s just large enough for her to pass through, extending up to short range in length. Anyone within close range of the other side of the portal suffers a hazard as above. 
# Control
The sorcerer’s passions influence doors and other portals around her. Doors swing open exuberantly when she’s in good spirits, rattle in their frames when she’s angered, or lock themselves when she wishes to be alone. She can use this to her advantage, adding (Essence) dice on lockpicking rolls and feats of demolition against portals.
