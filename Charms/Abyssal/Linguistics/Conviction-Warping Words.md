*Against the deathknight’s words, all virtue is a weakness.*
This Abyssal makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + {[[Linguistics]], [[Performance]], [[Presence]], or [[Socialize]]}) [[persuade]] roll, either spoken or written. She can use one of her target’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that opposes her influence to justify her influence, urging a course of action that the [[Intimacy]] supports and then convincing her target to do the opposite. That [[Intimacy]] penalizes her target’s [[Resolve]] rather than increasing it. She could appeal to a general’s courage in convincing him to surrender, prey on belief in the Immaculate Philosophy to turn patricians against the [[Scarlet Dynasty]], or subvert a monk’s temperance to lead him into temptation.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can make an [[instill]] roll, as above. Her influence has the opposite effect of what her words suggest, weakening [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] instead of strengthening them or vice versa. She can still leverage opposing [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] as above.
This influence can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]] normally. [[Persuade]] rolls can still be overturned (Exalted, p. 221), but the [[Willpower]] cost for the victim increases to (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]). Instilled Intimacies can still be voluntarily strengthened or weakened normally, but the victim can’t distinguish them from his own feelings unless magic is used to break this Psyche effect.
