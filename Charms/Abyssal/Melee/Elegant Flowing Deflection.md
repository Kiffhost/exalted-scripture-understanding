*The Abyssal strikes aside her enemy’s blow with contemptuous disregard.*
The Abyssal ignores all penalties to her Parry other than those inflicted by surprise attacks. If she successfully blocks an attack, her attacker loses one Initiative.
While using Eye of the Tempest (p. XX), this Charm cost is reduced by one mote, and it adds +1 Parry.
