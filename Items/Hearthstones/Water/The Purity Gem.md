All water drawn from wells or rainwater cisterns within three miles of the stone tastes pure and sweet and never contains poisons or disease. Any toxins or diseases added to this water are instantly neutralized, and the water retains this property as long as it remains within the area affected by this gem. Even water in mugs or cookpots neutralizes all poisons and kills all diseases.
