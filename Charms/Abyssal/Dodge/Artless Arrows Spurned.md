*Disdaining her foes’ bumbling attempts to hurt her, the Abyssal redirects attacks to those more deserving.*
If the deathknight successfully dodges an attack, she may redirect it against an enemy within close range.
The attack and all effects enhancing it are rerolled, using the same dice pool, against the new target. Any [[Initiative]] a withering attack would grant the attacker goes to the stylist instead.
If the Abyssal is hit by the attack she used this Charm against, she waives this Charm’s cost the next time she uses it. She must do so before her next turn or lose this benefit.
