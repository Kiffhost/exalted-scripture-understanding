Once, there was a maiden…
…who was the living embodiment of everything
right in the world.
While she lived, no real harm could come to anyone. Oh, wounds, diseases, even death, sure. But
she stood between the world and anything worse.
“Except,” she said. “I’m going to die.” And no one
listened.
“I’m going to die tomorrow,” she said. And no one
heard.
Into the silence, she said: “There’s always an ending, after all.”
