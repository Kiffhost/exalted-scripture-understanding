*The Infernal’s hellfire crown flares as she bestows her favour on a subject, wreathing him in emerald flames that burn away all imperfections.*

The Infernal raises a willing mortal, Demon-Blood, or First Circle demon above the rabble of her other followers. That character must have a positive Major or Defining Tie to the Infernal and must bear a brand from [[Fealty-Acknowledging Audience]] or a similar Charm.

The Infernal chooses one of her Defining Intimacies that expresses or relates to a goal, and imparts a related Defining Intimacy to her vassal related to his role, duties, or motivation regarding that goal. For example, if she goes to war to claim the hand of someone she has a Defining Tie of love for, her vassal might gain a Defining Principle of “I will lead my lord’s forces to victory.” The Infernal’s vassal also gains the following benefits:
- He gains an anima banner (p. XX), identical to the Infernal’s save for its iconic display, which reflects his role in her service. (He doesn’t gain her anima powers). He gains one level of anima each time he spends a point of Willpower in furtherance of the Intimacy, whether to resist influence, add a success on a roll, or (for demons) paying the Willpower cost of Charms. (Demons don’t gain anima for spending motes.) - He gains +1 Resolve against influence that opposes that Intimacy. He can pay one anima to raise this to +3 against a single roll.
- When he makes a roll in furtherance of the goal his Intimacy relates to, he can spend up to (Intimacy) levels of anima to add that many dice.
- He can reflexively make his brand visible or cause it to fade to sight. Those who see the brand feel an instinctive fear that makes it clear the vassal serves a terrifying power.

If the vassal triggers his brand, the Infernal may choose to have it remain in place after the eruption, a warning against any repeat attempts. Alternatively, she may detonate the brand in an emerald bonfire, converting the brand’s dice of damage to automatic successes. This revokes this Charm’s benefit and refunds the experience points spent on the vassal.

This Charm’s experience point is also refunded if a vassal dies or ceases to be narratively relevant.

The Infernal may have up to (Essence x2) vassals at a time.
## [[Keys]]
#### Right Hand Ascension (Essence 5)
The Infernal can also grant her vassal (her Essence/2, rounded up) Eclipse Charms whose requirements she meets. Demon vassals can be granted spirit Charms that don’t have the Eclipse keyword. The vassal must spend anima instead of motes on the Charm’s cost, at a rate of one level of anima per (Intimacy) motes. (This applies even if he has a mote pool of his own.). Using this key changes this Charm’s duration to benefit, but the vassal doesn’t lose this Charm’s usual benefits if the Infernal ends her mote commitment, only the granted Charms.
