*Silent and light on her feet, the Immaculate moves unseen.*
She adds (Essence) dice on a Stealth roll, or (Essence) successes at Initiative 12+. With an appropriate stunt, such as throwing a flash bomb or handful of blinding powder, she may roll Stealth even if there’s no place to hide. 
In Air Aura, the Immaculate adds successes instead of dice as long as she isn’t crashed, and needs no stunt to enter concealment, vanishing into thin air.
