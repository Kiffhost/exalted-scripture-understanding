Unfaltering in her convictions, the Dragon-Blood embodies the unbreakable strength of earth. When her [[Resolve]] is beaten by influence that opposes one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], she lowers the cost to resist by (Essence/2, round up) [[Willpower]], minimum zero. If she enters a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], she must still call upon a valid [[Intimacy]] to use this Charm. This Charm may only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding the [[Intimacy]] this Charm was used to protect.
