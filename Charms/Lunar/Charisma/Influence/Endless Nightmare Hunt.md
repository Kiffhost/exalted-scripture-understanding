The Lunar’s gaze radiates predatory menace, piercing her prey’s heart with the terror of the hunt. She designates a character with a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward her (or her current shape). While she can see him, and for ([[Essence]]) hours thereafter, the [[Resolve]] penalty from that [[Intimacy|Tie]] is increased by −1, and he can’t voluntarily weaken it. The target doesn’t need to be aware of the Lunar. If the Lunar spends at least an hour observing her victim sleep, she can make an instill roll to strengthen his [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear. Success also afflicts him with nightmares, preventing him from regaining [[Willpower]] from sleep. This Charm’s victim may pay one [[Willpower]] to ignore its effects for one scene. Once he’s spent (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) total [[Willpower]] this way and fully eroded his [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear, the Charm ends and he becomes immune to it for the rest of the story.
