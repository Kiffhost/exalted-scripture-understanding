This long-handled white jade monstrosity stands taller than most men. Its massive symmetrical head is fashioned in the shape of two enormous fists — fingers adorned with rune-inscribed rings, wrists banded with jewel-encrusted bracelets where the two sides of the head meet the handle. Legend tells how the mighty Nameless Hero of the Divine Revolution fought against the Cavern That Devours Cities, using the Fist of Titans to rhythmically pound against the hills that rose to devour her. Rumored to have been forged by the nameless Exigent apprentice of the Elemental Dragon of Earth during the Divine Revolution, it existed only as a story in the modern age, until found by a Guild tomb raider and sold to the Realm as an Immaculate treasure for more silver than the local merchant prince’s entire caravan was worth. No one knows whether the stories are true — and Realm tellings cast the Nameless Hero as a Dragon-Blooded warrior instead — but there’s no denying the hammer’s dreadful power. It draws strength from the earth under its wielder’s feet and can turn that strength back upon its source with devastating results. Most of its Evocations will likely destroy mundane structures if used indoors.
