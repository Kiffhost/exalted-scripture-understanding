This Evocation must be used on the wielder’s turn, and may only be used once per round. The Exalt feeds her Essence into Spring Razor, causing beautiful pink-andcrimson flowers to begin to bud across the surface of its blade. After three activations (for a total commitment of 6m), these Essence-wrought buds come into full and deadly bloom, intensifying the poison that lives deep within the weapon’s Essence. While the flowers are in full bloom, the poison delivered by Howling Lotus Strike increases its damage and duration by one each. The flowers adorning Spring Razor can be destroyed with a specially-targeted disarm gambit (which does not remove the weapon from its wielder’s hand), ending the Evocation prematurely. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation may only be purchased by non-hideous (p. 162) characters with Dexterity 4+, Appearance 4+, or a specialty in an elegant fighting style applicable to Spring Razor.
