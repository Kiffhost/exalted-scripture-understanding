The Lawgiver can borrow against her own talent to bolster larcenous action. This Charm can be used to aid in protecting the Lawgiver’s disguise during a roll off, to pick a lock, to pickpocket, or to establish Stealth. It can also be used to enhance any social action contrived to swindle a target. For every one automatic success the Charm adds to the selected action, the Solar loses one Initiative from her next Join Battle result. The maximum number of successes a Solar can add between battles is half her Join Battle pool, rounded up. This debt is automatically cleared after completing a full night’s rest. Unshakable Rogue’s Spirit cannot be used in combat.
