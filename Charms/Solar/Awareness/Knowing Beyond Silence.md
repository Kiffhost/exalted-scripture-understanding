Even the least sounds fail to escape the Lawgiver’s notice. When attempting to seek out a hidden character with her [[Awareness]], all 1s rolled by her target act as 10s rolled by the Exalt, and all her target’s 2s act as 9s. These 9s are explicitly doubled by [[Sensory Acuity Prana]]. [[Knowing Beyond Silence]] can be activated after the hiding character’s dice roll. This Charm can be used to enhance a [[Join Battle]] roll against a character whom the Exalt is listening for but cannot see.
