Suffusing her body with illimitable beast-power, the Lunar grows unto a gigantic monster of myth. She may activate Towering Beast Form to grant her current shape Legendary Size instead of changing into a different form. Clothing and moonsilver artifacts rescale with her for this Charm’s duration; equipment incompatible with her increased size vanishes Elsewhere. Legendary Size grants the following benefits: 
- Smaller enemies’ attacks don’t inflict onslaught penalties. Magically inflicted onslaught penalties still apply. 
- She can’t be reduced below Initiative 1 by smaller characters’ withering attacks unless they have 10+ dice of post-soak damage. Such attacks still award the full amount of Initiative damage rolled. 
- She can’t take more than (attacker’s Strength + 3) levels of damage from decisive attacks made by smaller characters. Levels of damage added by magic don’t count against this limit. 
- She can’t be grappled by smaller enemies unless they use magic like Dragon Coil Technique (Exalted, p. 280), and they require such magic to resist her grapple control rolls. 
- She can’t be knocked back by smaller foes’ smash attacks, and is more difficult to knock back with magic (Exalted, p. 274). 
- She can engage Legendary Size enemies on equal footing, with neither applying the Merit’s benefits against the other. 
- Her form loses the Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size Merits if it has them. She also gains the following benefits in addition to Legendary Size: 
- Her natural attacks deal +3 raw withering damage and add +3 Overwhelming. 
- She gains +3 natural soak and Hardness 7. 
- She adds +5 to her shape’s effective Strength rating for determining what feats of strength she can attempt. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Legendary Size may learn this as a Stamina Charm.
