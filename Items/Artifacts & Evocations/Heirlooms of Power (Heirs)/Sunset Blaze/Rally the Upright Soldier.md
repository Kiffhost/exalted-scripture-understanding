*The sight of Sunset Blazeâ€™s flaming banner streaming across the battlefield brings renewed courage.*
Its wielder grants +2 [[Resolve]] to a character that can see [[Sunset Blaze]] (including herself ) or any number of allied battle groups against a fear-based influence roll, an influence roll that would cause them to refrain from hostilities or impair their ability to fight, or a Psyche effect.
Alternatively, this Evocation can add ([[Essence]]) dice on a rout check made by a battle group that can see [[Sunset Blaze]].
