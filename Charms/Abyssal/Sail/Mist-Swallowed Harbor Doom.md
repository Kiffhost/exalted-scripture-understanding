*Eerie mists herald the coming of Death’s Lawgiver, swallowing ports and cities in a shroud of accursed fog.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she sails into a port and disembarks, creating a cloud of mist that fills the entire port city or similar region. The mist is the same as that created by [[Mist-Veiled Galleon]], but it’s harder to disperse, requiring an Ambition 2 Celestial Circle working to do so. Otherwise, the mist lingers until the end of the story — and potentially weeks or months thereafter, at the Storyteller’s discretion.
Those within the mist-shrouded city suffer the effects of [[Dread Captain’s Command]], and the Abyssal treats the city as a ship claimed by that Charm for any applicable [[Sail]] [[Charms]], like [[Unhallowed Ghost Ship]]. The Tie imposed by it is Major for mortals unless their [[Willpower]] exceeds the Abyssal’s [[Essence]] and they have reason to act against the [[Intimacy]].
Any bureaucratic projects or similar tasks being carried out in the cursed city are delayed by the mist, halving the rate at which progress is made and inflicting one automatic botch on a roll for each such project per story.
## Reset 
Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) within the cursed city or aboard a ship claimed with [[Dread Captain’s Command]].
