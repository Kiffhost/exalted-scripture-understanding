*With a keen and shattering screech, the necromancer cracks the shell of the world to create a void that draws in air, sound, and hope.*
A pin-sized void opens at a point within medium range of the necromancer, drawing in all air and loose matter within medium range. At the start of each character’s turn, they must make a reflexive (Strength + Athletics) roll with a difficulty of (higher of necromancer’s Essence or 3) to avoid being dragged one range band towards it. Battle groups also suffer (Essence + 2) dice of Magnitude damage as poor unfortunates are dragged out of formation. The void is too small for most things to pass through, but liquid — especially shed blood — is greedily drawn in.
A vacuum forms within short range of the void, silencing all mundane sound and causing characters to suffocate (Exalted, p. 232). The necromancer is immune to the void’s pull but is still silenced and breathless.
## Control
The necromancer moves with unearthly quiet, inflicting a −2 penalty on rolls to detect her by hearing. Spirits of air and sky — and the ghosts of all who died by suffocation or drowning — count as having a Minor Tie of enmity toward her.
## Distortion (10)
The necromancer is no longer immune to the void’s pull. The difficulty to resist being drawn in is reduced by one, except for the necromancer — whatever exists beyond the void, it delights in treachery.
