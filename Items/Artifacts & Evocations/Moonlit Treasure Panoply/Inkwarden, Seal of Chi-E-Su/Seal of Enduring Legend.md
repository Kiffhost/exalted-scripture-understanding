Blessed by Inkwarden, a mortal smith’s work will endure for millennia after her end.
## Resonant
Only a character resonant with Inkwarden can awaken this Evocation.
Inkwarden’s bearer can pay a ten-mote surcharge when she uses [[Myth Made Real]] to permanently empower an object, rather than needing to maintain MasterpieceAcclaiming Mark indefinitely. It becomes indestructible, like an artifact, but still doesn’t gain artifact traits. The first character to attune to the blessed object waives the experience point cost of the first Evocation he awakens from it, even if he wasn’t its intended recipient.
The blessed object still counts against the limit on how many the bearer can have. She can still rescind her blessing if she wishes.
Neritoum, the All-Beast Avatar (Moonsilver Warstrider, [[Artifact]] §  - - - - -) The Exalted of the early First Age faced many challenges as they sought to bring all the world under their rule. Among the foremost of these were the behemoths that roamed Creation, colossal monstrosities and immortal god-beasts. Created by the Ancients, the sheer power and titanic size of many behemoths made their mere existence a threat to humanity.
A hero of the Divine Revolution, Seventeen Awaiting Terrors was chosen to lead the Exalted host’s first campaign against the behemoths. They set out on the hunt in the shapeshifting warstrider Neritoum, the All-Beast Avatar, created by Thunder’s Promise, their Circlemate.
Thunder’s Promise forged Neritoum from the many trophies of Terrors’ hunts: the scales of an ancient river dragon, the sinews of a giant cave bear, the colossal squid Vig’nagha’s many-colored gladius. She alloyed the warstrider’s moonsilver armor with these trophies, innovating techniques of sorcerous artifice inspired by Lunar shapeshifting. Neritoum’s flesh and metal are inextricable from each other; few can tell where one ends and the other begins.
With the All-Beast Avatar’s power, Seventeen Awaiting Terrors made the most dreaded of behemoths their prey — the Horizon Spider, the River That Walked, the Wolf of Calibration. In the Niobraran [[War]], the young Lunar Ravening Lamprey piloted it into battle against horrors of the ocean depths summoned by the Spoken. In the Usurpation, Daughter of First Frost hunted the Dragon-Blooded betrayers from Neritoum’s helm until it fell to the starmetal warstrider Saint of Dooms Foretold.
No artificer of the Second Age has yet succeeded in repairing the Neritoum’s ruin. Gadhaj Winter-Wheel sought to, raising a vast forge around the shattered warstrider, but the shahan-ya abandoned the project when conflicts over the Silver Pact’s priorities drove them to leave it. Neritoum still remains in what are now the ruins of Gadhaj’s workshop, accompanied by a teeming population of war refugees who’ve made their new home in the cyclopean forge’s shelter.
Attunement: 15m [[Soak]]: 15; [[Hardness]]: 10 Damage track: –0x5/–1x5/–2x10/–4x10 Speed bonus: +2 [[Hearthstone]] slot(s): 3 Era: The Hunt for the Seven Titans Backer: Josh Raveling [[Evocations]] of Neritoum Neritoum isn’t piloted using the control harness typical of most warstriders. Instead, tendrils of living flesh emerge from the many-hued shell that is Neritoum’s fuselage, affixing themselves to the pilot’s [[Essence]] meridians. The tendrils can merge with a Lunar’s protean flesh, waiving the need for warstrider specialties (Arms of the Chosen, p. 140-141).
When a Lunar shapeshifts into an animal form while piloting Neritoum, the warstrider’s moonsilver frame shifts to take on the animal’s shape. She waives the cost of such transformations. They use the normal rules for shapeshifting (Lunars, p. 131), but the Lunar can use the animal’s soak and [[Hardness]] if they’re better than the warstrider’s. She can also use animal dice pools, special abilities, and [[Merits]] that couldn’t normally be used through a warstrider, like an eagle’s flight.
The warstrider always remains at Legendary [[Size]], replacing the Tiny Creature and Minuscule [[Size]] [[Merits]].
(They still count as having those [[Merits]] for purposes of Protean [[Charms]]). She can enter shapes with Minuscule [[Size]] or Legendary [[Size]] without needing to use [[Emerald Grasshopper Form]] or [[Towering Beast Form]], paying only the usual four-mote cost for shapeshifting. However, she must still know the appropriate Charm.
[[Charms]] that let the Lunar manifest mutations, like [[Perfected Hybrid Interaction]], can also transform the warstrider. This allows such mutations to enhance the warstrider’s [[Strength]], [[Hardness]], soak, and damage track, and also enables mutations like [[Wings]] that wouldn’t normally be usable from the cockpit.
Non-Lunars: This warstrider’s listed [[Evocations]] are unsuitable to non-Lunars. Such characters might instead awaken [[Evocations]] that let them transform the warstrider into a variety of animal-like forms and expand on each of those forms’ unique strengths.
