Hidden in the shadows, Midnight Thorn finds the peace to grow and flourish. To use this Evocation, the wearer must have established Stealth behind plant-based concealment, and no enemy that’s aware of her can be within short range or closer. A layer of firm bark grows over Midnight Thorn’s surface, adding (Survival) soak and +2 Hardness.
