The Sidereal prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden at War, scattering letters of smoke and blood on the wind to entreat a divine champion. The Sidereal consecrates a battle to Heaven, offering up every fallen soldier and shattered sword as a sacrifice. Allied battle groups gain −1 target number on all rolls. Once the battle ends, the Sidereal rolls (Charisma + War) against a specific god or elemental with Essence up to the Sidereal’s own. She may add either the highest (Essence/2, rounded up) among supernatural characters who died in that battle or the highest Might among battle groups that lost dots of Size or faced other losses to the maximum Essence of spirit she can summon. The chosen spirit appears on the battlefield. If the Sidereal’s roll succeeds against his Resolve, she has two options. She may demand a single favor from him, which he’ll perform dutifully, forming a Defining Principle to completing that task which can’t be altered or weakened until its done. Most spirits consider this a fair exchange for the Sidereal’s offering; only if she demands a truly unreasonable favor will the spirit hold a grudge against her for asking. Alternatively, she can bind the spirit to her for a year and a day, imposing a Defining Tie of loyalty to her that can’t be altered or weakened during that time. Almost all spirits will consider this a grievous offense; one must be truly desperate for worship to gladly accept this as the price of the Sidereal’s offering. Historically, the most common form of reprisal for this has been efforts to bind Sidereal offenders into similar servitude, though it’s far from the only one.
