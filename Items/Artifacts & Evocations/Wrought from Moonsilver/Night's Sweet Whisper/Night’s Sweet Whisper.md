Allia the Songbird remained independent of the [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] throughout the Shogunate, shepherding and protecting the people of the small, isolated village in which she’d lived all her life rather than joining her fellow Lunars’ war against the usurpers. Queen Nabira of Many Hands forged [[Night’s Sweet Whisper]] from moonsilver and the bones of angyalka for the singer-shaman in hopes of earning her gratitude and admiration — but, while Nabira succeeded in that regard, Allia still refused to join the Pact. When the crusading armies of the Fair Folk fell upon Creation, Allia’s village was one of the few places spared from annihilation. For seven days and nights she played [[Night’s Sweet Whisper]] without ceasing, and such was her song’s beauty that no Wyld-born nightmare dared harm her or the land that birthed her. The fae passed by, but Allia was not content to simply protect her homeland. She departed to Creation’s edge, doing whatever she could to help stem the invasion. She fought alongside the [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]], but also aided Dragon-Blooded, Sidereals, and mortals taking up arms in defense of their homes. For all Allia’s efforts, the lives she saved were but a grain of sand, while those claimed by the Fair Folk were a great desert. Though she survived, her spirit could not withstand this despair, and she returned to her village to live out the rest of her life in seclusion. She left [[Night’s Sweet Whisper]] with Nabira’s apprentice, Snow Devil, for the queen had fallen to a raksha’s lash. Since then, [[Lore/Factions/Silver Pact|Silver Pact]] shamans and artists have continued Allia’s song — as well as the occasional outsider, for to keep [[Night’s Sweet Whisper]] solely in the Pact’s hands wouldn’t honor Allia’s independence.
