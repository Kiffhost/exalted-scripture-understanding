*The Sidereal compresses her anima into a wisp of Essence and swallows it, reducing it to a mere glow in the back of her throat.*
The Sidereal lowers her anima banner by one level for every two motes she commits. The swallowed anima can still shine through: when the Sidereal speaks, nontrivial characters can roll (Perception + Awareness) to detect it. The difficulty is (6 – levels of anima swallowed). If the Sidereal has swallowed 6+ levels of anima, no roll is necessary to notice when she speaks, and trivial characters can spot the anima’s radiance.
If the Sidereal releases her mote commitment, she regains the swallowed anima. While at bonfire anima, she can’t do so voluntarily.
If the Sidereal uses this Charm multiple times in the same scene, she waives the Willpower cost of uses past the first.
