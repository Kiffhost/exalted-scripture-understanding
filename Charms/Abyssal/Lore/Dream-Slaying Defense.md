*The Abyssal wraps herself in a shroud of deathly stasis, carving a path through chaos.*
The Abyssal and everything within short range of her are immune to the effects of [[Wyld]] exposure (p.
XX). Calcifying chaos forces the Wyld’s environs to obey Creation’s natural laws, preventing anomalous phenomena like inverted gravity or sudden changes to the landscape.
If the Abyssal renews this Charm at the end of its duration, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost.
