The character has an exceptionally refined pedigree. The blood of the Dragons runs strongly within her and her offspring. Her children are significantly more likely to Exalt as Dragon-Blooded than those of characters who lack this Merit. This is a prized commodity within the Realm and throughout Creation. Whenever she makes a bargain roll in which her bloodline is a factor, such as negotiating a Dynastic marriage contract or bartering with the noble families of Nechara, she adds an automatic success. Conversely, she gains +1 Resolve against bargains in that context. Neither of these count as a bonus from Charms.
