*The Abyssal finds it easy to cast off the burden of her identity — after all, that woman is dead.*
The Abyssal can enter and exit roles instantly with [[Wicked Stagecraft Expertise]].
With [[Essence]] 5, the Abyssal can invent a new role on the spot once per story. Rather than inventing new Intimacies, she must use Intimacies drawn from her own or those of her other roles.
