When [[Charms]] mention cultures, they refer not only to nations and civilizations, but also to the unique cultures of smaller groups — the members of a god’s cult, a city’s dockside workers, the adherents of a philosophical school, etc.
A culture’s customs are the traditions, taboos, mores, practices, and rituals that are common to most of its members. Customs needn’t be formalized, and often aren’t — some are so fundamental to the culture that its members take them for granted. Laws don’t count as customs, although they often overlap. Storytellers can invent customs for cultures they plan to introduce in their game or note certain behaviors as being customs as they come up in play. 
Additionally, players can introduce customs with [[Lore]] rolls (Exalted, p. 237). Savvy players can attempt to spread customs they can take advantage of with [[Charms]]. The difficulty of this depends on the details of the custom they’re trying to spread, the size of the culture, and their position within it. Convincing a Threshold village’s populace to shun strangers who speak High Realm might require time spent establishing a good reputation and multiple influence rolls with community leaders; convincing the entire populace of the Realm to adopt this custom would be impossible barring world-changing upheavals.
Projects (Exalted, p. 226) can be useful for handling the spread of customs if focusing on them in a smaller timescale would detract from gameplay.
