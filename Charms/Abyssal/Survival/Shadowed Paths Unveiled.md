*Tracing the passage of ghosts long past, the Abyssal finds safe routes through the most treacherous terrain.*
The Abyssal and up to ([[Essence]] x2) companions double the speed at which they travel, and can always travel at least ten miles a day no matter how harsh the terrain. She automatically succeeds at any [[Survival]] roll to find an oasis, shelter, or other landmark along the route.
