*The Infernal’s blade blazes with cosmic fire and hellish radiance, unleashing a wrathful power that slaughters armies and razes cities to ashes.*

The Infernal makes a decisive attack against all enemies within close range. It receives [[Green Sun Nimbus Flare]]’s benefits for free. It can be enhanced with that Charm’s [[Keys]], though the Infernal must pay any surcharges. She only needs to pay the surcharge once, no matter how many enemies she strikes.

The Infernal makes a single damage roll, adding two automatic successes for each enemy whose Hardness she overcomes. She divides her damage roll successes evenly among all hit targets, rounded up, to determine the damage they suffer. Battle groups instead suffer the total levels of damage rolled, plus the two additional levels.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has the [[Area Attack]] feature, this Charm’s range increases to short.
