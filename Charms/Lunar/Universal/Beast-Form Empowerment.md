*The Lunar’s hybrid form grows increasingly bestial, reflecting more of her spirit shape’s nature.*
She chooses an additional six dots of mutations reflecting her spirit shape to those she gains when using [[Hybrid Body Transformation]]. This Charm’s mutations are incompatible with those conferred by [[Chimera-Soul Expression]]. If the Lunar knows both, she must choose which one applies its mutations when she uses [[Hybrid Body Transformation]].
