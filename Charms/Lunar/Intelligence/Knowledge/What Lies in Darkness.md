*The Lunar frees herself from the conscious mind’s fetters, speaking secret truths she doesn’t yet know.*
While in an altered state of mind — induced through hallucinogens, fasting, meditation, vision questing in the Wyld, etc. — she rolls to [[Introducing a Fact|introduce a fact]] without requiring an appropriate [[Lore]] background, although the Storyteller must still deem the fact possible. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset when a fact thus introduced aids the Lunar, her Solar mate, or a character to whom she has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] in upholding a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]].
