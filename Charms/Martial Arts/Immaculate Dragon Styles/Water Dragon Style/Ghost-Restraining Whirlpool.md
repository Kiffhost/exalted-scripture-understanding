*Moving through a winding kata, the Immaculate stirs the seas of [[Essence]] that surround her, creating a maelstrom that inexorably draws in spirits.*
Spirits within medium range can’t move away from her without disengaging, nor can they use the Hurry Home Charm. The Immaculate gains all [[Initiative]] lost by spirits disengaging away from her. Additionally, at the end of each affected spirit’s turn, if he didn’t either move towards the Immaculate or end in close range to her, she steals two [[Initiative]] from him. 
Dematerialized spirits are even more susceptible to the whirlpool, treating its entire range as difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199). If she steals [[Initiative]] from them, they also suffer one die of bashing damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. In Water Aura, this Charm’s range extends to long. 
## Special activation rules
The Immaculate may use this Charm reflexively when she enters [[Water Dragon Form]].
