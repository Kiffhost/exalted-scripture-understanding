*The Abyssal cuts all sound from her victim, bleeding him in utter silence.*
If the Abyssal hits with a decisive attack, she silences him for up to (her Essence) rounds, paying two motes per round. He can’t speak or make sound, directly or indirectly, and can’t be detected with hearing-based rolls. Whether he screams, rings an alarm bell, or crashes through a window, he does so in utter silence.
If his actions have secondary consequences (e.g., setting an ongoing fire or startling an observer), those secondary consequences make sound normally.
If the target dies, no one notices his death until this Charm’s effect ends. He might stay standing upright, avoid bleeding, or slip silently into a nearby body of water.
