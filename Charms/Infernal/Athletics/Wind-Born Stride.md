*Few can run fast or far enough to escape the Infernal’s wrath.*

The Infernal adds a non-Charm die on rush actions opposed Athletics rolls in speed-based competitions. She ignores penalties due to strong winds on movement actions with any Ability.
## [[Keys]]
#### Unimpeded Perfection of Exertion
As long as the Infernal moves at full speed without stopping, she has perfect balance. She can run over solid structures that are normally too weak to support her, like a clothesline or rotted floorboards. Awareness rolls against her Stealth and rolls to track her suffer a −1 penalty from her light-footed tread.
#### Devil-Wind Surge (Athletics 3, Essence 3)
The Infernal adds an additional two non-Charm dice.
#### Horizons Stained Red (Athletics 5, Essence 5, [[#Devil-Wind Surge (Athletics 3, Essence 3)|Devil-Wind Surge]])
The Infernal adds an additional non-Charm success.
