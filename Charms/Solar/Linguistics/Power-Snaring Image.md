*When the Lawgiver is using [[Flawless Brush Discipline]], she may channel this power to perfectly copy any magic encrypted into the document she is copying, so long as she is capable of producing that magic herself.*
She does not need to pay the costs of any [[Charms]] her copy reproduces—those effects are reproduced automatically and perfectly. At [[Essence]] 5+, she may reproduce the written magic effects of the [[Charms]] of any being, even those who are not [[Solar Exalted]], so long as her traits meet or exceed the magic’s minimums.
