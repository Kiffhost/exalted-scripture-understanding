Once the Lawgivers were driven into the darkness beyond the edge of death. No longer. Upon being struck down, the Solar grasps the light of her divinity before it can flee and is drawn into her next incarnation without ever leaving her body. Instead she sheds her entire current set of Intimacies, Abilities and [[Charms]], inheriting the traits, [[Charms]] and Intimacies of one of her personas. This Charm is activated the moment her last health box is checked off: her anima blazes to iconic one last time, and then is vented back to dim. When it goes, roll ([[Stamina]]) dice with one automatic success, restoring an equal number of health levels. From that moment onward the Solar is a new person, and remembers her last incarnation as if it were a persona created by [[Heart-Eclipsing Shroud]]. This Charm can only be invoked once per story. Using it changes the Solar’s iconic anima manifestation permanently. This Charm’s anima display cannot be muted by any means. Stealth
