The Lunar unleashes the power gathered in her thews and tendons in a forceful surge that drives her ascent. She jumps two range bands directly up, which counts as her move action. At the leap’s apex, she may land on a horizontal surface, like a treetop, or grab onto a vertical surface, like a wall; the Storyteller may call for a (Strength + Athletics) roll. Otherwise, she falls normally, though she may mitigate this with effects like Wind-Dancing Method (p. XX). When the Lunar uses Spider Catches Sparrow, she may reflexively activate this Charm to attack an aerial enemy at medium range above her. 
## Protean 

In flight-capable shapes, this Charm lets the Lunar ascend two range bands. She may only do so once per scene, unless reset by successfully landing an attack against a nontrivial enemy at close range, or defending against a nontrivial enemy’s attack at close range.
