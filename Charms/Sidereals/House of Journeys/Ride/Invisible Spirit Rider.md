*The Sidereal rides along the spirit world’s secret paths.*
When the Sidereal’s mount dematerializes, she may do so along with it. This Charm ends if her mount rematerializes or if she dismounts. Spirits that are naturally material, like elementals and horses transformed with [[Fiend-Humbling Horsemanship]], may dematerialize while ridden by the Sidereal. This works like a Simple Charm, costing ([[Essence]] x10) motes and one [[Willpower]].
