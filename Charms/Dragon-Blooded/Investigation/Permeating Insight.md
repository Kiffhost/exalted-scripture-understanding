Deceit, lies, and obfuscation won’t avail fugitives from the Dragon-Blood’s justice. Their sins are pellucid as crystal in her eyes. She adds (Essence) non-Charm dice on a roll to profile a character (Exalted, p. 225). If she succeeds, she gains a temporary Investigation specialty in the profiled character. She retains the specialty indefinitely, but may only have one specialty granted by this Charm at a time.
