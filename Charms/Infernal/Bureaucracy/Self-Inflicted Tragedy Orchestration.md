*The Infernal need not sabotage her rivals — they’re perfectly capable of doing so themselves.*

The Infernal slows the interval of time needed for a group to complete a project or bureaucratic task by (Essence) steps: from days to weeks, weeks to months, months to seasons, or seasons to years. This doesn’t slow physical labour, instead inflicting severe delays that appear to be the fault of various group members. If this causes significant hardship for the group as a whole, its members gain a negative Minor Tie toward whomever they blame for it.

The Infernal need not interact directly with the project and doesn’t need to be specifically aware of it — she could target “any investigation of my criminal enterprise,” for example. She doesn’t learn if such a task is underway. If there isn’t one, the tragedy befalls the first such task to begin while this Charm is active.

Up to (Essence) different projects can be simultaneously delayed by stacking this Charm.
