Vines and ligneous tendrils spring from the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s anima as she lays hands upon a wounded ally. Ivy stitches shut bleeding wounds; lianas twist to set broken bones; bark grows over damaged limbs to reinforce their strength. The Dragon-Blood rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]), instantly healing levels of non-aggravated damage equal to her successes as plants replace damaged tissue. If the target suffers from any crippling injuries or effects that he could eventually heal or recover from naturally (including magically inflicted effects such as [[Joint-Wounding Attack]] or [[Crippling Pressure-Point Strike]]), the Dragon-Blood may split her successes between healing damage and alleviating these wounds, spending two successes for each point of crippling penalty she wishes to cancel. The player of the healed character may choose to be marked by this healing, accepting a scar that resembles wood more closely than flesh or strands of green interwoven with restored tissues.
