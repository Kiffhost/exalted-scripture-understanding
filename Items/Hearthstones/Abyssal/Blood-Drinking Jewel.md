*This crimson gem fuels its bearer’s power with blood.*
When mounted in an attuned artifact weapon’s hearthstone socket, if the Exalt has awakened any [[Evocations]] for that artifact or any other hearthstones socketed therein, this hearthstone gains a pool of five motes, usable only to activate those [[Evocations]]. This pool begins empty and can only be filled by dealing decisive lethal damage to non-trivial opponents with the socketed weapon, gaining one mote per level of damage.
