*The Infernal leaves behind not footprints, but branching fractal patterns that deceive the eye, sending her pursuers chasing after illusory leads.*

The Infernal can use a conceal tracks roll to leave behind a false trail, making it seem like she’s heading toward a location of her choice. A tracker who fails his opposed roll believes he’s succeeded, but only finds the false trail. A successful roll reveals both trails, but not which is the true one.

This Charm conceals more than just tracks. If there’s any physical evidence that could somehow provide information about her identity or appearance, rolls to notice or appreciate it suffer a −3 penalty, and the Storyteller may require difficulty 1 rolls to notice obvious details. The same penalty applies to magic that could do so, like certain Investigation Charms.
## [[Keys]]
#### Branching Falsehood Fractal (+2m)
For a two-mote surcharge, the Infernal’s footsteps branch out to twist those of up to (Essence + 5) other characters, letting them use half her total successes instead of their own roll, if it’s higher. With Survival 5, Essence 3, they can use the full amount of her successes.
#### Heart-Mirror Labyrinth
The Infernal can leave a false trail based on her trackers’ subjective beliefs or opinions, like “where they expect me to go,” “where they think I live,” “the place that would make fear the most.”
