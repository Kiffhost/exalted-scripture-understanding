The wearer may walk away from an avalanche with nothing worse than rumpled robes…at least, for a time. The wearer may spend six motes and one Willpower to invoke Tomorrow’s Troubles Defense against a Crippling effect or an instance of uncountable damage, negating the harm. In exchange, she becomes the subject of a baleful prophecy of the Storyteller’s choice, bringing a certain type of misfortune to herself, such as bankruptcy, illness, defeat, or scandal. She suffers +1 target number to rolls that could result in that misfortune for the rest of the story. If this Charm is used towards the end of the current story, the effect may carry over to the next instead at the Storyteller’s discretion. Repurchase at Essence 3+ allows the wearer to learn how to negate a Shaping effect instead of a Crippling one. 

## Dissonant

Wearers dissonant with starmetal suffer +2 target number to avoid their misfortune instead.
