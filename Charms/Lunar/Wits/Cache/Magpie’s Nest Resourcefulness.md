The Lunar has a knack for anticipating exactly what’s neededinanyconceivablesituation.Revealingthatshe’s had a mundane item that could be concealed upon her person all along, she makes a ([[Wits]] + Ability) roll at difficulty (its [[Resources]] rating), using an Ability reflecting how she procured the item: [[Bureaucracy]] if bought while passing through a market, [[Craft]] if built over downtime, [[Larceny]] if stolen, etc. If successful, she produces the item, which counts as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580). On failure, she still produces the item, but it’s deficient in some Storyteller-determined way: imposing a −1 penalty, falling apart at end of scene, etc. If the Lunar has a relevant [[Craft]], she gains crafting points for succeeding as though she’d completed a basic project (Exalted, p. 240). This Charm can only be used once per scene. EX3 290
