*Bringing the wind to heel with a forceful whistle, the sorcerer gives it purpose and form as a great wolfhound.* 

The sorcerer summons a hound of the five winds, a wolfhound large enough for a human to ride. It obeys her faithfully for the spell’s duration before dissolving back into wind. If summoned into battle, it rolls [[Join Battle]] immediately. This spell ends if the sorcerer casts it again.

# Control
The sorcerer may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge and cast this as a ritual spell, singing paeans to the five winds of Creation and the fettered Wolf-Wind. Doing so summons (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) hounds. 
# Distortion 
(Goal Number: 10)
The hound partially dissolves back into wind, gaining +1 [[Defense|Evasion]] but suffering a –4 penalty on all physical actions and damage rolls. This can’t reduce a withering damage roll below its Overwhelming or a decisive damage roll below its base [[Initiative]].
