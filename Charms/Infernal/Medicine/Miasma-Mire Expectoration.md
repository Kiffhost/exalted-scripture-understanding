*The Infernal exhales a sickly green miasma, a haze made up of countless demonic spores eager to take root in living flesh.*

The Infernal exhales a miasma that extends out to medium range, remaining there for one scene. It carries a mundane disease chosen by the Infernal from those she plays host to with [[Exquisite Contagion Connoisseur]], exposing characters in the miasma to that disease both when the Infernal uses this Charm and at the start of each of her turns. The miasma also inflicts a −1 penalty on vision-dependent actions, including attacks.
## [[Keys]]
#### Devil-Plague Corruption (Essence 4) (+5m)
The Infernal can pay a five-mote surcharge to spread a supernatural disease through the miasma. Doing so reduces the miasma’s range to short and requires the Infernal to commit this Charm’s mote cost for the scene. If she has [[Slavering Horror Maw]] (p. XX), she can use any supernatural disease for which she’s purchased the [[Slavering Horror Maw#Devil-Fever Ravages (Brawl 5, Essence 2, Pestilential Hunger Bite (Brawl 3) Pestilential Hunger Bite ) (+1wp)|Devil-Fever Ravages]] key, in addition to those she hosts.
