*Crack-Mending Technique depicts a Lawgiver whose talent and touch is such that she can repair even impossibly destroyed things.*
This Charm can’t restore things that were completely unmade (for example, by powerful [[sorcery]], digestion in a behemoth’s gullet, or immersion in molten rock) but it can remake extremely damaged things like shattered crystal, burnt paper, splintered wood and twisted metal. As the Solar works with the remains of a broken or destroyed object, she may slowly piece it together with word, touch, and [[Essence]] over the course of (10 - [[Essence]]) hours. If used while under the effect of [[Craftsman Needs No Tools]], this time is reduced to minutes or seconds, and eliminates both the need for tools and in many cases for materials. This Charm can restore magical objects but not metaphorical concepts: it cannot mend a broken heart, nor can it put the magic back into a First Age construct whose magic has fled or faded away. This Charm may lower the difficulty of repairing Artifacts that are fragmented or shattered, while also making such a repair possible, but otherwise does not remove the material requirements or affect the goal number.
