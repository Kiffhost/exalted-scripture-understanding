After successfully dodging an attack, the Exalt may activate this Charm to remember a single Charm used in the attack. She feels its spiritual form and pressure as a physical thing and understands how to dodge it. For the remainder of the scene, she perfectly evades the effects of that Charm. [[Hundred Shadow Ways]] cannot be used against the Excellency Charm of any Ability, nor can it be used against [[sorcery]] or [[Evocations]]. Furthermore, if the Exalt falls into [[Initiative]] Crash, this Charm ends.

### Sidebar
Say you’ve used [[Hundred Shadow Ways|this Charm]] to lock out [[Hungry Tiger Technique]]. An attack enhanced solely by [[Hungry Tiger Technique]] automatically fails. Now the opponent throws a combination of [[Hungry Tiger Technique]] and Fire and Stones Strike—the attack still occurs, but [[Hundred Shadow Ways]] automatically removes the benefit of [[Hungry Tiger Technique]] from the attack. This Charm can be used to “learn” as many [[Charms]] as the Exalt’s mote pool can afford.
