# TLDR
When a character is first exposed to a vector of disease, they roll (Stamina + Resistance) against that disease’s virulence. On a successful roll, they avoid succumbing to the sickness. On a failed roll, they contract the disease at the level of a minor symptom. After each interval of the disease has passed, the character makes another (Stamina + Resistance) roll, this time against the disease’s morbidity. On a failed roll, the symptoms intensify by one step; on a success, they grow one step less intense (or are overcome entirely, if they were already at the minor symptom level).

In a world of capricious gods, restless dead, and nameless horrors baying at the edges of Creation, common disease still numbers among the greatest enemies of mankind. Cholera breeds in unclean water; lepers wrap their misshapen bodies in rags as their living flesh rots; plagues wipe entire villages out of existence. The gift of Exaltation makes the Chosen immune to the worst perils of disease—they suffer no risk of death from any sickness, save perhaps from extremely potent magical diseases.

However, this does not mean they have nothing to fear. In Exalted, a disease is treated as a debilitating status effect that progresses in severity over time. Each disease has three main statistics: [[#Virulence]], [[#Morbidity]], and [[#Interval]].
### Virulence
The difficulty which characters must overcome to avoid contracting the disease. 
### Morbidity
The difficulty which characters must overcome to keep their symptoms from worsening. 
### Interval
The duration of time after which a character must roll when to see if the disease’s effects intensify. 
## Progression
The progress of a sickness is analogous to the increasing intensity of Intimacies—a disease first begins as a [[#minor symptom]], then progresses to a [[#major symptom]], and finally to a [[#defining symptom]]. While the actual symptoms of each disease vary, Exalted treats them as things to be roleplayed by the player of the diseased character, rather than attempting a realistic model of real world sickness. 

Not all diseases are capable of reaching all stages of this progression, with their maximum level of intensity noted in their description. In addition, some exotic or supernatural diseases may have additional effects based on symptom intensity. 

Aside from these, the following three stages are the same for all diseases: 
### Minor Symptom
While the character has felt the onset of the disease’s symptoms, they have not yet begun to impair his ability to function. It is sufficient for his player to simply play out the uncomfortable effects of the disease in game, with **no mechanical penalties**. If the Storyteller feels that the player has not done so, he may deduct a point of [[Willpower]] from the character up to once per session, to represent a general malaise. 
### Major Symptom
The disease has progressed to the point of a serious problem. **Once per session, the Storyteller may declare any action that the diseased character takes to be an automatic botch**, describing how their symptoms flare up to impede their action. Alternatively, he may instead subtract a point of Willpower from the diseased character, as with minor symptoms—this option is primarily for sessions when an opportune moment for a botch never comes up, or if the Storyteller forgets until the end of the session. 
### Defining Symptom
The disease defines the character’s lifestyle, interfering in almost everything he does. Now, **the Storyteller may declare an automatic botch once per scene**, rather than once per session, a penalty that may render the character largely helpless in many situations.

Note that is purely at the Storyteller’s option—if it doesn’t make sense for a botch to occur, there’s no need to force one in ham-handedly. As with major symptoms, the Storyteller may substitute draining a point of Willpower for a botch, but should be judicious in doing so—grinding a character down to zero Willpower over the course of a session isn’t going to make the game very fun. Try to limit Willpower drain from disease to once or twice per session, and stick to botches most of the time. </details>
### Death
While the **Exalted and other supernatural beings are immune to death from disease**, mortals do not have such good fortune. Once a mortal’s ailment has progressed to the level of a defining symptom, the next step is death by disease, as narrated by the Storyteller.
