When the behemoth Entalion broke free of its imprisonment in Zen-Mu and escaped into Creation, it was greeted by the sorcerer-swordsman Kindu Slays-the-Cloud. The grotesque beast of coiling flesh fell easily to the Dawn Caste’s blade — but that was not Entalion, only his host.
Formless and immaterial, Entalion hid itself in Kindu’s daiklave, biding its time until it could find another host.
Its opportunity came when the Solar returned home to his family. As his husband, Melodious Flame, helped relieve Kindu of his arms, Entalion crept into the mortal’s mind. It rooted there, feeding on Melodious Flame’s memories until nothing of him remained.
When Kindu learned what had happened, he fell into a rage beyond all measure. With dread sorceries of world-shaking power, he ripped Entalion from Melodious Flame’s mind and nailed it to the sky. But for all his power, he could not restore what had been taken from his beloved. Desperate, he summoned the demon-smith Ligier, who is the green sun of Hell itself, and demanded a way to return Melodious Flame’s memories.
Ever eager to demonstrate his prowess, Ligier set to work forging a moonsilver blade, harnessing the metal’s affinity for insight and madness. But the demon warned Kindu of his craft’s cost: the only way for the Solar to win back his past was to sacrifice the future, tempering the daiklave in his children’s blood. Already stricken with grief, Kindu could not bear another loss. Instead, he ensorcelled three cows, transforming them into simulacra of his children and offering them to Ligier. If the demon-smith noticed this deception, he spoke not of it.
As Kindu lay the blade against Melodious Flame’s brow, his beloved finally stirred from his insensate stupor. He thought nothing of Ligier’s warning, certain that he’d outwitted the demon with his sorcerous deception.
But as time went on, Melodious Flame grew more and more troubled by his memories. To be sure, they were memories of the life he’d lived, seen through his eyes...
but they were not his.
When at last Melodious Flame revealed this to Kindu, the Solar realized what he had done. Fond Remembrance did not restore memories — it created them. He had damned Melodious Flame to an existence as a hollow parody of himself, cast in the mold of Kindu’s perception of him. Their story ended in tragedy, and Fond Remembrance was cast into the sea. The Silver Pact has explored the ocean’s depths in search of it, as have others who’ve heard the blade’s legend, but none yet have found it.
Fond Remembrance has a curving blade of moonsilver, ornamented with etchings of flowers inlaid with petals of blue jade. Its hilt is wrapped in blood ape leather, the only hint to its demonic origins. Its name is engraved upon its pommel, in commemoration of the purpose for which it was forged. 
 
## Evocations of Fond Remembrance

Fond Remembrance’s wielder can alter memories with false memory gambits. They have a difficulty of the target’s base Resolve. Success lets the wielder insert herself into one of the target’s memories, comparable in length to the events of a single scene. She can either choose a memory of a specific occurrence that she’s aware of, or provide a general description — e.g., “a memory from adolescence” or “a memory about his neighbor.” Memories of the current scene can’t be altered.
If successful, the wielder’s player briefly narrates her actions and their consequences within the altered memory. Alternatively, she can replace someone already in the memory, reenacting their actions. The target sees her filling the same role as whoever she replaced — parent, friend, schoolyard bully. The memory rises to the target’s mind with uncanny clarity, making him aware of the wielder’s seeming presence in his past.
If a character’s memory has been erased by magic, a false memory gambit can fill in the blank with a reconstructed memory. The memory is based on the wielder’s recollection of the event, or her understanding of what occurred if she wasn’t there. The wielder can make changes as above.
Changing memories doesn’t change the target’s Intimacies — his emotions remain unaltered, even if he no longer understands why he feels that way. Likewise, alterations to one memory won’t affect others — if the wielder kills her target’s mother in a memory, he’ll remember both his mother’s death and her life thereafter.
False memory gambits don’t force targets to believe in the implanted memory — if it’s too inconsistent with their other memories or simply too implausible, they may believe it’s somehow been distorted or tampered with. Alcohol and drugs are often the first explanation to come to mind, though some may suspect the intervention of spirits, sorcerers, or the like.
A character who uncovers evidence that contradicts a false memory can pay five Willpower to remember the true event for one scene. If the evidence relates to one of his Intimacies, the cost becomes (5 – Intimacy) instead.
Once the scene ends, he forgets both the real memory and the fact that it was altered.
This alteration is a Psyche effect. It can also be undone by magic that weakens or removes Derangements, for which it counts as Major. If its effective intensity is reduced to Minor by such magic, the Willpower cost to temporarily resist it is lowered by one.
