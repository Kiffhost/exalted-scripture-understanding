Nest of Living Strands The martial artist shifts languidly through interwoven stances meant for eight legs, acting with grace and precision beyond humanity. The stylist rolls Join Battle twice, using each roll to establish a new Initiative track. She still only takes one turn each round, but at any point where the martial artist’s Initiative is relevant — determining her turn order, paying an Initiative cost, determining a decisive attack’s damage, resetting to base — she chooses which of her three Initiative tracks she wants to use in that instant. If she resets to base Initiative after a successful decisive attack or the like, she must reset the Initiative track used for that effect. The only exception is that when she resets to base Initiative, if one of her Initiative tracks is at or below base Initiative, she can’t choose to reset that one unless all of them are that low. If one of the martial artist’s Initiative tracks is crashed, it’s permanently lost. If this Charm ends, the stylist chooses which Initiative track she keeps but notes the other two, which she reuses instead of rolling if she reenters this Form that scene. Tracks lost to crash don’t return for the rest of the scene. 

## Special activation rules

When the stylist lands a decisive attack against a nontrivial enemy on the same turn she moves into or out of close range with him, she may reflexively enter this Form.
