*Mara appears in the sorcerer’s dreams, feeding her with fragments of stolen souls.*
Once per story, the sorcerer’s player may declare that she is visited by Mara in a dream while sleeping. She does not recover [[Willpower]] from that sleep, but receives some significant benefit determined by the Storyteller—tutelage in a new spell in a single night, double 9s on all shape [[sorcery]] spells for the next day, the service of a First Circle demon as a gift from Mara, or something similar. She also wakes with a Minor [[Intimacy|Principle]] of “I take pleasure in death and suffering,” or strengthens that [[Intimacy]] if she already possesses it.
