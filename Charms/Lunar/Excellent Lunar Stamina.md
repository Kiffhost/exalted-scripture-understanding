Add dice to an ([[Stamina]] + Ability) roll for 1 mote per die. 

The [[Stamina]] Excellency can raise [[soak]]. This costs 1 mote per point of soak, maximum (Stamina/2, rounded down).

While soak can’t be stunted, players can still raise the dice caps for these with a suitable description per the usual [[stunt]] rules, although this doesn’t add any other benefits of stunting.
