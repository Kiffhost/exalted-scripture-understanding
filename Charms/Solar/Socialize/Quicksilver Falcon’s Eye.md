With a supernaturally keen sense for social interaction, the Lawgiver can gauge a character’s response to any social influence. She can even tell conspirators from rivals at a glance. With this Charm the Solar can intuit when a character applies Resolve or Guile against social influence actions and when he doesn’t. When she makes an argument she believes her target will readily accept, but he applies his Resolve, she senses his hesitation. When he applies his Guile to occlude his intentions, she knows he’s hiding something. When characters engaged in an argument seem to disagree yet she sees no application of Resolve, this is a clear sign of a sham performance.
