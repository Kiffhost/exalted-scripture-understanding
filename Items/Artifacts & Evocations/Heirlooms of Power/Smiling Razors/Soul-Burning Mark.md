The Smiling Razors burn their mark into the flesh of victims with sadistic glee. Their wielder makes a withering attack. If it deals more than (5 + number of marks the victim already has) damage, it brands him with a mark that lasts until the sceneâ€™s end, maximum (Essence + 1) marks. Decisive attacks with the Smiling Razors gain one die for each mark the victim has. 

## Resonant

If the wielder lands an unexpected attack, it automatically marks her victim regardless of how much damage she deals.
