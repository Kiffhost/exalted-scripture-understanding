Perhaps you were a child lost in the warped depths of the Wyld or a hero treading where the logic of the world crumbles away. Perhaps you were already an initiated sorcerer, wracked by maddening dreams or secrets best left unknown. However it happened, you saw it. Something numinous, a forgotten god or primal monster that spanned the horizon, more beautiful than anything you’ve ever seen and more horrifying than anything you’ve seen since. You caught only a glimpse of this outer thing, but it has marked you. A sliver of the Wyld now resides within the deepest dreaming parts of your mind, and the power of chaos serves your sorcerous will.
