Moving with practiced discipline through whirling steps and dragon-claw mudras, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a seismic pulse of Earth Essence to strike aside an obstacle. Any natural earthen scenery that bars her path can be removed, such as fallen rocks that block a road, a boulder rolled in front of a cave mouth, or a pool of quicksand. The Storyteller describes the exact effects of this pulse on the scenery â€” it might cause piled-up stones to fall away, harden quicksand into solid terrain, shatter boulders, or cause stone to meld back into the earth. However, she cannot use this Charm to affect masonry walls or other man-made obstructions. Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood can create a bridge or stairway out of earth or stone to span a canyon, chasm, or similar gap. This cannot extend more than (Essence/2, round up) range bands from her.
