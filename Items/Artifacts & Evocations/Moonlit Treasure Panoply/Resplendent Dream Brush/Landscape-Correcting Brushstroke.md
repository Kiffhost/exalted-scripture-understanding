Improving on nature’s beauty, the artist paints a better world.
The artist invokes an Intimacy to reshape her surroundings, creating difficult terrain in a patch that extends out to short range from a point within medium range of her.
If there are any enemies within that space, the artist must roll (Craft + [Painting]) opposing their (Dexterity + Athletics) rolls to work around them.
The terrain’s appearance always reflects the invoked Intimacy in some way. The transformation reverts once the scene ends.
## Resonant
The artist adds (higher of Essence or 3) nonCharm dice on this Evocation’s roll.
## Dissonant
The transformation only extends out to close range.
