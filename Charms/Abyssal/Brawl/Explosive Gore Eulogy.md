*Having concluded her bloody sermon, Death’s Lawgiver casts what remains of her victim back into her allies’ arms.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Illustrative Overkill Technique]] after incapacitating a nontrivial enemy, she may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to make a decisive attack with her victim’s corpse, slamming or flinging it at an enemy within close range. Her [[Initiative]] doesn’t reset from the attack that triggered [[Illustrative Overkill Technique]]. The attack benefits from any [[Charms]] used on the initial attack, assuming they’re compatible, and the Abyssal can use additional [[Charms]] to benefit it.
If the Abyssal knows [[Terminal Velocity Approach]], this Charm’s range extends to short. She can increase it further by expending excess levels of damage, instead of adding them as successes on her threaten roll.
Forgoing one level extends it to medium, while three levels extends it to long.
While using [[Dark Messiah’s Wrath]], the Abyssal waives this Charm’s [[Willpower]] surcharge.
