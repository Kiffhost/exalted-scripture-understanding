*The Dragon-Blood sloughs off her anima banner as a cloud of mist that engulfs her ship, buying her a chance to flee unseen.*
In naval combat, she may use this Charm to attempt an escape stratagem (Exalted, p. 245) at a reduced cost of six Momentum. In addition, for each point of Momentum she has over the opposing captain after both pay the costs of their stratagems that interval, she adds one bonus die on the escape roll. This Charm can also enhance the interval roll for a pursuit at sea (Exalted, p. 244) in which she’s fleeing, imposing a penalty of ([[Essence]]) on the opposing captain’s roll. This Charm can be used outside of naval combat or naval pursuit, creating a large fogbank that covers the entire ship for one scene unless dispersed by magical or extremely strong winds.
