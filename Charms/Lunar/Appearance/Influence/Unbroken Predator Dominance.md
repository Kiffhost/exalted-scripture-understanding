*Standing tall despite grievous wounds, the Lunar terrifies her prey — if such wounds couldn’t fell the beast, what hope do they have?*
The Lunar ignores [[Health Track#wound penalties|wound penalties]] on a [[threaten]] roll or other fear-based [[Social Influence|influence]], converting them to bonus dice, and counts as having the [[Hideous]] [[Merit]] (Exalted, p. 162). If she already has [[Hideous]], she reduces [[Feral Smile Tactic]]’s mote cost by two if she uses it with this Charm.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has the Berserker Merit may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm, with [[Relentless Lunar Fury]] as its prerequisite.
