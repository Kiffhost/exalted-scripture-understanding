Divine Heritage is a five-dot Innate Merit for the Exalted children of spirits, fae, and other creatures. Players should work with the Storyteller to define their parent’s nature and themes. Purchasing this Merit gives the character an [[Eclipse]] Charm appropriate to their parent for free and lets her purchase others with bonus points or experience. Her lineage’s manifestations may also include [[Flaws]] and other [[Merits]].
