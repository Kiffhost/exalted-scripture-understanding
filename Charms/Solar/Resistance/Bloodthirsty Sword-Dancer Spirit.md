*While channeling [[Battle Fury Focus]], the Solar drops to a deeper level of consciousness, sinking into a meditation on violence and destruction.*
In this fugue state, her world !!narrowstoatightredtunnelwiththingsthatmustdieatthe!! far end. On top of the +1 bonus from [[Battle Fury Focus]], the !!Solargainsanadditional+2dicetoallofhercombatactions,!! !!ignoresallwoundpenalties,andgeneratesonemoteperturn,!! !!whichmustbespenteachturnoncombat-relatedactionsor!! !!physicalactionsinpursuitofcombat,violenceordestruction.!! In this state the Solar cannot be safely dissuaded from combat. Should friends or allies choose to stand in her way, she won’t slaughter them unheedingly, but will use any force necessary to remove them from her path so she can continue to assault her original target. She will not, and cannot end her assault until her targets are dead or fled, and if she is convinced by an impassioned plea to drop her commitment to this Charm, she will go into immediate [[Initiative]] crash. If she crashes herself in this fashion, her [[Initiative]] is set to -3. Ending this Charm while already crashed does not change the Solar’s [[Initiative]] value. When tremendously outnumbered, Bloodthirsty SwordDancer Spirit affords the Exalt renewed power: each time she empties a battle group’s Magnitude track, she may roll [[Join Battle]].
