*Moving with a speed beyond that of time itself, the stylist enacts this style’s ultimate killing art, a technique that Jehu Khoor forbade his disciples to use.*
The stylist makes a single decisive attack against any number of enemies she can perceive within medium range, blurring between them all in a split second, ending her movement anywhere within medium range of her starting point. This has a base damage of (Initiative/2, rounded up) against each enemy. Each enemy also suffers additional dice of damage equal to their onslaught penalty, including the penalty inflicted by this attack. Against battle groups, this attack inflicts an onslaught penalty equal to their Size and rolls the stylist’s full Initiative. Trivial characters are hit automatically and slain instantly. This uses the stylist’s movement action for the round.
Against enemies whose onslaught penalty equals or exceeds their Essence, this attack is unblockable and undodgeable. If it exceeds their Essence by three or more, the attack is an ambush.
