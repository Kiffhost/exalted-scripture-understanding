The presence of this hearthstone warms the land and air around it to the temperature it would normally assume in the height of summer. Both day and nighttime temperatures mirror summer equivalents. This effect extends for four miles around the stone and ends abruptly at the edge. If someone moves the stone, the warmth moves with it, but snow and frozen ground thaw only as fast as they would if exposed to normal summer temperatures.
The effect extends several yards down into the soil, allowing normal plant cultivation in the frozen depths of a northern winter.
