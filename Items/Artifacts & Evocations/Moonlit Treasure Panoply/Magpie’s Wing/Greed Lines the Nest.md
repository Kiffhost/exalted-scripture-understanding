Magpie’s Talon keeps a tight grip on plundered treasures, defying those come to reclaim what’s rightfully theirs.
The wielder reflexively makes a special disarm gambit against something that could fit within [[Magpie’s Wing]].
This isn’t limited solely to weapons — anything that could be stolen with a [[Larceny]] roll can be targeted. On a successful gambit, that object is trapped within the skycutter’s secret compartment before it flies back to the wielder.
The wielder can retrieve the stolen object from [[Magpie’s Wing]] with a ready weapon action, but it’s much harder for others. Even if they can get the [[skycutter]] away from the wielder — typically via a disarm gambit of their own — opening the hidden compartment while it’s reinforced by this Evocation requires a difficulty 7 lockpicking roll or feat of strength that must be enhanced by magic. Such feats of strength require [[Strength]] 5+. In combat, each such roll costs two [[Initiative]] and can’t be flurried.
If the wielder knows a Charm that lets her break the attunement of a stolen artifact, like [[Flashing Steel Reversal]] (Lunars, p. 192), upon successfully stealing an artifact with this Evocation she breaks that artifact’s attunement at no cost.
## Resonant
In combat, the compartment can’t be opened against the wielder’s will unless she’s crashed or incapacitated.
## Dissonant
This Evocation’s type is Simple.

## Special activation rules
A Lunar with [[Expansive Avarice]] can use [[Many-Pockets Meditation]] reflexively on a successful disarm to store the object.

## Reset 
Once per round.
