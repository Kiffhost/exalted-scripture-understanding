*The Sidereal speaks the truth but is not believed, inflecting her words with a tenor of unspeakable dread that makes listeners refuse to believe them.*
When the Sidereal makes a spoken influence roll or up to ten seconds of normal speech, everyone who hears her believes she’s lying and gaining a Minor [[Intimacy|Principle]] reflecting this. Characters whose [[Resolve]] is higher than the Sidereal’s [[Manipulation]] can spend one [[Willpower]] to resist. If a character with this [[Intimacy]] makes a roll opposing the Sidereal’s [[Guile]] that could reveal she wasn’t lying, he suffers +1 target number. This Charm can contest lie-detecting magic like [[Judge’s Ear Technique]]; the Sidereal uses her influence roll to oppose that Charm’s roll, or a ([[Manipulation]] + [[Lore]]) roll at −1 target number for normal speech.
