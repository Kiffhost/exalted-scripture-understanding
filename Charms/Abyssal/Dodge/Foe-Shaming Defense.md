*The Abyssal toys with her enemy, evading his blow at the last possible moment to force him to overreach.*
After successfully dodging an attack, the Abyssal can use this Charm to make an unblockable withering counterattack, rolling (Dexterity + Dodge) opposing the initial attack roll. The counterattack has (Essence + Dexterity + 5) raw damage and Overwhelming (higher of Essence or 3). If she damages her attacker, he’s knocked prone and suffers a −3 penalty on rolls to rise from prone.
The Abyssal doesn’t gain Initiative from hitting or dealing damage with this counterattack. Instead, she banks it in a separate pool until the end of the scene.
She also banks any Initiative gained by crashing her attacker. The banked Initiative can only be spent on Dodge Charms. It’s lost if she’s crashed or uses this Charm again.
