*By examining the undisturbed physical evidence of an event, the Solar can flawlessly reconstruct the physical process behind that event.*
Finding a corpse with a knife wound, she can tell what sort of knife was used, and from what angle the blow was struck. She can differentiate between blood spatters, assigning each to a different stroke of a weapon made at a different time, and so on. This Charm is not limited to crime scenes. The Solar can likewise reconstruct the evidence left behind by a liaison, examine the leavings of a camp site, etc. This acts as a normal [[case scene]] action, save that the Lawgiver does it in a handful of seconds, and gains ([[Essence]]) automatic successes and double 9s to her attempt.
