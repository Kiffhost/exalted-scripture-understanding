*Turning her gaze inward, the Abyssal glimpses feverish impossibilities of her own invention.*
The Abyssal can pay an additional four-mote surcharge when she uses Fervent Caprice Focus, making the Intimacy she gains an Obsession (Exalted, p. 169).
Doing so lets her spend banked successes on the following effects as long as it’s related to her goal:
4 successes: Add one white point toward the cost of a Craft project or Craft Charm.
5 or 7 successes: Use a Craft, Linguistics, Medicine, Occult, or Performance Charm that’s currently “down” without needing to reset it. This costs seven successes for Charms that can only be used once per story and five successes for other Charms.
7 successes: Waive the cost of a Craft, Linguistics, Medicine, Occult, or Performance Charm with instant duration.
7 successes: Temporarily gain a Craft, Linguistics, Medicine, Occult, or Performance Charm for Morbid Inspiration Witness’ duration. The Abyssal must meet its prerequisites and can only use it for purposes of her goal.
## Reset
Once per session, the Abyssal can invoke her Whispers to roll (Whispers) dice, banking her successes.
