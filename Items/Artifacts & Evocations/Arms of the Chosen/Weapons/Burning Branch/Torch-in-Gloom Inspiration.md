Holding her fiery brand high for all to see, the Exalt inspires her allies to go forth and purify the world of the monsters that darken its doors. While Burning Branch is ignited, she and all allies within short range gain 1 Initiative at the beginning of each round. She adds (Essence) bonus dice on all command actions, and treats the Drill of all battle groups under her command as one step higher. Groups that already have elite Drill gain Might 1 instead (Exalted, p. 207). This Evocation ends if the wielder is crashed. It can only be used once per scene.
