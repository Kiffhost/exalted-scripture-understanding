Tiny lights race through this coruscating crimson jewel. When placed in an attuned hearthstone socket, it grants the opportunity to awaken the following Evocations:
Flashing Heel Swiftness Cost: 6m; Mins: Essence 1
Type: Reflexive
Keywords: Perilous
Duration: Until next turn
Prerequisites: None
The Exalt’s movements become too fast to be natural. She treats her Initiative as three points higher to determine when she acts, and adds three bonus dice on both her disengage and rush rolls and on rolls to oppose other characters’ disengage or rush rolls. Darting Hand Quickness Cost: 3m, 2i; Mins: Essence 2
Type: Reflexive
Keywords: Perilous
Duration: Instant
Prerequisites: Flashing Heel Swiftness
Like a flame, the Exalt is in constant motion. She may reflexively take any Dexterity action other than an attack, regardless of Initiative order. This Evocation may only be used once per scene, unless reset by succeeding on an opposed Dexterity roll against a non-trivial enemy with 5+ total successes.
