Like the Unconquered Sun, the Solar is everywhere and nowhere at once. Moving at impossible, Essence-fueled speeds, the Solar becomes multiple copies of herself. As long as she keeps moving, she is each of her copies and none of them at the same time. The Lawgiver becomes a battle group having Size (Essence / 2 rounded up), Magnitude 10 (regardless of her maximum Health Levels), and no bonuses from Drill or Might — simply use the Solar’s normal combat pool. This Charm is incompatible with heavy armor, and incompatible with all Resistance Charms except those which are Permanent-type or Simple-type Charms which were activated before using Faster than Self Technique. Nor can the Solar benefit from giving her “battle group self” enhanced abilities through the use of War Charms. Each round this Charm is active costs the Solar an additional mote of Essence to keep active. In addition, when the Solar’s Magnitude track fills up with damage and she loses a point of Size, instead of a rout check she is subject to a difficulty 3 Stamina + Athletics roll to maintain the Charm. Ending this Charm gives the Exalt a -1 success fatigue penalty to all of her Athletics rolls for the next three rounds. Faster than Self Technique can only be activated once per scene. 

### On Faster than Self Technique

The backer’s friend, Koray Bilgin, is the genius behind this Charm. He came up with the name, the concept, and the framework of the mechanics. I just took care of balancing issues and placement in the tree. It’s a really fantastic idea! Backer: U. Kaya YAVUZ
