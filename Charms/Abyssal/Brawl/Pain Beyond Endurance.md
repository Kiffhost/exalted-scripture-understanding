*Striking without regard for anything but breaking her victim, the deathknight floods his mind with pain.*
The Abyssal makes a withering attack, adding an automatic success on the attack roll and ([[Essence]]) raw damage. It ignores soak, except the natural soak from an enemy’s [[Stamina]]. She doesn’t gain [[Initiative]] from this attack — instead, for every two [[Initiative]] she’d gain, her enemy’s wound penalty increases by −1 until the start of his next turn.
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal gains [[Initiative]] from the attack as usual.
