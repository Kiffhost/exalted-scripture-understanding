*Casting aside compassion, restraint, and humanity, the Nemesis Cuirass’ master revels in invincible hatred.*
## Resonant
Only wearers who are resonant with the Nemesis Cuirass can awaken this Evocation.
To use this Evocation, the wearer must have a positive Major or Defining Tie that’s relevant to a fight, whether it’s applicable to her enemies or her motivation for battling them. She sacrifices that Tie and rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) with ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm successes, banking a special pool of [[Initiative]] equal to her successes. This has the following benefits:
 - She gains [[Hardness]] equal to amount of [[Initiative]] she currently has banked. If the Cuirass’s [[Hardness]] is higher, it’s increased by +1 instead.
 - When she takes withering damage, she may choose to lose [[Initiative]] from this pool before her own [[Initiative]]. Attackers don’t gain [[Initiative]] for points lost from this pool.
 - When she makes a decisive attack against an enemy she has a negative Tie toward, she may add up to ([[Intimacy]]) of this [[Initiative]] to her damage dice. She can use this to make decisive attacks against such foes even while crashed, treating her own [[Initiative]] as zero before adding from this pool.
 - She can use it to pay the cost of [[Bitter Malice Empowerment]] and any other instant-duration [[Charms]] she uses together with it.
The wearer can’t regain the sacrificed [[Intimacy]] by any means until the end of the story.
