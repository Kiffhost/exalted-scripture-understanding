Preying on suspicion and paranoia, the Lunar sows rumors of herself. She accuses someone of being an impostor, rolling a special (Manipulation + [Larceny, Performance, Presence, or Socialize]) instill roll against his (Charisma + [Bureaucracy, Performance, Presence, or Socialize]) roll, rerolling a failed die for each of his 1s. She can accuse someone who isn’t present, but at a –3 penalty, and he still rolls. If successful, the Lunar’s extra successes become an instill roll against all other characters present to create a Tie of suspicion toward the accused character, convincing them that he’s a disguised conman, shapeshifter, possessing spirit, etc. Characters already watching for a suspected impostor must pay an additional Willpower to resist this influence. As long as affected characters retain the instilled Tie, their read intentions rolls against the accused yield false positives — giving them a definite sense that something’s wrong with his behavior or appearance — unless their successes also beat the Lunar’s Guile. This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived if it’s used with Tarnished Silver Imprecation. 

## Special activation rules

The Lunar may activate this Charm reflexively when she uses Wolves-in-the-Mist Incitement, waiving its Willpower cost, to convey both Charms’ effects with Wolves-in-the-Mist Incitement’s roll.
