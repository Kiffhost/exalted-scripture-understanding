The Solar walks among the wicked as a demon and a saint. Gathering all the speed and skill of her hands into the channel of her Essence, her talent is forced out through her skin, manifesting in a burning corona that coats her hands in the fires of her anima. For a moment, the gloves suffuse her hands and blaze. For the next thirty seconds or two rounds, whichever comes first, no member of a criminal organization nor creature of darkness may Join Battle against the Lawgiver or roll to attack her. During this time, each of her allies gains +3 automatic successes to any attempt to escape the scene. After this effect ends, her hands continue to blaze. She may mute the effect with just a thought: her Null Anima Gloves fade to invisibility. They are still there, however. Should she use her hands to block an attack, land a strike, or steal an object, they will flash and hum back into existence, and remain that way until she banishes them. This is merely a visual display, however… Null Anima Gloves convey the following powers: 
- Raiton’s Unerring Claw: Once per full anima progression, she may reroll any Larceny-based action involving her hands.
- Flashing Whip, Silent Whip: Once per day, she may use a free full Larceny Excellency to enhance an attempt to pickpocket or steal from plain sight. •	Seize the Day: In combat, she may use a gambit which costs three Initiative to make a (Dexterity + Larceny) based decisive attack against her opponent, with double successes on the Initiative roll. If she succeeds, she regains four Initiative and steals an additional amount from the opponent equal to her Dexterity, adding it to her own total. The Exalt must be close enough to touch her opponent to use this technique and must use her hands to make the attack. Seize the Day can only be used once per battle, but is automatically reset when the Solar climbs to 15+ Initiative after landing a decisive attack which returns her to base Initiative.
- Dream-Ending Gesture: With a curt flash of her hand, the Solar rips away the proof of her foe’s divinity. The Exalt uses a gambit costing five Initiative, making a (Dexterity + Larceny) based decisive attack against her opponent, with double successes on the Initiative roll. If the Exalt’s gambit succeeds, she steals a number of motes equal to her extra successes on the attack, adding them to her peripheral or personal motes. Dream-Ending Gesture can only be used once per scene. 
- Steal Inertia: Once per battle the Exalt may reflexively enact a (Dexterity + Larceny) Clash against an attack. This Clash is enhanced by (Essence) automatic successes. If her successes cancel her opponent’s, she can be seen to stop the blow with her blazing, anima-suffused hands, and may automatically respond with a disarm gambit at no cost, using extra successes on the Clash as automatic successes to her gambit’s Initiative roll. 
- Hand-Spear Convocation: Upon stealing an artifact, she experiences a rush of power that surges through her body and floods into her hands, supplying the motes needed to attune the artifact, effectively reducing the cost of attunement to 0. This may only happen once per scene.
