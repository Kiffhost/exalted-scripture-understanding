*The Abyssal’s killing intent takes form as a spectral weapon, a vicious bow of night-black [[Essence]] or a flamewand roaring with sickly green pyreflame.*
The Abyssal creates an artifact [[Archery]] weapon from [[Essence]]. The type of weapon created and its exact appearance are the same each time she uses this Charm.
The deathknight can use [[Relic Arrow Method]]’s dice-adding effect to enhance attacks made with the summoned weapon without regard for its once-per-scene limit, although each use beyond the first incurs a one-mote surcharge.
This Charm may be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation to the summoned weapon. These [[Evocations]] draw their themes and function from the deathknight’s personality, Caste, and iconic anima banner.
