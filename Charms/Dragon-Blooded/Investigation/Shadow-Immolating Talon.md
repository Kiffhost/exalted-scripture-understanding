*Her claws unsheathed, the Dragon-Blood brings fire down into the shadows and returns with truth.*
She can use this Charm to enhance a decisive attack made with any Ability, confronting her enemy with a question or accusation as she attacks. She adds ([[Essence]]) bonus dice on the attack roll and doubles 10s on the damage roll. If the Dragon-Blood’s successes on her attack roll exceeds her target’s [[Resolve]], he’s compelled to answer her question or accusation honestly, without deception or half-truths. Even an enemy incapacitated by the attack has time to answer in his final moments. If this would oppose one of his Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he may pay a point of [[Willpower]] to give an answer that is cryptic, half-true, or incomplete. If a character doesn’t know enough to give the Dragon-Blood an answer, the attack gains no benefits and the cost of this Charm is refunded. [[Shadow-Immolating Talon]] can only be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a significant enemy that the Dragon-Blood knows has committed a crime that offends one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. It doesn’t need to be reset if its target is unable to answer.
