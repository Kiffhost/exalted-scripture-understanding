*Thorny vine whips grow from [[Burning Branch]] to constrict weapons disarmed by it, letting them hang like war trophies from its bladed tines.*
If a disarm gambit supplemented by this Evocation succeeds, [[Burning Branch]] ensnares the enemy’s weapon. As long as the Evocation’s mote remains committed, retrieving the snared weapon requires a difficulty 4 gambit. If [[Burning Branch]] has been ignited, weapons snared with this Charm become superheated. Once they’ve been cut free, decisive damage for picking up the weapon increases to the wielder’s ([[Essence]]). 

## Resonant

The Exalt may stack this Evocation up to ([[Dexterity]]) times to entangle that many weapons. Each must be cut loose separately.
