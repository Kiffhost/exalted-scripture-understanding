Similar to the prerequisite, the Exalt may raise a manse from chaos. In order to do this, the Solar must be on at least phase four of Wyld-Shaping Technique in which she has created land with at least three major demesnes. She may then use this Charm, consuming three major demesnes back into the Wyld and raising an exceptional manse in their place.
