*Bringing her hammer down with bone-breaking force, the wielder crushes her enemies.*
This Evocation enhances a decisive smashing attack, trading a single level of damage to inflict a penalty equal to (lower of wielder’s [[Essence]] or [[Strength]]) on that enemy’s attack and movement rolls for the rest of the scene. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation’s crippling effect only lasts for (higher of 3 or [[Essence]]) rounds. 

## Resonant

The wielder may use this Evocation reflexively after successfully hitting with a smash attack but before damage is rolled.
