The Sidereal blesses another with the experience of being her, leaving a ghostly imprint of her Caste Mark on his left hand. The Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Presence) to instill one of her Major or Defining Intimacies in a single target. His Intimacies don’t modify his Resolve against this roll. Success instills the Intimacy at Major intensity in a rush of emotions, but it subsides to Minor once the scene ends. As long as the target has the Intimacy, it counts as Defining for gaining Willpower from upholding it and for purposes of his Charms and other magic. The mark left by this influence can’t be seen after the instant in which this Charm is used except by characters capable of seeing the dematerialized. It vanishes if the target ever erodes that Intimacy.
