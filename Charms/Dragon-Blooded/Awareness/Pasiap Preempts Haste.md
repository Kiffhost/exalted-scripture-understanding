*The Dragon-Blood is as patient and still as a mountain, waiting for the perfect moment to act.*
She doubles 9s on a [[Join Battle]] roll. If she wins [[Join Battle]], she waives the [[Initiative]] cost of delaying her action (Exalted, p. 196) on the first round, and adds ([[Perception]]) bonus dice on her attack roll if she delays it until after an enemy acts.
