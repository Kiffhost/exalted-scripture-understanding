*The Exalt inspires loyalty such that the very beasts of the field flock to her call.*
Once per combat, the Exalt may make a reflexive [[rally for numbers]] action (see p. 210), adding ([[Essence]]) automatic successes. While this Charm cannot restore a dot of [[Size]], any successes beyond the battle group’s total [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] will be restored in the rounds following the battle group taking additional damage, at a rate of up two [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] levels per round. A Solar whose appeals are sufficiently compelling—a level two stunt—will see wild animals leaping into the fray on her behalf, while a Solar whose call for retribution strikes with resounding force—a level three stunt—will be answered by the very rocks and trees, as elementals and other strange spirits rise up to join her ranks.
