Echoing Luna’s legend, the cloak’s master brings night to the world.
The Lunar may pay a ten-mote surcharge when she uses Veiled in Midnight to bring an end to day:
 - The darkness extends out to long range.
 - The Evocation’s duration becomes one hour.
 - The fall of darkness counts as sunset for purposes of magic that can only be used at that time or that gains additional benefits at night. If the wearer uses this to cast a demon-summoning spell, the ritual’s duration is shortened to one hour.
 - The Lunar gain one sorcerous mote on the start of each of her turns as long as she remains within the darkness.
 - The Lunar’s anima banner doesn’t impede Stealth rolls she makes within the darkness.

## Special activation rules
The Lunar may use Shifting Penumbra Stance and Subtle Chameleon Practice reflexively with this Charm, waiving their costs.

## Reset 
Once per day.
