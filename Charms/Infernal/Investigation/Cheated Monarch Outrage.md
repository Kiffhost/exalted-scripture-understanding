*The Infernal picks at old wounds of betrayal to keep the pain sharp, honing her intuition to detect the faintest pangs of treachery.*

When someone breaks a promise or betrays a superior in the Infernal’s presence, she reflexively makes a profile character roll against him. She doesn’t need to be aware of the character to use this Charm. Success lets her identify the offender if she can see him, or tell that someone nearby has just committed such an offense. For every three extra successes, the Infernal’s player may ask the Storyteller a question about it: “What promise was broken?” “Who did he betray?” “What was he offered to do it?”

If the culprit’s misdeed was directed against the Infernal herself, he suffers a Guile penalty equal to her Essence, and the offense counts as a crime for purposes of other Investigation Charms.
## [[Keys]]
#### Inescapable Master’s Fury (Investigation 5, Essence 5) (+5m, 1wp)
If one of the Infernal’s peers or subordinates breaks a promise to her or betrays her, she can pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm no matter where he is. This is true even if he’s in another realm of existence, though the Infernal’s read intentions roll suffers a −3 penalty. If she knows [[Inevitable Manhunt Summons]], she can sense whether the culprit is within its range. Once per story, she can use that Charm reflexively to hale the offender to her if he’s within range, using the extra successes on the profile character roll to set its difficulty. The once-per-story limit doesn’t apply for mortals and First Circle demons.
