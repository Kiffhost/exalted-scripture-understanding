*Sworn to the end of all life, the Abyssal recognizes those who share her red-handed calling.*
The Abyssal senses whether someone has ever killed another person, seeing hallucinatory bloodstains on the hands of those who have. The more deaths he’s caused, the greater the profusion of blood, giving the deathknight a general sense of how many lives he’s taken. She senses both direct and indirect responsibility for death, seeing blood on the hands of both an assassin and his employer or a soldier and the king who ordered him to war.
This Charm is usually unrolled. However, the Abyssal must make a special profile character roll if her target has a relevant Intimacy — a Tie of guilt, a Principle of pride in never being caught, etc. That Intimacy increases his Guile against her roll, like with Resolve.
She must also make this roll if such a revelation would compromise her target’s disguise or significantly complicate it.
This Charm isn’t dependent on vision — a blind Abyssal might identify killers by a ghostly chorus of the victim’s wails or some similar omen.
### Whispers
If the Abyssal successfully identifies a killer, she may invoke her Whispers to receive a fleeting vision that somehow relates to the most recent death.
While such visions are too brief and hazy to provide directly actionable information, they may supply leads, identifying people, places, or events where Crime-Unveiling Wickedness might lead the Abyssal to relevant information.
