The artist paints with lightning and wildfire.
The artist can pay a two-[[Initiative]], one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses Landscape-Correcting Brushstrokes to create an environmental hazard instead of difficult terrain. It has difficulty ([[Intimacy]] + 2), Damage ([[Intimacy]] + 3)L/round. If she has to paint around enemies, they oppose her roll with the same (Attribute + Ability) pool used to resist the hazard. If she succeeds, they must use that roll’s result against the hazard as well.
The hazard’s nature or appearance always reflect the invoked [[Intimacy]] in some way. It fades away once the scene ends.
## Dissonant
Characters who are dissonant with the [[Resplendent Dream Brush]] can’t awaken this Evocation.
