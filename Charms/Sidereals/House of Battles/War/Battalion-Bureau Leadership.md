*Understanding the logistics of warfare, the Sidereal effortlessly adapts to other kinds of battlefields.*
The Sidereal gains the following benefits on a project (Exalted, p. 226) or other bureaucratic task for an organization she leads, or one whose leader she advises
- She can use War instead of Bureaucracy for rolls related to the project.
- The organization’s members count as experienced warriors for Battle-Fellow Attitude’s effects. If they’ve previously worked on a project led by the Sidereal or someone she advises, they count as having fought under her command.
- She waives the mote cost to lower the target number of rolls related to the project with Excellencies. This never applies to rolls in combat.
- Rolls to interfere with or sabotage the project suffer +1 target number. If organization members come under attack while working on the project, they gain −1 target number to Join Battle.
