*Chaos-Banishing Revelation Gesture The winds banish smog and miasma; the running river washes away pollution.*
Embodying all the purifying power of Creation, the Dragon-Blood cleanses curses and spiritual malaise. This Charm is an extended ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) action that can be used to free one character of a sorcerous curse, such as the spell [[Corrupted Words]], or a shaping effect that transforms the victim’s body. It can also lower the intensity of a magically inflicted [[Derangement]] by one step. However, sorcerous workings can’t be broken with this Charm. The extended action has a difficulty equal to (the [[Essence]] of the character that imposed the effect), a goal number of (that character’s [[Essence]] x10), terminus 10, and an interval of one month. The Dragon-Blood must use this Charm at each interval, anointing the beneficiary with sacred cleansing water or using ritual fans to drive away evil. Some curses are beyond the power of this Charm to purify. This includes [[Solar Circle Sorcery]]; the magic of the Celestial Incarnae, Yozis, and [[Deathlords]]; or any other effect the Storyteller deems completely beyond the capability of the Terrestrial Exalted to break.
