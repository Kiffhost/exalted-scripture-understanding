*Slaughtering the living, the Abyssal replenishes the ranks of the damned.*
The Abyssal adds one die of decisive damage on attacks against the living. Mortals slain by the Abyssal will rise at the end of the scene, reanimated as zombies (Exalted, p. 502) with Defining Ties of loyalty to her that can’t be weakened.
With [[War]] 5, mortals slain by battle groups led by the Abyssal are also reanimated.
