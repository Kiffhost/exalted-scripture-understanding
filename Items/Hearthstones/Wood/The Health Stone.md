*This stone is mahogany red and marked with a black spiral.*
It repels spirits of rot and disease within two miles of the stone. Food keeps at least twice as long and is always obviously foul before it can make anyone sick. Also, everyone within this area who wears an amulet marked with a spiral like the one on the stone gains two additional dice to resist and recover from all diseases and infections. This stone does not prevent desired fermentation or aging, but aged meat is less likely to rot and wine and beer are less likely to go off.
