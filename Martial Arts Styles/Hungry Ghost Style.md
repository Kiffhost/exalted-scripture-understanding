Most stories of this style’s origins tell of a village, city, or temple overrun by the walking dead. Without weapons or training in battle, the few survivors learned from the only teacher they had, drilling in techniques devised by watching the ravenous ghosts at their hunt. While the truth of such tales is disputed, the style’s schools can be found in many places throughout Creation where the living must fear the dead, like the shadowland-haunted streets of Chiaroscuro, the outlying settlements around Whitewall, or the tide-flooded lower neighborhoods of Wu-Jian. 
The style’s intense physical discipline, emphasizing forceful blows driven by bursts of speeds, belies the spiritual facets equally important to practitioners. Students cultivate power within their lower soul by embracing their most intense and primal passions, at times attaining an almost ecstatic frenzy in battle. Those unfamiliar with the style who see its techniques in use may believe practitioners to be monsters themselves.
