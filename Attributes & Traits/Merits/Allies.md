This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
Each purchase grants the character a single noteworthy Storyteller-controlled ally—a close friend or trusted companion with some useful capabilities. The nature of this ally must be defined at the time the Merit is purchased.
One dot grants a mortal or very minor supernatural ally, who may possess useful contacts, political clout, refined expertise, or other resources he is willing to put at the character’s disposal, within reason. Three dots grants a supernatural ally at least as powerful as a young Terrestrial Exalt. Five dots grants a supernatural ally as powerful as one of the Celestial Exalted. The Storyteller has final say over what constitutes a valid ally.
### Drawback
Allies aren’t automatons or flunkies. They have their own lives and concerns, and expect the character to provide the same assistance to them that they provide to her. A mistreated ally is likely to abandon the character or even become her enemy.

#### Lunar
A Lunar’s Solar mate is a five-dot Ally.

#### Sidereal
Fellow Sidereals are five-dot Allies. Powerful gods are five-dot allies, but most gods are three-dot Allies.
