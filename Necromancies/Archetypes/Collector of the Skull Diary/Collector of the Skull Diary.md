Looted from the manse of a necromancer-recluse slaughtered in the [[Usurpation]], the Skull Diary, as it came to be known, was a collection of a thousand blackened skulls decorated in ciphered [[Language#Old Realm|Old Realm]] inscriptions. Their sizes run the gamut from the skulls of delicate youths to wizened elders. A few even bear prehuman features. Each skull murmurs of its final moments, sharing harrowing tales of gruesome [[sacrifice]] and necromantic experiments when pressed to the ear. Sympathetic and curious listeners are rewarded with necromantic secrets. 
Bound together in death yet scattered across [[Creation]] and the [[Underworld]] in the millennia since the Usurpation, each skull of the Diary seems to possess a limited intelligence, growing wiser and more cunning when reunited with other skulls. As one’s collection grows larger, the wisdom they offer grows more esoteric, delving into depths of little-known necromantic theory. Wielders of these necromantic relics hunt obsessively to amass their own collection, often coming to blows with their rivals. Some portions have been sealed in mortal or heavenly vaults, while others are guarded by mindless necromantic constructs and ghostly horrors in the recesses of the Underworld

Or awaken Evocations from the Skull Diary:
Exalted necromancers may awaken Evocations from the Skull Diary as a three-dot [[artifact]] (Arms of the Chosen, p. 18). These may allow her to glean more wisdom from the Skull Diary’s collective knowledge, or draw on themes of resonant ritual [[sacrifice]], secrets of the Black Nadir Concordat, and enhancing necromancy through amassing more of the skulls.
