The Lunar reveals the inner beauty of others, letting them fall in love with themselves. Touching a reflective surface no longer than one range band in any direction (or a portion of a larger reflective surface), she suffuses it with anima. Treat any character’s reflection that appears in the surface as though it were using Attention-Demanding Presence against that character only, with an Appearance equal to the higher of his Appearance or the Lunar’s own Appearance. While using this Charm, the Lunar may pay two motes to make an Appearance-based influence roll against a character via his reflection, which speaks to him in a voice that only he can hear. Influence that would create a Tie toward her instead creates a Tie toward the targeted character. She can’t be identified as the source of such influence.
