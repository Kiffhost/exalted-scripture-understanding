With a rousing shout, the Dragon-Blood agitates an enemy’s mount, driving it to flee or charge unwisely. She makes a ([[Charisma]] + [Presence, [[Survival]], or Ride]) threaten roll against an animal mount, doubling 9s. If successful, the mount reflexively moves one range band in a direction of the Dragon-Blood’s choice, taking its rider with it. It won’t move into obvious danger, such as off a cliff or into a bonfire, but it can be made to move within range of perils it’s unaware of. Mounts can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist this influence unless they’ve been trained for battle or have a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] that opposes this influence.
