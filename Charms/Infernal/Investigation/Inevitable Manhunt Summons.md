*The Infernal has no time to chase after reprobates. The road of perdition that they walk leads inevitably to her justice.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she succeeds on a case scene roll with 3+ extra successes to uncover evidence of a character’s crimes or misdeeds. The offense must be either serious or life-changing. If the culprit is within (Essence x 3) miles, she senses his presence, though not his location. She can then pay ten motes and one Willpower to hale him before her. He rolls (Wits + {Larceny, Occult, or Survival}) at a difficulty equal to the Infernal’s extra successes on the case scene roll. If he fails, he finds himself drawn into the Endless Desert, seemingly between eyeblinks. Any nearby companions can follow him through the hellish rift before it closes.

The culprit and his companions find their way back to Creation after one hour for each mile between him and the Infernal. If he was less than a mile away, this takes only a few minutes instead. The wanderers reappear in a sand-strewn breeze somewhere within medium range of the Infernal. If multiple characters arrive, the Infernal instinctively senses which one is the culprit.
