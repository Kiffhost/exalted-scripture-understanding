So steadfast is the Solar that those who would sway her find their efforts undone by their own uncertainties. After a character uses an instill action in an attempt to diminish one of the Solar’s Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], the Exalt may use this Charm to select one of the initiate’s non-success numbers. If she selects 1s, ([[Essence]]) 1s in the roll act as -1 success to the attempt. If someone speaks ill of that which she loves, the Solar will find a flaw in his arguments. If she selects any non-success number other than 1s, instead of negative successes she can force the initiate’s player to reroll up to ([[Essence]]) successful dice, starting with the target number (usually 7) and moving up. In this case, the initiate always keeps the lower of the two results. This Charm cannot be used in combination with Righteous Lion [[Defense]]. The Exalt may only use this Charm to successfully defend an [[Intimacy]] once per [[Intimacy]], per story. She can use this to defend the honor of her Lunar mate and uphold her dedication to the Mask of Winters’ fall, but she may not use this Charm to defend either the Lunar or her enmity for the Deathlord more than once per story. This effect can be reset by exploring the claims that were made on the back of an instill action. If it was claimed that her Lunar was adulterous, she might elect to begin an investigation. If the Solar confirms such claims to be false, the Charm is reset.
