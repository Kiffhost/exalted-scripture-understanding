*The Sidereal has many questions for the world, and none can keep her from their answers.*
When the Sidereal uses a Charm that lets her player ask the Storyteller questions, like Infallible Broker’s Confidences, she waives the mote cost to lower the target number for that Charm’s roll with an Excellency.
Additionally, on a successful roll, the Sidereal’s player can ask an additional question for every two extra successes, rather than every three.
With Secrets Ability 4, Essence 2, the Sidereal’s player can ask an additional question for each extra success, rather than every two.
