# [[Black Claw Style]]
Black Claw style is one of the rare few martial arts created by a demon, taught to the Exalted in the First Age by Mara, the Shadow-Lover. It uses misdirection, misperception, and love as its primary weapons. Black Claw stylists seize victory by opening themselves to their enemies’ aggressions, casting themselves as innocents who suffer the strikes of callous brutes or sadistic madmen. Defeat is mollified by exposing the perfidy of the victorious. Throughout the course of a fight, a Black Claw stylist manipulates the emotions of those watching her, turning them against her enemies and winning their love. A master of the style can pick a fight against the most noble of opponents, yet walk away beloved, while her foe feels the scorn of the crowd— even as his heart crumbles to ashes in the master’s hand.
Every student of the Black Claw style has a Tie of love to the sifu who taught it to her. It is impossible to know the secrets of this style without being exposed to the innermost heart of one’s instructor, and impossible to understand that knowledge without accepting what’s within that heart. This love is both genuine and unbreakable. While the [[Intimacy]] can be weakened down to Minor intensity, it cannot be completely removed or have its context altered by any means, mundane or magical. Such is the nature of Mara which pervades every Charm of her style.
## Weapons
This style uses exclusively unarmed attacks, emphasizing claw strikes and sudden, lunging kicks. 
## Armour
Black Claw style is incompatible with armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
Black Claw stylists often feign the appearance of fighting on the defensive, using [[Dodge]] to both evade attacks and disengage from close combat. [[Presence]] is also useful to them, as many of their [[Charms]] allow them to sway the hearts and minds of enemies and bystanders alike in combat.
