*Death’s Lawgiver rips secrets from her suspect’s mind, battering down the doors to mind and soul.*
The Abyssal makes a special [[profile character]] roll to pull information from someone’s mind. If successful, she can psychically interrogate them, as with [[Unsurpassed Interrogation Method]]. She can choose to learn one of the target’s Intimacies instead of asking a question.
If the Abyssal succeeds, her victim can feel a malevolent presence intruding on his mind as she seeks out information, but can’t identify her as the source. Once her interrogation is complete, his memory of it is erased unless he spent [[Willpower]] to refuse at least one question.
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal can invoke her [[Whispers]] to ask an additional question. She can wait until after using her other questions to do so.
