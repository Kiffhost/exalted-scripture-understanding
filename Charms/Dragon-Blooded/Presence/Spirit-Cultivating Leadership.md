*The Dragon-Blood is a source of strength for her followers and attendants, helping them realize their true potential through her leadership.*
She may use this Charm on a character with a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to her. For the duration of this Charm, he gains the following benefits: 
- +2 [[Resolve]] against any influence that would weaken his [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the Dragon-Blood. 
- Three temporary specialties of the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s choice, distributed among the [[Archery]], [[Athletics]], [[Awareness]], [[Brawl]], [[Dodge]], [[Integrity]], [[Martial Arts]], [[Melee]], [[Presence]], [[Resistance]], [[Ride]], [[Sail]], [[Survival]], [[Thrown]], or [[War]] Abilities. 
- One extra [[Willpower]] per day, which may only be spent resisting social influence. This cannot raise him above his permanent [[Willpower]] and is lost at the end of the day if not spent. The Dragon-Blood may use this Charm on up to a maximum of ([[Essence]] +3) characters at a time.
