*The sabers disarm enemies of spiritual power, shedding drops of anima and [[Essence]] as sure as blood.*
A successful disarm gambit also causes its target to lose (1 + [[Initiative]] roll’s 10s) motes, maximum (wielder’s [[Dexterity]]). The wielder chooses which mote pool they’re drained from. 
## Resonant
The wielder gains the lost motes, adding them to the same pool they were drained from.
