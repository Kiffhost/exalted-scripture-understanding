The Lunar strains her might to its utmost and beyond. Sheadds+1toherStrengthratingtodetermineifshemay attempt a feat of strength (Exalted, p. 229). If successful, she may complete a feat that normally takes an extended period of time, such as bashing through a brick wall, in an instant, if the Storyteller deems it feasible. Even if not, the time required to complete it is dramatically accelerated. 
## Protean 

In an animal shape that already meets a featâ€™s Strength minimum, the Lunar instead adds a nonCharm die.
