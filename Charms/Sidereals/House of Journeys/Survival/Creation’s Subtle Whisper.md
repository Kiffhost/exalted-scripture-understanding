The land whispers to the Sidereal, telling her what she must know. The Sidereal communes with the surrounding region with a (Perception + Survival) roll against difficulty 1-5, based on her familiarity with it and any impediments to interacting directly with its flora, fauna, and natural features. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
-  What’s a relevant detail about nearby flora or fauna? 
-  What’s the overall mood of the nearby region’s spirits? 
-  What’s a nearby manse, demesne, or other place of power that I’d be interested in, and where is it? 
-  What’s the most significant threat to the land itself, and where is it? This is typically a shadowland, bordermarch, baleful sorcerous working, or other large-scale supernatural force. If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact. Reset: Once per scene.
