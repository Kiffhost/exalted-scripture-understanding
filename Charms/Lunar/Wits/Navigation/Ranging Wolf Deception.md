Those who hunt the Lunar find themselves her prey. She conceals her tracks and those of up to (Essence x2) companions, rerolling (Essence) failed dice and removing the limit on how many successes she can add with Lodestone Reckoning Manner. Mounts don’t count toward the limit on companions. She designates where the false tracks lead to — either a specific locale she’s familiar with, or simply a direction and distance. Characters who fail their tracking rolls believe they’ve succeeded, and that the Lunar’s party traversed the false path. This can fool even superhuman or magically enhanced senses. This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived within territories claimed using Boundary-Marking Meditation (p. XX). 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape has Camouflage may learn this as a Manipulation Charm, with Night Sky Burial (p. XX) as its prerequisite. Cache
