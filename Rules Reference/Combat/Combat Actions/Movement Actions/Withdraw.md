This action is used to escape from the battlefield completely, losing any pursuit that may be following. It is an [[Action#Extended|extended]] ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) roll, difficulty 1, goal number 10, interval one round. It may only be attempted if the character is at [[Range#Medium]] or greater from all opponents. 

Using a withdraw action moves the character one [[Range]] band away from his enemies, and causes the character to lose 10 [[Initiative]] per round—this can be done even if it would result in a negative [[Initiative]] value. Succeeding at the extended roll causes the character to move an additional range band away from his opponents. If the character succeeds at a withdraw action’s extended roll while at [[Range#Extreme]] from all opponents, they successfully escape the battlefield for the rest of the scene, evading all pursuit.
