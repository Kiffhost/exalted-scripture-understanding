The Sidereal binds devils to Heaven’s service, teaching them humility and repentance as they bear her on her journeys. The Sidereal creates a stardust bridle and makes a (Dexterity + Ride) gambit to place it on an unExalted enemy of fate within close range. The gambit’s difficulty is (higher of target’s Essence or 3). Success turns her enemy into a horse with a noticeably otherworldly appearance that reflects his nature. He uses a horse’s traits (Exalted, p. 566) instead of his own for physical actions and can’t use his Charms or other magic. He retains his cognitive faculties, memories, and Intimacies. If the gambit’s attack roll also beat his Resolve, he gains a Defining Principle of “I must allow the Sidereal to ride me” that can’t be weakened or altered. Dice added by this Intimacy on rolls to resist the Sidereal’s arcane fate are converted to automatic successes. Both effects endure for (1 + Sidereal’s extra successes) days, or that many months for characters whose Essence is lower than the Sidereal’s. If a transformed character with Essence 1-3 has or forms a Defining Tie of loyalty, obedience, or the like toward the Sidereal, he becomes her familiar permanently. She may choose to reverse the transformation or to render it permanent. Reset: Once per story.
