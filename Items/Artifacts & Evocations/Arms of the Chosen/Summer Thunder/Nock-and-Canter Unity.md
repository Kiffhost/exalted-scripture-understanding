A steed’s shifting gait only serves to better guide Summer Thunder’s arrows. The Exalt instantly takes an aim action. This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing, incapacitating, or unhorsing a non-trivial opponent. 

## Resonant

The wielder may pay an additional Willpower to take two aim actions, allowing her to attack at medium range or further while still receiving bonus dice.
