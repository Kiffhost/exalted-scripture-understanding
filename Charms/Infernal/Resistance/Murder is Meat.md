*Violence is the Infernal’s nature, sustaining her as she sups on slaughter.*

When the Infernal kills an animal that’s at least as large as she is or a human, she derives a day’s worth of sustenance from the act, forgoing the need for food and water. Once per scene, she can also gain (target’s Essence + 2) motes, if he’s nontrivial. She only gains these benefits if she turns her back on her victim’s remains and moves away from them. (This doesn’t require a movement action in combat.) The sustenance from multiple uses of this Charm stack.

Additionally, the Infernal may harm mortals without it counting as a violation of any positive Intimacies she has for purposes of gaining Limit or other effects. This doesn’t apply to positive Ties toward the specific individual the Infernal harms.

With Resistance 5, Essence 3, each death provides the Infernal with a week’s worth of sustenance. With Essence 5, this becomes a year’s worth.
## [[Keys]]
#### Incarnate Divinity Appetizer
The Infernal broadens her palate. She chooses two of the following: gods, elementals, fae, and the undead. She can use this Charm to feed on slain demons and on entities of the chosen type. When she does, she can use her Essence in place of the victim’s to determine how many motes she gains. She gains an additional two motes for doing so. She can also safely eat and derive sustenance from such beings, if she couldn’t already.
#### Palate for Annihilation (Resistance 4, [[#Incarnate Divinity Appetizer]])
[[#Incarnate Divinity Appetizer]]’s effects apply to the remaining types of the listed beings. Once per day, the Infernal can gain Willpower when she feeds on one of them, or two Willpower if it had Essence 5+.
#### A World of Meat (Resistance 5, Essence 3, [[#Palate for Annihilation (Resistance 4, Incarnate Divinity Appetizer )|Palate for Annihilation]])
[[#Incarnate Divinity Appetizer]]’s effects apply to all animate beings not already encompassed by this Charm, such as constructs. The Infernal can regain Willpower with [[#Palate for Annihilation (Resistance 4, Incarnate Divinity Appetizer )|Palate for Annihilation]] once per scene.
