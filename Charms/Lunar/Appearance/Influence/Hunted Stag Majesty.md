When the Lunar is ambushed (Exalted, p. 203), she reflexively makes an (Appearance + [Performance or Presence]) persuade or threaten roll — a flash of seductive beauty undermines her assailant’s nerve, or her fearsome bearing makes him think twice. If successful, the ambush automatically misses. If the attacker’s Resolve is beaten but he resists with Willpower, he makes the ambush normally, but this Charm’s Initiative cost is refunded.
