Expecting no peace in her travels, the Sidereal is rarely disappointed — or caught off guard. The Sidereal gains the following benefits: 
-  She adds (Sail) dice on Perception rolls with any Ability to notice hidden dangers while traveling (by ship or otherwise), and on Join Battle rolls while aboard a vehicle. 
-  She strikes fear into the heart of oceangoing foes: enemy sailors, sea monsters, hostile aquatic animals, and similar marine enemies count as having a Minor Tie of fear toward her. 
-  When she recruits a surrendered foe into her crew, any negative Ties he has toward her are lost and he gains a Major Tie of loyalty to her. 
-  In naval combat, she reduces the Momentum cost of naval stratagems by one if the roll’s target number is reduced by any amount. Positioning stratagems instead award one extra Momentum, even if they fail.
