Dots: 1 or 2

The Infernal deflects attacks by projecting shimmering planes of mental force, conjuring basalt edifices from the Demon City or otherwise obstructing her enemies’ fire. Ranged attacks against the Infernal suffer a −2 penalty. She can focus her defenses with an unrolled take cover action, providing light cover against close-range attacks and heavy cover against others until she next moves from her current location.

For two dots, the Infernal’s defences are more expansive. Against attacks from medium range or further, the attack roll penalty increases to −(higher of Essence or 3). Allies within close range of her can use a take cover action to shelter behind her, gaining this feature’s benefits for as long as they remain within close range.
