Death awaits all things that live; the Sidereal merely looks ahead to this foregone conclusion. The Sidereal makes a special (Perception + Endings Ability) read intentions roll against a living character. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
-  What’s his greatest vulnerability? 
-  What is he willing to die for? 
-  If he died, would any unfinished business cause his ghost to linger? 
-  If he died, who would mourn him? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact. Reset: Once per scene.
