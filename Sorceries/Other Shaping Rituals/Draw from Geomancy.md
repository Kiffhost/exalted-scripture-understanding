The sorcerer may bathe in the geomantic fires that burn in her manseâ€™s heart to gain ([[Essence]] + [[Willpower]]) sorcerous motes, at the price of taking a level of aggravated damage. These motes last for a fortnight, or until she next claims motes from the manse. While within the bounds of the manse, she also gains one additional sorcerous mote each turn while casting a spell.
