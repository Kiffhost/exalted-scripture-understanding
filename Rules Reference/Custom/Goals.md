![[Limit#Legendary Social Goals]]
Despite their importance to [[Limit]], [[Willpower#Gaining Willpower]] and some [[Charms]], there is little guidance about what constitutes a social goal (called character goal in the Abyssal book) or story goal. I propose the following:
- Clearly defined. It should be clear when the goal has been achieved, you should be able to sum it up in a sentence.
Character\Social Goals should be:
- Related to an intimacy, or else even more core to the character.
	- It need not be a powerful or long-held intimacy, but often should be.
	- The goal need not align with the intimacy. E.g. getting over a difficult beak-up.
	- Fulfilling a goal may result in a change to the associated intimacy.
Story Goals should be:
- Earned. Any task too trivial to the characters is unlikely to be a suitable story goal.
- A point of inflection. Story goals should herald a change in the story going forward.
	- E.g. Reaching the end of a journey, to now begin creating a spy network. Completing the training of a militia, so the characters need not remain nearby to protect the village.
### Note
Despite the mention of "legendary" social goals and "major" character or story goals, there are no mentions of any other levels of such goals.
