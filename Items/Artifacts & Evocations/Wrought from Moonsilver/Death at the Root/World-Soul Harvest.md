Death at the Root drinks deeply of the world’s power, stealing it for itself. After using Cutting the WorldRoot to suppress a demesne or manse with (its Merit rating) extra successes, the wielder may pay ten motes and one [[Willpower]] to draw its [[Essence]] into one of the grimcleaver’s hearthstone sockets. Over the next day, a duplicate of that demesne or manse’s hearthstone forms within that socket (assuming at least one is empty). It shatters if removed. Such hearthstones are always Steady (Exalted, p. 604), even if the original isn’t. This Evocation can only be used once per story.
