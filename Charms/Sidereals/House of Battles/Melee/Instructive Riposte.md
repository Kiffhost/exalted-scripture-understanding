*Waiting for her foe to make the first move, the Sidereal tests his offense and demonstrates its vulnerabilities to him.*
The Sidereal makes a decisive counterattack in response to any attack, even if it isn’t against her. She can’t use this Charm if the attack’s target uses a Clash or Counterattack Charm of his own.
With a Melee 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm even if the attack’s target clashes or counterattacks.
