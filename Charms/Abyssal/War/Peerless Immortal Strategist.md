*The deathknight’s commands direct her forces with brilliance and precision denied mortal generals.*
When the Abyssal makes a Strategic Maneuver roll, she adds an automatic success and ([[Essence]]) dice and chooses up to ([[Essence]]) stratagems that she might potentially enact. She may allocate her extra successes among these stratagems however she wishes, and can use multiple stratagems if she rolls enough successes.
