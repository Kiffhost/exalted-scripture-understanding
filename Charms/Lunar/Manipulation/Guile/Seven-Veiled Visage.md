Endless layers of misdirection enfold the Lunar’s innermost self, concealing it from all but the most impeccable discernment. (Essence) 1s on a roll opposing the Lunar’s Guile subtract successes. She can’t use this Charm against characters she’s unaware of. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar is in a human shape the opposing character has a Defining Tie toward, failure casts him into despair over his inability to understand someone who means so much to him. He suffers a dice penalty equal to the 1s on his roll, maximum (Lunar’s Essence), on social and mental actions for the scene.
