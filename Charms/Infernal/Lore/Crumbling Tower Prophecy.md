*The Infernal’s dreams are filled with fitful images of the future calamity, visions that ought never come into the waking world.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she sleeps for a full night, making a difficulty 3 ({Intelligence or Perception} + Lore) to witness flickers of future events in dreams. Success lets her player ask the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every three extra successes:
- Who currently poses the greatest threat to me?
- What currently poses the greatest threat or obstacle to my agenda?
- What currently poses the greatest threat to the surrounding region as a whole?
- Where am I most vulnerable to opposition, and how?

Such nightmares are harrowing: if the Infernal asks more than one question, she can’t regain Willpower from sleeping and forms a Minor Intimacy based on fear related to the answers. However, she can use any answers she receives as if they were Lore backgrounds until she next sleeps.

If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind, the Infernal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
## [[Keys]]
#### The Shape of Things to Come
The Infernal can prophesy more clearly if she commits to taking a Major Intimacy of fear in advance, or if she spends a full day sleeping. She can ask an additional question for each extra success, rather than every three. She can ask follow-up questions for any answer she receives in addition to the questions listed above.
