*The force of the Lunar’s blows shatters her foe’s stance, leaving him reeling and defenseless.*
If the Lunar’s attack deals damage, her target’s onslaught penalty doesn’t refresh on his next turn. Until it refreshes, the onslaught penalty is doubled for his [[Defense|Parry]] and he can’t take [[full defense]] actions. Successive uses of this Charm can prolong these effects by potentially preventing that foe’s onslaught from ever refreshing.
