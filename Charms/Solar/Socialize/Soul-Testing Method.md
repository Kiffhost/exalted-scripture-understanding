The Solar can draw on a mutual history or shared experience in order to make a powerful appeal. If the Solar shares a deep emotional connection to a specific society or culture with another character — as represented by an identical Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] they both hold — then the Lawgiver may use that bond to convince a target not to take an action the Solar disapproves of. This puts the character in a decision point immediately, without a roll, allowing them to evaluate whether the connection they share with the Solar outweighs the decision they have made. This Charm ignores restrictions on [[Intimacy]] use in decision points — the Exalt may use this Charm even if the target has already cited the shared [[Intimacy]] in a decision point. Nor does it count as exploiting a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the Solar directly. With a stunt, the Solar can also use a shared experience (such as serving in the same mercenary company during a legendary battle) as a reason for persuasion, even if there is no actual clear [[Intimacy]] being shared. This powerful social influence Charm can be used once per story.

### On [[Soul-Testing Method]]

The backer wanted a [[Socialize]] Charm that would exploit cultural ties to allow him to reason with his enemies. I expanded it so that it would be effective for a much broader set of characters. This Charm augments social bonds and ties that exist between people, basically using the Solar’s legendary reputation and the target’s emotional connection to an event to make them stop and think about what they’re doing.
