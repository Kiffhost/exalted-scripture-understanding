The Tusk remembers its days as one of the otherworldly horrors that preyed on Creation. It knows that each of its kindred has a weakness, no matter how invulnerable it may seem, and seeks that weakness like a bloodhound. The wielder makes a decisive attack that targets a weak point on the body of an enemy larger than a human, ignoring half the target’s Hardness (round up) and adding (Essence) dice of damage. If the enemy has Legendary Size, she adds (Essence + Strength) dice instead. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with moonsilver, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she Joins Battle against a non-trivial quarry after tracking it to its lair or otherwise hunting it down. 

## Resonant

If the wielder uses this Evocation against her quarry, she also doubles 10s on the damage roll. If her quarry has Legendary Size, she doubles 9s as well.
