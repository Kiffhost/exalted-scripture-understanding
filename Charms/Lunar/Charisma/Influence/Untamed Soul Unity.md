Standing between wilderness and civilization, the Lunar forges a sacred bond between human and animal. She makes a special ([[Charisma]] + [Performance, [[Presence]], or Survival]) instill roll against an animal, ignoring the [[Resolve]] bonus for lacking a common language. If successful, it becomes the familiar of a character present in the scene (including the Lunar), forming a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty. The animal serves as a familiar until the story’s end, but if its [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty becomes Defining, it remains permanently. This Charm costs an additional [[Willpower]] against animals that would be two-dot familiars (Exalted, p. 161), and can’t be used against animals that would be three-dot familiars or animals that are already someone’s familiar. If the Lunar grants her Solar mate a familiar, it immediately forms a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]]. She waives the [[Willpower]] cost to bind a two-dot familiar, and can bind a threedot familiar for a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge.
