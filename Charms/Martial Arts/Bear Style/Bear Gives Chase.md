*Moving with terrifying speed, the stylist grabs hold of an enemy before he can even try to move away from her.*
When an enemy disengages from the stylist, she can oppose it with a reflexive grapple gambit. If she succeeds, she gains the [[Initiative]] her enemy lost from disengaging after after she pays the gambit’s [[Initiative]] cost.
## Mastery
The stylist can also use this Charm to make a reflexive grapple gambit after she succeeds on a rush.
## Terrestrial
This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round. If she’s already attacked this round, it counts as her attack for the next round.
