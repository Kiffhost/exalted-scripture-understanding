As the Solar strengthens her defining Principle, she can also draw strength from the Principles that sustain her. This Charm allows the Solar to channel power through a Defining Principle not protected by Righteous Lion [[Defense]]. As long as she upholds this Principle at the Defining level, she may use it to reflexively shake off and ignore one of the following forms of magic: 
 - Fiat-level alterations to her destiny. 
 - Sorcerous curses such as the spell [[Corrupted Words]]. 
 - Psychic assaults of any kind. 
 - Magical attacks that would transform her body in some unwanted way. 
 
 The Solar becomes aware the moment such magic is used on her, and may commit motes to this Charm to rebuff it, becoming immune to all such magic until she drops the commitment. If the Solar wishes to change the Principle this power draws on, or if she wishes to garner a different immunity, she must drop the committed motes and spend one scene without this Charm’s protection, a scene in which she acts in accordance with the Principle she plans to exemplify. This Charm cannot draw on a Defining Principle that isn’t apparent in the character’s actions. It can be a Principle the character keeps hidden, but it can’t be one notreferencedconstantlythrough the character’s thoughts, actions, or personality. As always, the Storyteller is the final arbiter of whether a character’s Intimacies are accurate, and has the power to adjust them accordingly. At [[Essence]] 5+, the cost of this Charm drops to seven motes, one [[Willpower]].
