*Ducking and weaving, the snake confounds predators’ attempts at violence.*
[[Serpentine Evasion]] adds +1 to the martial artist’s [[Defense|Evasion]] against a single attack. If the attack is made after the martial artist has already taken her turn that round, she may declare this Charm after the attack has already been rolled—enemies who cannot even keep pace with her in battle have no hope of striking her. 
## Mastery
Successfully evading an attack after using this Charm cumulatively lowers the cost of subsequent activations of it by one mote until the martial artist’s next turn.
