*Her hands moving with blinding speed, the Abyssal hastens her patient’s return to the slaughter.*
The Abyssal completes up to an hour’s worth of medical treatment in a handful of seconds, potentially letting her use Simple [[Medicine]] [[Charms]] in combat. With an appropriate stunt, she can do so even if she lacks necessary tools and supplies.
