Sometimes, the worst consequences of battle are not wounds dealt on the battlefield, but the diseases that fester within them. Characters who take lethal or aggravated damage in combat run the risk of sepsis. Sterilizing wounds with alcohol after a battle reduces the virulence of the infection to 2, while cauterizing them with a flame or heated iron prevents infection altogetherâ€”at the cost of a level of bashing damage from the minor burn. [[Exalted Healing|The Exalted and other supernatural characters]] never suffer infected wounds.
