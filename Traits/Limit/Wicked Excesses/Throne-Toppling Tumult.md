The Infernal turns her wrath upon those in authority. She works actively to oppose and destroy rulers and states through the most efficacious means available, rousing dissident activity, sabotaging civic infrastructure, undermining bureaucracies, stoking destructive riots and ultimately executing princes and ministers.

**Duration**: Session.
Throne-Toppling Tumult can be ended prematurely if the Infernal’s efforts result in serious damage to her long-term plans.
