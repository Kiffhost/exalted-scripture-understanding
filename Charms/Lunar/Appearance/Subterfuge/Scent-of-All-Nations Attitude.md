*Though she travels many lands, the Lunar is never a stranger.*
Anyone who encounters her assumes that she’s a fellow member of his polity or ethnicity, inferring significance in subtle aspects of her bearing and overlooking differences in appearance, dress, language, or mannerisms that contradict this impression. She may thus benefit from positive Ties others have toward members of their own culture and evade negative Ties rooted in xenophobia. If a character’s successful read intentions or [[profile character]] action against the Lunar reveals information that contradicts this belief, he realizes that his first impression was mistaken, although not that she magically deceived him. Alternatively, the Lunar may appear as a member of a specific nationality or ethnicity to all who see her. This is more difficult to see through; read intentions or [[profile character]] rolls that would reveal contradictory information suffer a –(Lunar’s {higher of [[Appearance]] or Manipulation}/2) penalty. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as a [[Manipulation]] Charm.
