*The Lunar trails pheromones like heady perfume, beguiling and distracting pursuers.*
When she takes a [[Conceal Evidence]] or [[Conceal Tracks]] action, she also makes an ([[Appearance]] + [[Presence]]) instill roll with ([[Appearance]]) bonus dice to create a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward herself (or her current shape). Characters casing the scene or [[Tracking]] her must first contend with this influence. A character whose [[Resolve]] is beaten suffers a −(Lunar’s [[Essence]]) penalty and his 1s subtract successes, even if he spends [[Willpower]] to resist.
