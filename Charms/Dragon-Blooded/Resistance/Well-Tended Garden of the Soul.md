*The Dragon-Blood beckons to the Wood [[Essence]] that moves through the wilderness, calling forth healing renewal from the forest’s boughs.*
In a barren wilderness, it’s sufficient that she touches a single shoot of green life to use this Charm. She weaves her hands through a series of mudras that ends in a flash of anima that leaves every plant out to medium range radiant and flourishing, traced with hints of green anima. Any blighted or diseased plants are healed, while mundane plants that have died of winter frost or drought might be revived. On her next turn, the blessing of life circles back unto her, unless this Charm is interrupted before then by her being crashed, taking decisive damage, or being forced into a range band devoid of plant life. She rolls ([[Essence]] + [[Stamina]]), unmodified by other effects, and heals a single level of non-aggravated damage for each success. This Charm can only be used once per day.
