The Ascending (Caste) Horoscope Charms lets players make dramatic edits, providing a lucky break or opportunity.
Examples include discovering that an unexpected but helpful item is somewhere at hand, having a helpful character show up at just the right moment, declaring thereâ€™s a hidden door just in time to escape, etc.
The Storyteller can veto dramatic edits that stretch credulity or feel out of place, but they should propose a narrower version of that edit that still provides a significant advantage.
