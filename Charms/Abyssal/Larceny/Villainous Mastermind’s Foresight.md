*The ever-thoughtful criminal, Death’s Lawgiver remains three steps ahead of rivals and investigators.*
After a scene spent making preparations, the deathknight rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Larceny]]), banking contingency points equal to her successes. She might prepare by casing a building, stealing useful information, forging credentials, bribing local law enforcement, laying groundwork for an alibi, or the like.
The Abyssal may spend contingency points on the following effects reflexively:
3 points: Waive [[Red-Handed Villain Artistry]]’s cost.
3 points: Retroactively reveal exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for a specific [[Larceny]] action ([[lockpicking]], [[disguise]], etc.) on the deathknight’s person.
3 points: Make a [[conceal evidence]] roll retroactively to conceal a piece of evidence. The Abyssal can use magic to enhance this roll as usual. The contingency point cost to use [[Inescapable Burden of Guilt]] or [[Red-Handed Villain Artistry]] on the roll is reduced by two points each.
3 points: Waive the [[Willpower]] cost of a Charm that enhances [[disguise]].
4 points: Waive [[Inescapable Burden of Guilt]]’s cost.
5 points: Gain +2 [[Guile]] or [[Resolve]] for one scene.
5 points: Reduce [[Insidious Shade Infiltration]]’s cost by five motes.
7 points: Retroactively erase a small piece of evidence, making it impossible to detect or uncover by any means.
The Abyssal must know any [[Charms]] enhanced with [[Villainous Mastermind’s Foresight]].
