*Ghostly nails rivet the Abyssal’s armor to her flesh while chains of spectral [[Essence]] coil around it, binding her in steel.*
The Abyssal seals herself in her armor. Heavy and medium armor reduce their mobility penalty by −1, as if they were an extension of her body. Light armor gains +1 soak, reinforced by spectral chains and rivets.
If it’s artifact armor, it also gains +2 [[Hardness]].
The Abyssal’s armor can’t be removed by any means while this Charm is active — not even her own efforts. Mundane armor becomes as durable as an artifact. [[Artifact]] armor’s attunement can’t be broken by magic.
To end this Charm, the Abyssal must rip herself free of her armor, using the normal rules for removing it (Exalted, p. 591). This increases her wound penalty by −2 for the rest of the day. This isn’t necessary for armor created by magic like [[Wraith-Forged Plate]], once that armor fades away.
