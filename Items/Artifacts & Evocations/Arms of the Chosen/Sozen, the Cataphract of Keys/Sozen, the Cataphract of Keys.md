Era: Fall of the First Deliberative 
---
Sozen’s name is spoken in whispers in the Demon City’s gaminghousesandseraglios,itsalleywaysandthieves’dens. Even Hell has its laws and boundaries, and when one wishes to break them, who better to turn to than the Cataphract ofKeys?Nobrazengatecanbarherway,northousand-eyed sentinel glimpse her passage. She is queen of Hell’s underworld, admired and feared, a legend made flesh. She also does not exist. When the first Solar Deliberative collapsed, its embassy to Malfeas — perhaps an ill-considered venture — vanished utterly. Seeking a lover thus lost, Thousand-Named Orphan pledged to sieve Hell to find her again. He went to Zakhar of the Yellow Lamp for aid, that drunken apostate priest said to be the era’s finest artificer. Zakhar forged the Orphan a suit of armor containing the Essence of a demon that never was, laboring with such skill that the world itself forgot that Sozen was false. Thus clad, the Orphan walked the Demon City’s brazen streets for seven years undiscovered. A mass of spiked orichalcum plates tarnished green by demonic Essence, Sozen covers its wearer from head to toe. Each plate’s underside is filigreed with occult glyphs of starmetal and black jade. The faceplate is an exaggerated demonic mask; even when worn, there appears to be nothing behind the eye and mouth slits. An Exalted wearer’s anima throbs with unnatural colors — poisonous greens and purples,opalescentsheens,andflickersofnamelessdemon hues. Only her iconic manifestation’s natural color scheme remains untouched. 
 
## Evocations of Sozen,

the Cataphract of Keys While an attuned Exalt wears the armor, she takes on Sozen’s aspect and mien. None can distinguish her true identity short of magic such as Eye of the Unconquered Sun (Exalted, p. 273). Powers that reveal creatures of darkness will perceive her as such, but other magics that specially affect creatures of darkness do not treat her as one. While in the Demon City, the wielder gains access to the familiarity distinction of Seasoned Criminal Method (Exalted, p. 315) even if she lacks that Charm. If she does know it, it offers the benefits of a Major Intimacy. Sozen generates specific ominous phenomena. Shadows twist and writhe around the wearer, dancing like revelers. Where she walks, vegetation rustles, while standing water bubbles like a rushing brook. As she speaks, the strings of musical instruments vibrate, sending forth tangled echoes of former songs. At her touch, tarnish spreads across mirrors like frost.
