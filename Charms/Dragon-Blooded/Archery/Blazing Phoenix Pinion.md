*Threading incendiary anima through her arrow, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a shot that erupts in a glorious blaze upon impact.*
After spending a turn aiming, she makes a decisive attack, adding ([[Essence]]) dice of damage. On a hit, as long as she rolls at least one 10 on her attack or damage roll, the arrow explodes in an unblockable blast that extends out to short range from her target. All characters caught within it, including allies, must dodge her original attack roll or suffer dice of [[Hardness]]-ignoring lethal damage equal to the total 10s on both her attack roll and the original damage roll. The original target of her attack cannot dodge the blast. Any character that takes damage from the explosion is knocked prone and catches fire, suffering ([[Essence]]) further dice of lethal damage each turn until he extinguishes himself.
