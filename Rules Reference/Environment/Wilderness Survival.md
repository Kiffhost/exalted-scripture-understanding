See also: [[Environmental Hazards]]

Most of the time, it can be assumed characters traveling or camping in the wild have taken sensible precautions to keep from starving, dehydrating, or being gnawed on by wildlife. When characters *haven’t prepared for being thrust into the wilderness*, or are trying to forge their way through *particularly hostile environments*, a simple ([[Intelligence]] or [[Wits]]) + [[Survival]] roll is sufficient to take care of food, water, and shelter. The difficulty is determined by the harshness of the environment; trying to provide for a handful of unskilled individuals in addition to oneself is likely to raise the difficulty.

It’s generally not fun to outright kill players’ characters in response to failed [[Survival]] rolls; instead, treat failure as opportunity to introduce interesting plot complications.

Perhaps a poorly-weathered sandstorm injures a hired guide, or inadequate shelter results in disease-carrying insects descending on the travelers. Perhaps hostile locals appear once the characters have finally secured some game, to contest them for it.</details>
