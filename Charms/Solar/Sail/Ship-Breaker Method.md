Infusing the prow and ram of her ship with hardening Essence, the Solar empowers her ship to cut through the enemy’s hull like a spear. This Charm supplements a ram maneuver, causing the attack to do one extra level of damage. In addition, this Charm automatically defeats a broadside maneuver, damaging the enemy ship and canceling the broadside attack completely. To avoid transparency, the player should not declare this Charm aloud, but should write it on a piece of paper and keep it face down until the dice have been rolled.
