The Dragon-Blood’s anima thickens to a viscous liquidity, slowing or even stopping projectiles in mid-air.
She imposes a –(Anima) penalty on the attack roll of a ranged attack with a physical projectile or flame-based ranged attack against her Evasion. If the attack hits, up to (Anima) 1s on the damage roll subtract successes, or (Anima) 1s and 2s for flame-based attacks.
If the Dragon-Blood successfully dodges an attack with a physical projectile, the projectile becomes caught in her anima banner. She can pluck these suspended projectiles from her anima for her own use. If her anima fades to dim, all suspended projectiles fall to the ground.
