All that exists belongs to the Infernal by right. She attempts to acquire anything of particular value or desirable quality in her presence, and then seeks out more, never satisfied. Treasures she considers priceless and worth killing for in one moment are discarded as mere baubles the next, her insatiable avarice always driving her on to the next prize.

**Duration**: Session.
Luxurious Hoarding Tendency can be ended prematurely if the Infernal suffers injury due to her acquisitive efforts.
