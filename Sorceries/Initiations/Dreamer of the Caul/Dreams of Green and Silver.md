## [[Dreams of Green and Silver]]
Once per story, while engaging in austerities, entheogens, ecstatic rituals, or the like, the stylist experiences a strange vision or dream involving the Caul or its mysteries. She rolls ([[Essence]] + [[Willpower]]) and earns sorcerous motes equal to her successes, which last until the story ends. Once per story, she can stunt to declare that the events of a subsequent scene were foreshadowed by her most recent vision, gaining ([[Essence]] x {stunt + 1}) sorcerous motes for that scene.
