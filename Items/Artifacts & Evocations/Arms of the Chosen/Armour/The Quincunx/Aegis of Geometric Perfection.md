The Quincunx’s design embodies perfection, channeling its wearer’s [[Essence]] to harmlessly disperse force. The wearer may spend up to ([[Essence]]) motes on this Evocation before an attack is rolled against her. If she is shaping a spell, she may spend up to ([[Essence]] + [[Occult]]) instead. Each mote spent reduces the raw damage of a withering attack by one, while every three motes spent, rounded down, reduces decisive damage by one die.
