# [[Single Point Shining Into the Void Style]]
Single Point Shining Into the Void is a sword style that emphasizes blinding speed and deadly-perfect finishing moves. Students learn to draw their blade as though it were an extension of their own body, transitioning effortlessly from the draw to a strike or parry. When a master duels a lesser swordsman, the fight often ends in a single stroke, the blade sheathed almost in the same instant it’s drawn. When faced against a foe who matches her in skill, the Single Point stylist fights with swift blows and an almost meditative focus, seeking the single moment of weakness in her foe’s defenses that will allow her to slash through him entirely.
## Weapons
This style uses [[Slashing Sword|slashing swords]] and their artifact equivalents, reaper daiklaves, delivering lightning-fast attacks from the draw. It cannot be used unarmed.
## Armour
This style is compatible with light and medium armor.
