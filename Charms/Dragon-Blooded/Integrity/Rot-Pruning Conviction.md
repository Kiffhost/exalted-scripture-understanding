*The Dragon-Blood prunes the garden of her own heart, removing diseased buds to make room for new growth.*
When she spends [[Willpower]] to resist an influence roll that aligned with one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], she may shed that [[Intimacy]] entirely. In its place, she forms a new Minor [[Intimacy]] that reflects her reasons for resisting the influence. She canâ€™t shed [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] to her Hearthmates this way.
