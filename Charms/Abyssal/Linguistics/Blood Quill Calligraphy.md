*The Abyssal poet’s blood serves as ink, her finger more deft than any quill.*
The Abyssal can write without ink or implements, using her finger like a stylus to scribe words in her own blood. This adds (Essence) automatic successes on written threaten rolls and other fear-based influence.
Ties of fear to the undead and Principles expressing a negative outlook on death always penalize character’s Resolve against it.
With Linguistics 5, the Abyssal’s writing is unaffected by the passage of time, weather, and similar causes of damage or degradation, as does whatever surface it’s written upon. It bleeds through attempts to cover it up.
It can only be removed by a character’s direct efforts; actions to do so have a minimum difficulty of (higher of Essence or 3).
