*The necromancer gazes into a blue-white bonfire to spy through the eyes of the restless dead.*
The necromancer tosses bone dust upon a flame in a ritual to scry on an undead character no matter how far away he is. The undead must have a Defining Tie of loyalty or obedience to the necromancer unless she possesses a symbolic link to him, like a fingerbone or a lock of a deathknight’s hair. She rolls (Perception + Occult) against the target’s Resolve. Success lets the necromancer see through the target’s eyes by peering into the fire, allowing her to make her own Perception rolls and use magic to enhance them. She must remain within close range of the fire, and the level of focus required leaves her completely unaware of her surroundings.
While the necromancer spies, her target’s eyes glow with blue flames that betray her presence. This spell ends if her vessel is destroyed or if magic capable of exorcising spirits is used to drive her out of it. If the target is part of a battle group, it can be singled out as an elected target (Exalted, p. 416).
## Control
The necromancer’s eyes glow with the eerie blue flame of the bonfire. She can scry through up to (higher of Essence or 3) undead, making a single roll against all of them. She can only view one undead’s perspective in the flames at a time but can switch between WHY BIND GHOSTS?
While necromancers often bind ghosts for their deathly magic and to use them as unseen spies and servants, most summon the restless dead for their knowledge. Necromancers seek the names and burial grounds of dead princes for their secrets, summon the shades of vengeful courtiers to uncover blackmail on their confidantes or rivals, and the ghosts of savants for their wisdom.
While death and ghostly passions often distort memories of life, bound ghosts typically possess enough knowledge to be of use to the necromancer. Specific ghosts summoned for their knowledge possess an action pool of 6–8 dice in a relevant subject.
(Essence)i/round. This withering damage is unsoakable but doesn’t award the necromancer Initiative. Crashed enemies fall prone, bowing before their master.
The throne cracks and crumbles if the necromancer rises. It can also be destroyed with a difficulty 5 feat of demolition requiring Strength 3. At the end of the scene, if the necromancer remains seated, her throne fossilizes, becoming non-magical but permanent.
## Control
Any mundane chair the necromancer is seated in transforms to befit her majesty, ossifying into elegant bone over the course of a minute. The transformed throne provides this spell’s bonus on influence rolls of awe, fear, and envy.
## Distortion (9)
The throne tightens around the seated necromancer like a fist, holding her in place until the start of the distorting necromancer’s next turn. She can’t take movement actions and suffers a −3 penalty to all physical actions.
