Fivefold Bulwark Stance ignores wound penalties, onslaught penalties, penalties from being grappled, and penalties incurred from being hit by temporary physically crippling techniques other than those that affect the senses. However, it is vulnerable to attacks that cripple the senses, such as those that cause blindness or dizziness, and attacks which physically stun the Solar (such as Ox-Stunning Blow). Poisons and illusions may also cut through the Solarâ€™s Defense through use of this Charm. Thus Fivefold Bulwark Stance deals handily with the most common group attack tactics, but is vulnerable to more specialized tactics. These penalties do not apply to Dipping Swallow Defense or Bulwark Stance.
