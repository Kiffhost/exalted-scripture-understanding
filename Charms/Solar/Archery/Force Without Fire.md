The Solar nocks an arrow with purpose, sending a tremulous pulse through her surroundings as she gathers hurricane force into her bowstring. The Solar makes a withering attack from short or close range, and a pulverizing bolt of force surrounds her arrow as it leaps from her bow. If the attack does at least as much damage as her targetâ€™s Stamina, that Initiative is lost rather than transferred to the Solar, and the target is knocked down and back an entire range band. This force is sufficient to end a rush against any target.
