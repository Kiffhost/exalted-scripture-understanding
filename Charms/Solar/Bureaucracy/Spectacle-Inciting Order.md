If the Solar has established herself as a person of business renown in an area and has a practice or organization that is currently functioning, then she may use this Charm once per season to call a prestigious and strange package to be delivered to a local market or other place of public commerce. This delivery comes to Creation through a spirit court, a raksha court, or from the court of the ancestors, and what is inside will be strange, ethereal, or morbid as matches its source. In any case, the package is wrapped in glorious, scintillating, luminously textured paper, but is magically bound by a ribbon and can be opened by none other than the Solar. The package draws fascinated crowds and it is automatically perceived as something wondrous, a gift from the gods, or something strange and exciting. Roll the Solar’s unmodified Intelligence + Bureaucracy against a difficulty of 2 to determine the package’s Resources value. The Solar does not know what is in the box before she opens it, but she does know its exact value the moment it is delivered, and may trade on the expectation of what might be inside. Through repeated use of this Charm, and the eventual delivery of goods which are nigh priceless, the Solar can drive up speculation on the mysterious delivery and, on the fiction of never knowing the value of what’s inside, she can sell away something utterly worthless for a fortune, and can keep something priceless for herself, or use high Resources packages to entice future prospects into bigger gambling, business partnerships, and so on.
