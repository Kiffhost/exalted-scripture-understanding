*Flesh dances beneath the deathknight’s touch, knitting wounds shut and sloughing off rot in a chorus of sickening pops and squelches.*
After an hour spent treating a patient, the Abyssal diminishes any aggravated damage her patient suffers from into lethal damage. When used on animated corpses, this takes only a few minutes.
The Abyssal can use this Charm together with [[Flesh-Mending Discipline]] to reattach recently severed limbs and mend similar crippling effects. After treating the site of the injury with this Charm, she can use [[Flesh-Mending Discipline]]. The difficulty is based on the wound’s severity, as if it were a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201). The Abyssal must forego levels of healing equal to the maximum amount of damage that injury could be taken for.
When used on living patients, this Charm can’t revive dead tissue or regenerate missing tissue. This typically requires that treatment be performed within a few hours of the injury, though damaged bones remain viable for several days.
