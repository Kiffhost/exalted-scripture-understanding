*The Sidereal knows the scent of fear.*
The Sidereal makes a special (Perception + Brawl) read intentions roll. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every three extra successes
- Is he afraid of me?
- How could I best intimidate him?
- Who here is the most afraid of ?
- What would he face his fears for?
If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
