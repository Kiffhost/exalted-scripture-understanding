*The Abyssal’s words are haunted by shades of subtle meaning meant for a select few.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses one of this Charm’s two techniques: *Insidious Undertone Trick*, which conveys hidden meaning through speech, or *Unwritten Word Apparition*, which does so in writing. Depending on which technique she uses, her speech or writing contains a hidden message that can only be understood by its intended recipients. For writing, she must be familiar with the intended recipients.
Each use of *Insidious Undertone Trick* lets the Abyssal conceal a few simple statements or a single complex statement, while *Unwritten Word Apparition* can conceal a message up to half as long as the document it’s hidden within. Obscured writings can be uncovered by magic like [[Paltry Enigma Dismissal]], but such effects cost an additional [[Willpower]] and have a minimum difficulty of (Abyssal’s [[Linguistics]]).
Effects that are normally unrolled require a ([[Perception]] + [[Linguistics]]) roll.
The Abyssal can repurchase this Charm to learn the second technique.
