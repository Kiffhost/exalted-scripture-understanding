*Gunzosha armor amplifies the strength of its wearer, giving her the strength of ten.*
She adds ([[Strength]]) dice on a [[Strength]]-based roll, or ([[Strength]]) to the raw damage of a withering attack. If she uses this Evocation to enhance a feat of strength, she adds +1 to her effective [[Strength]] to determine what feats she can attempt.
