*A master of herbalism and nature lore, the Dragon-Blood finds all she needs to heal her patients in gardens or the wilderness.*
As long as she has access to medicinal herbs or similar flora, she may roll [[Medicine]] to treat injury, disease, poison, or other afflictions without any increased difficulty for lacking equipment or medication. If she uses medicinal herbs in addition to tools, she treats them as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580), or converts the bonus die from already-exceptional equipment to a non-Charm success.
