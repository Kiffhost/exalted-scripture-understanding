The Lunar is peer to both mendicants and queens, effortlessly insinuating herself into any stratum of society. All observers assume she occupies a specific social role: She might carry herself with the haughty confidence of a prince, swagger with a criminal’s disrepute, humble herself into a semblance of poverty, etc. Any contradiction between her appearance or actions and her presumed social role are overlooked or rationalized away. She may leverage this assumption as though it were a Minor Intimacy, in addition to any other relevant Intimacies characters might have. Rolls to read the Lunar’s intentions or profile her suffer a −([higher of Appearance or Manipulation]/2, rounded up) penalty if they’d reveal contradictory information. Characters who succeed on such a roll realize they were mistaken, but not that the Lunar magically deceived them. 

## Special activation rules

After the first time the Lunar uses this Charm in a day, the Willpower costs of all subsequent activations that day are waived. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as a Manipulation Charm.
