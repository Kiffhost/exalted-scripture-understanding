Reading her foe’s movements through the slight disturbances they create in the air, the Immaculate could dodge his attacks blindfolded. She ignores (Perception/2, rounded up) total points of onslaught penalties or environmental penalties to her Evasion. Additionally, surprise attacks (Exalted, p. 203) inflict no penalty to her Evasion, though she can’t dodge ambushes. In Air Aura, the Immaculate ignores (Perception) points of penalties instead.
