The Exalt touches the weapon to a willing targetâ€™s flesh, letting the purifying flames of [[Burning Branch]] sear through his veins and purge toxins from his system. The character suffers one level of lethal damage from being burnt, but in exchange, poisons that deal [[Initiative]] damage are completely purged from her, while other poisons have their remaining duration halved, rounded down.
