Stirring from its moonsilver slumber, the serpent sealed in the Hundred Rings seizes its prey with killing intent. After succeeding on the [[Initiative]] roll of a grapple gambit, the wielder can use this Evocation. If she succeeds on the control roll, the chain animates and gains its own [[Initiative]], treating the control roll as its [[Join Battle]] roll. It takes control of the grapple, letting her act freely, and ensuring she won’t lose rounds of control if attacked or damaged. 

On its turn, the serpent can only take the standard grapple actions (Exalted, p. 201), using the wielder’s dice pools to do so. She can use the Hundred Rings’ [[Evocations]] through the serpent, including letting it make counterattacks or clashes with [[Scathing Torment Coils]]. It has Parry ([[Strength]] +1), Evasion ([[Wits]] + 1), soak 16, [[Hardness]] 10, and ([[Essence]] + [[Stamina]] + [[Strength]]) −0 health levels. It doesn’t lose rounds of control if attacked or damaged. If its health levels are filled, this Evocation ends, and can’t be used again for the rest of the day. 

## Resonant

Only wielders resonant with the Hundred Rings can awaken this Evocation.
