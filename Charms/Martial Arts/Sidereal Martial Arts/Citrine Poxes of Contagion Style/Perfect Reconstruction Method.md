*Manipulating pressure points and adjusting limbs, the martial artist brings her patient’s body back into alignment with the patterns of his Essence.*
The stylist rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) to heal herself or another willing character, requiring only the briefest of treatments. The difficulty equals the total levels of damage in that patient’s health track, maximum 7. In combat, she can roll her Initiative instead if it’s higher, which doesn’t prevent her from enhancing it with Medicine Charms and similar effects. A successful roll lets her heal one level of non-aggravated damage or convert a level of aggravated damage to lethal. For each extra success, she may pay two motes or one Initiative to heal or convert an additional level of damage.
## Special activation rules
If the stylist knows other Charms that can be used in combat to heal damage or grant temporary health levels to other characters, she may use them reflexively with this Charm, waiving their Willpower costs, to extend their benefits to her target as well. If they require a roll, they use this Charm’s roll instead. The stylist likewise waives the Willpower cost of Charms like Instant Treatment Methodology that let her use such Charms in combat.
