Understanding herself, her tools, and her design with transcendent clarity, the Lunar exceeds her own limits. When adding a full Excellency on a Craft roll with any Attribute, she doubles 9s. An Intelligence 3, Essence 2 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a two-gold-point, one-Willpower surcharge to double 8s. An Intelligence 5, Essence 4 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a two-white-point, one-Willpower surcharge to double 7s.
