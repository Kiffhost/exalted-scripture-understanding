*No god can bring himself to ignore a prayer spoken before an altar or idol crafted with [[Godcarver]].*
The wielder can use this Evocation when she listens to someone pray in or before an idol, shrine, altar, or temple for a god that she’s created with [[Godcarver]]. That god hears the supplicant’s words and counts as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of gratitude toward him if he makes an influence roll through the prayer. This [[Intimacy]] doesn’t apply to gods with negative Ties to him, but with an appropriate offering, those Ties may be treated as one step weaker. The god may choose to answer the prayer in person, manifesting within a depiction of themself or an immaterial apparition within a holy place, letting them speak and otherwise interact with others there for the scene. They can’t take physical actions or use magic through this projection. 
## Resonant
A god can use a single Charm through their manifestation. Its minimum [[Essence]] can’t exceed the wielder’s.
