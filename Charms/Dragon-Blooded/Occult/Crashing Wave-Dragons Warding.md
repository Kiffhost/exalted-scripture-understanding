*Blessing a body of running water with her touch, the Dragon-Blood bids it to flow sanctified and pure.*
Performing the consecration takes one minute. If the body of water is no more than a single range band wide, this effect extends ([[Essence]] x2) range bands downstream in a direction of her choice. If it’s wider than that, the effect extends ([[Essence]]) range bands. Any demon, undead, or fae that enters the water suffers its wrath in the form of dragon-shaped waves, an environmental hazard with difficulty 5 and Damage ([[Essence]])B/ round. They also suffer a −3 penalty on physical actions as long as they touch the water, on top of any penalties crossing normally involves. Withering attacks directed at these creatures deal an additional level of [[Initiative]] damage. A character whose [[Essence]] exceeds the Exalt’s may spend one [[Willpower]] as a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried to best the wave-dragons in a dramatic display of its supernatural prowess, freeing it (but not other characters) from this Charm’s effects for the remainder of its duration. This counts as both its attack and movement for that round. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by successfully advancing a personal goal or one of the Hearth’s group goals by defeating or overcoming a significant demon, fae, or undead in combat or in another milieu, such as intrigue or a contest of riddles.
