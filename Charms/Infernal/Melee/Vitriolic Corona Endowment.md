*Green light falls upon the Infernal’s weapon from distant skies as she raises it in salute, burning her hands as emerald incandescence superheats her blade.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must be at bonfire anima. She superheats a weapon with emerald flame, granting her the following benefits with it:
- She adds an automatic success on withering and decisive damage rolls.
- She rolls an additional (Essence) dice of damage when she uses [[Green Sun Nimbus Flare]].
- She reduces surcharges for [[Green Sun Nimbus Flare]]’s [[Keys]] by one mote or one Initiative each.
- She adds (Strength) to the difficulty of gambits to disarm the weapon. An enemy who attempts to do so from close range suffers (Essence) dice of lethal damage, which ignore Hardness, regardless of whether he succeeds or fails. Mundane weapons used for the gambit are destroyed if [[Rebuking Impudent Arms]] would be capable of doing so.

Mundane weapons enchanted with this Charm are destroyed when it ends, reduced to acrid ash and molten slag.
