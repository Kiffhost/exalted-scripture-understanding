The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s performance revives those who hear it, like the coming of an early spring. All characters who witness her performance add a bonus success on rolls against poison, disease, and other maladies, and multiply the rate at which they heal damage (Exalted, p. 173) by (Essence + [Charisma or Appearance]). The Dragon-Blood can take other actions while continuing the performance by flurrying them with a miscellaneous action to continue performing.
