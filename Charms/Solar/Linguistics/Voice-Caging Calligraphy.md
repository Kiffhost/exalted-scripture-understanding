The Solar binds her words with Essence, folding language into form so winding and deep that all meaning falls into the abyss. This Charm may be used to supplement the writing of letters or other brief works. The information contained in such writing cannot be repeated. The reader momentarily loses his ability to process or remember the contents of the message if he tries to speak it aloud or write it down. Any attempt by the reader to communicate what he knows is rendered useless unless he sees an action occurring in which a Defining Intimacy is threatened by withholding what he knows. Only then may the reader pay (Solarâ€™s current Essence rating) Willpower to shake off the effects of this Charm.
