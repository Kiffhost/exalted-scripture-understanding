A hair’s breadth from the blade’s edge, the Exalt fades from harm. Only her anima is struck. When hit with a decisive attack, the Solar may use this Charm if the attacker rolls a combined total of six 1s and 2s across her attack and damage rolls. Roll the Solar’s ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) against her attacker’s ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]). If she succeeds, she slips out of sight and into concealment, evading the attack as if she had dodged it. If she succeeds with at least one 10 in her result, she enters stealth while her opponent strikes an afterimage left by the Solar’s anima, transferring the damage result harmlessly away from the Solar and returning her opponent to base [[Initiative]]. The Solar may leave an object concealed within her anima to receive the strike, reducing the Charm cost by one mote—two if the player makes a clever substitution. At [[Essence]] 5+, forcing an attacker down to base [[Initiative]] with this Charm nets the Solar a temporary point of [[Willpower]].
