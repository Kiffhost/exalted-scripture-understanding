Even the mightiest blows rebound from the Lunarâ€™s flesh. After an attack hits her or she fails to resist an environmental hazard or trap, before damage is rolled, she may use this Charm for two motes against a withering attack, or five motes against decisive damage. Damageroll 1s subtract successes. If an attack deals no damage, the Lunar steals one Initiative from her attacker (after he resets to base Initiative, if it was decisive).
