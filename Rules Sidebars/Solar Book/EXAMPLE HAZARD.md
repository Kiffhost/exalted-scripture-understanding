The Mirror Court is a maze of mirrors left behind by the Wyld’s retreat. Ships that sail into the Mirror Court are almost inevitably lost forever. Each round of sailing through the Mirror Court is made at difficulty 5. Each time the player fails a roll, the ship’s crew—possibly disoriented by hundreds of reflections—steers into one of the mirrors, causing the ship to impact with its reflection exactly as if having been struck with the ram maneuver on page 245. Other hazards exist in the Mirror Court. [[Safe Bearing Technique]] vastly reduces the threat of these and any other hazards the Solar has bested.
