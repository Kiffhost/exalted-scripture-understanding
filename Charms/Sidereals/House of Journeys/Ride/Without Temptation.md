With a firm touch on the strands of fate, the Sidereal frees those in her service from the possibility of disobedience. The Sidereal’s familiars, characters affected by Breaking the Wild Mortal, and characters with positive Major or Defining Ties to the Sidereal may treat influence as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220) if it would create or strengthen a negative Tie to her, weaken a positive Tie to her, or cause them to act against her best interests. If an influence roll opposes one of the Sidereal’s Intimacies related to her agendas or ambitions, the character must treat it as unacceptable. Likewise, they can’t take actions that oppose or threaten such Intimacies. Affected characters can’t voluntarily weaken positive Ties to the Sidereal unless they pay three Willpower each time they do so.
