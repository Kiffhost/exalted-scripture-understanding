Striking with icy fury, the [[Frost-Thorn Knuckles]] freeze their victim’s blood into crimson razors slashing him from within. [[Blood-Freezing Strike]] is a decisive attack that can only be made against a prone enemy, adding ([[Strength]]) damage dice. Additionally, the victim loses 1 [[Initiative]] for each 10 on the decisive damage roll. The wielder doesn’t gain this [[Initiative]]. An enemy crashed by this [[Initiative]] lossisfrozeninplace,unabletotakeanymovementactions except to rise from prone until he recovers from crash. 

## Special activation rules

A character who isn’t dissonant with moonsilver may awaken this Evocation at no cost when she hunts and kills a man-eating predator, giant beast, or other monster that poses a danger to nearby civilization. 

## Resonant

This attack strips away [[Initiative]] equal to the total levels of damage dealt, instead of just the 10s on the damage roll.
