This white stone is speckled red, gold, and black. Mounted in an attuned hearthstone socket, it wards off spiritual possession, allowing the bearer to reject any such invasion of body or soul by spending one Willpower. Thus mounted, it also grants the opportunity to awaken the following Evocation:
Spirit-Evicting Strike Cost: 5m, 1wp; Mins: Essence 2
Type: Simple
Keywords: Decisive-only
Duration: Instant
Prerequisites: None
The jewel’s power can free another of possession with a gambit made using a weapon the hearthstone is socketed in, with difficulty equal to the possessing spirit’s (Essence). Success ejects the possessor and stuns it momentarily, inflicting a −3 penalty on all its dice pools until the bearer’s next turn.
