In the oldest legends, the first night came to Creation wrapped around Luna’s shoulders, spreading from horizon to horizon like a cloak unfolding. Many among the Old Realm’s savants considered this cloak of night an allegory or a metaphor, but not Ashla Hidden-Key.
Captivated by the myth, the young sorcerer offered up prayers and sacrifices to Luna, petitioning the Incarna for but a single thread of their cloak of night. When no answer came, Ashla found herself a laughingstock among her peers, the subject of endless jests and satires.
But the Lunar was unmoved. She confronted those who mocked her on the floor of the Deliberative, rebuking them with righteous fury. It was only then that a moonbeam lit her, as the Deliberative’s ceiling became the night sky, and a skein of night fell into her hands.
From Luna’s gift, Ashla wove her own cloak. She kept her workshop in utter darkness as she worked, spinning threads of night on a wheel of raksha-bone and working the moonsilver of the cloak’s stitching and clasp. Clad in her mantle of midnight, the sorcerer forced even the most bitter of her rivals in the Deliberative to acknowledge her prowess and achievements, beguiling the Old Realm’s foes and binding them with Lunar witchcraft. It has been passed down to many Lunar sorcerers since her, entrusted only to those deemed worthy to guard a sacred relic of Luna.
The [[Cloak of Forgotten Midnights]] seems cut from the night sky, lit by countless stars. Strange constellations come into view when the hooded cloak’s wearer casts [[sorcery]] or calls on otherworldly forces. The cloak’s moonsilver clasp forms a prayer of thanks to Luna in the glyphs of the Old Realm’s tongue when its two halves are fastened. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the Cloak of

Forgotten Midnights The [[Cloak of Forgotten Midnights]] is a sorcerous relic (Exalted, p. 470), letting its wielder initiate into [[sorcery]]. Its [[Evocations]] create and control darkness, and can draw on it as a wellspring of sorcerous power.
The cloak is exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for [[Stealth]] rolls made in darkness and [[Occult]] rolls involving spirits or fae related to darkness, night, or the moon.
As a sorcerous relic, the cloak can be taken at character creation as a sorcerous initiation instead of requiring the [[Artifact]] Merit. It has the following shaping rituals:
Mystical Focus: A sorcerer with a mote pool may commit up to ten additional motes to the cloak after a scene spent interacting with it. When she takes a [[Shape Sorcery]] action, she may release up to ([[Essence]] + 2) of these committed motes to add that many toward the spell. When casting her control spell, each committed mote released contributes two sorcerous motes. This ritual can only be used once per day.
[[Night]]-Witch Arcana: The sorcerer can use this ritual while in darkness that would let her make a [[Stealth]] roll to enter concealment. Once per scene, when she takes a [[Shape Sorcery]] action in such conditions, she gains an additional ([[Essence]]) motes. (She doesn’t need to be in concealment). If she has established concealment in the darkness, she’s not limited to once per scene, as long as any targets her spell has are unaware of her.
Sorcerer’s Mantle: Once per scene, when the sorcerer stunts a [[Shape Sorcery]] roll by describing how she draws power from the cloak, she gains an additional (stunt + 2) sorcerous motes. She’s not limited to once per scene when casting her control spell.
