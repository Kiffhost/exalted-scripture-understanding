At first, hemorrhagic fever might seem like nothing more than a sudden flu, causing fever, nausea, and chest pains. Soon, though, the disease spreads throughout the body, causing internal bleeding and massive hemorrhaging that soon lead to an agonizing death. Blood pours out of almost every orifice, and every droplet is a potential vector for new infection.
