*The martial artist is as death herself, her blade offering a final release to those whose time has come.*
The stylist may pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Violet Bier of Sorrows Form to gain the following additional benefits: 
- Her withering attacks add (Strength) Overwhelming. 
- When she crashes an enemy, his wound penalty is doubled until he leaves crash. 
- When she lands a decisive attack that resets her Initiative, she adds her enemy’s wound penalty to her base Initiative. 
- Incapacitating a nontrivial enemy awards her one Willpower.
