*Having concluded a murder investigation and identified the culprit to her own complete certainty, the Solar hurls [[Black Wind]] into the sky.*
If the culprit is within 10 miles, the [[skycutter]] will attempt to strike him down. If the target is a trivial opponent and outdoors, the [[skycutter]] likely returns bearing some blood blades and the criminal’s severed body parts (generally including the head) in its wake. If it fails to kill with its single attack, it either returns with only blood blades and perhaps a severed limb, or empty-handed. If the target is well-guarded, indoors, or otherwise inaccessible, the [[skycutter]] returns bearing some evidence of his location—green roof tiles struck from a building, a signpost ripped off a teahouse, a branch severed from a cherry tree, or the like. This is largely a matter of narrative and need not be rolled. If a player or very important Storyteller character is the target of this Evocation, treat Black Wind’s strike as a decisive surprise attack following a standard [[Join Battle]] roll. At [[Essence]] 5+, if the Solar knows her target to be a powerful supernatural being, hidden behind sturdy fortifications, or well-guarded against her attack, the Solar may draw out the souls of all 100 murderers within the [[skycutter]] as she hurls it into the air. These manifest as 100 blood blades screaming in Black Wind’s wake like a dark comet scarring the sky. The blades expend themselves smashing down walls and ceilings, cutting down defenders, and otherwise clearing a path for the [[skycutter]] and whatever blades remain to destroy the murderer. Treat this as a decisive ambush attack following a [[Join Battle]] roll based on ([[Dexterity]] + {Awareness or Thrown}) and enjoying double 7s. The Solar must slay 100 murderers with [[Black Wind]] before she can use this ultimate form of [[Soul-Reaving Release]] again (this can’t be quickened with the [[Dawn]] anima power). 

## Special activation rules

Rather than being bought with experience, this Evocation awakens after the Solar uses [[Black Wind]] to slay a serial murderer whose killings directly offend or defy one of her Major or Defining Principles, such as murdering someone in a land she has sworn to protect, or sowing fear in a land where the Solar has sworn that she will be the only object of fear. It can only be activated at the definitive conclusion of a successful investigation.
