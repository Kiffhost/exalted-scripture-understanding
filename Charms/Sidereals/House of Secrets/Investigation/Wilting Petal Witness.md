Digging into the earth with her bare hands, the Sidereal calls forth a witness to the deceits of the wicked. The Sidereal bids a green chrysanthemum bloom. It won’t deteriorate with time, even if plucked. If a narratively relevant lie is spoken in its presence, it withers and dies, warning the Sidereal. Against magic capable of contesting this, she rolls (Perception + Investigation) opposing that Charm’s roll. If she fails, the flower doesn’t die.
