Youngest Son’s Inheritance Striding the battlefield and the courts of the Blessed Isle alike with noble bearing, Imprimatur’s master awakens the sealed blade. This Evocation can only be activated at Initiative 15+. For the rest of the scene, the Exalt may reflexively spend any amount of Renown to add that many dice to the initiative roll of a decisive attack. Additionally, each time the wielder uses this Evocation, she is given a vision of a unique message etched across the blade in Old Realm, an excerpt of the Empress’s words to the proud inheritor. She may choose one of the following messages to gain the benefit of for this Evocation’s duration as long as Imprimatur has the requisite amount of Renown. 
-  Ambition is a Promise (Renown 3): After winning a clash with a decisive attack, the wielder may expend all Renown and roll that many dice of damage, ignoring Hardness, instead of using her Initiative. This doesn’t include her Initiative or reset her to base. 
-  Marriage is a Blade (Renown 5): The wielder may reflexively spend a point of Renown to share Imprimatur’s power with an ally, letting him use all its Evocations whose Essence minimums he meets, other than this one, with one weapon of his choice until the scene ends. She pays any Renown costs, and any Renown he’d gain is instead granted to her. 
-  A Dragon is Born (Renown 7): The wielder may make a special disarm gambit that resets an Exalt’s anima banner to dim or cancels a Dragon-Blood’s Elemental Aura. The wielder may choose to add the stolen levels of anima to her own banner or enter the stolen Aura. Upon awakening this Evocation, the Storyteller and the wielder’s player may work together to create a new unique message discovered by the wielder with benefits comparable to the above options. The Final Words of Queens can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Tie to one’s family, be they by blood or by adoption, by accomplishing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170). The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
