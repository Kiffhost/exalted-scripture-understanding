The Dragon-Blood urges her steed skywards in a leap that defiesgravity.Shemayhavehermountautomaticallyjump one range band forward horizontally with her reflexive movement for the turn. Alternatively, when she has her mount jump as part of a movement roll, including rushing and disengaging, every 10 rerolls a non-1 failed die. In Air Aura, her steed may leap one range band vertically, as long as the steed can land on a surface capable of bearing its weight.
