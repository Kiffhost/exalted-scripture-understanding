*Prehistoric memories roll through the deathknight’s mind, insights gleaned from the nightmares of slain titans. Each memory of defeat urges her onward.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a battle group acting on her order action successfully hits an enemy battle group with an attack. The attack deals no damage, but the Abyssal can either enact a stratagem or negate an enemy general’s stratagem as long as its threshold is less than or equal to the attack roll’s extra successes.
The Abyssal can have up to ([[Essence]]) stratagems simultaneously from repeat uses of this Charm in the same scene.
