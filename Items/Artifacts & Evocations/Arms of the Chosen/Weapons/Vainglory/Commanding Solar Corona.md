*When worn, [[Vainglory]] mantles its wearer with a nimbus of ancient power.*
This Evocation enhances the following [[Charms]] as described below: 
- While [[Majestic Radiant Presence]] (Exalted, p. 370) is active, crashing an enemy for the first time this scene forces him to pay the Charm’s Willpower cost again before speaking to her or attacking, even if he’s already paid it before. 
- [[Enemy-Castigating Solar Judgment]] (Exalted, p. 371) treats characters for whom the Solar has a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of hatred as creatures of darkness. 
- Bonus dice provided by Vainglory’s innate power become automatic successes when applied to threaten actions generated by [[Terrifying Apparition of Glory]] (Exalted, p. 371).
