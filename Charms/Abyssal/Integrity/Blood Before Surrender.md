*Blood trickles from the Abyssal’s lips as she pushes herself to her utmost, burning away her own deathless vitality to sustain her resolve.*
When the Abyssal’s [[Resolve]] is beaten by an influence roll to convince her to undertake a serious or lifechanging task (Exalted, p. 216), she can use this Charm to perfectly defend against that influence.
## Reset 
Once per story, unless reset when events prove the Abyssal justified in refusing the influence in a way that benefits or aligns with death’s chivalry or one of her one of her Defining Principles.
