*This pair of deadly weapons is a set of razor-sharp [[tiger claws]] that strap onto the wearer’s hands.*
Razor claws always come in pairs and consist of fingerless leather gloves fitted with three slightly curved blades extending three or more inches beyond the wearer’s knuckles. In addition to causing horrific rending wounds, these claws also add two dice to all climbing rolls made by the wearer.
Wearers can retract the claws, transforming this weapon into a pair of heavy fingerless gloves.
