The Lunar’s limbs fly with superhuman speed, raining down blows on those who oppose her. She makes up to ([[Essence]] + 1) decisive attacks, maximum five, against one ormoreenemies.Shedoesn’tneedtousethesameAbility for all attacks, and may reflexively change weapons between attacks. Her [[Initiative]] is divided evenly among all attacks, rounded up, and doesn’t reset until the final attack is completed, assuming at least one hit. She doesn’t lose [[Initiative]] for missed attacks unless all of them miss. 
## Protean 

In shapes with more than four limbs, each successful attack adds one die to the damage of all subsequent attacks. The bonus from multiple successful attacks stacks.
