*Ever-efficient in her craft, the Abyssal necrosurgeon swiftly stitches together hordes of shambling monstrosities.*
The Abyssal can pay a five-mote surcharge when she uses [[Life-Mocking Assembly]] or [[Necrotic Graft Technique]], letting her apply those Charms’ benefits to up to ([[Essence]] x5) animated corpses over the course of a day.
