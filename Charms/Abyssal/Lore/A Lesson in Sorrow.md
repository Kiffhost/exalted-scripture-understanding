*There is no hope in the truths pronounced by Death’s Lawgivers, only the promise of inevitable despair.*
When the Abyssal successfully [[Introducing a Fact|introduces a fact]] and speaks it aloud, her roll also counts as an [[inspire]] roll to spread a negative emotion, as long as it’s appropriate to the introduced fact’s impact on her audience.
For the rest of the scene, affected characters suffer a −2 penalty on rolls or a −1 penalty on static values when they take an action that’s opposed to the inspired emotion.
With a [[Lore]] 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can instead treat her roll as an [[instill]] roll to create or strengthen negative [[Intimacy#|Intimacies]]. This Charm’s penalty applies to actions that oppose that [[Intimacy]].
[[Whispers]]: The Abyssal may invoke her [[Whispers]] to inflict −2 [[Resolve]] against her influence. Mortals and [[Essence]] 1 ghosts with [[Willpower]] less than or equal to her [[Essence]] are automatically affected and can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist, as are trivial characters.
