This Torment imposes an emotional effect on those exposed to it as a Psyche effect, compelling them to adore the Infernal, succumb to mindless rage, sink into crushing despair, etc. The Infernal chooses an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) pool and a specific emotion she wishes to inspire. When a target is subject to her Torment, she can make an inspire roll with this pool. Affected characters suffer a −3 penalty on all rolls that aren’t in accordance with the imposed emotion. Even if a character spends Willpower to resist, he’s affected by this influence until the end of his next turn. This influence doesn’t need to be reset before using it again if it fails.
