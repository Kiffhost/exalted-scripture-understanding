This Torment works like Overwhelming Passion, but compels victims to take a specific course of action: kneeling, turning on their allies, revealing their secrets. This is rolled as either a persuade or threaten action. Trivial characters and First Circle demons automatically succumb to the effect. The Infernal chooses what course of action she can compel and whether it’s a persuade or threaten roll when she purchases this power.
