The Dragon-Blood buries a written message in the soil and suffuses it with Wood Essence, bidding it to grow and blossom into a small but colorful flower. The arrangement of petals and leaves on the flower acts as a cipher created with Cryptic Essence Cipher, conveying the contents of the message, which can be up to one page.
The Dragon-Blood rolls ([Intelligence or Manipulation] + Linguistics), doubling 9s, to determine the strength of the cipher, but few realize the code is there to be broken — the plant cannot be distinguished from ordinary flowers except by actions enhanced with magic. However, to the intended recipient of the flower, it’s immediately recognizable that the plant contains a message.
