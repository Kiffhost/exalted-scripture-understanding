If an artifact’s [[Evocations]] are born in large part from their wielder’s legend and their deeds together, how does this manifest mechanically for a newly crafted artifact? Typically, a brand-new artifact weapon or armor will start with a few [[Essence]] 1-2 [[Evocations]] rooted in the artisan’s intent, as agreed upon by the Storyteller and the artisan’s player. As the wielder’s legend develops and she gains experience, her player may work with the Storyteller to design new [[Evocations]] one at a time, each one fitted to the character’s heroic deeds with the weapon and her role in the ongoing story.
