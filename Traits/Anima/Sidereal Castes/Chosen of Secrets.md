Oldest and most mysterious of her sisters, Jupiter knows much and speaks little. She presides over mystery and revelation, truth and falsehood, ignorance and understanding, and the lines between them. Her Chosen ensure that all things are hidden or revealed as destiny demands, thwarting seekers after forbidden knowledge or wresting secrets whose time has come from their keepers. They are savants and spies, mystics and masterminds, distinguished by their foresight even among their Sidereal peers. In Heaven’s name, they’ve put great libraries to the torch, deposed monarchs to expose their secret sins, and sought out long-forgotten lore from demons, ghosts, and worse.

The First Age’s Oracles explored the mysteries of the unknown cosmos, infiltrated the courts of Creation’s enemies, investigated crimes committed by or against the Chosen, and oversaw great libraries and academies fit for a glorious age. At the same time, they sealed away baleful remnants of the world’s makers, censored dangerous secrets from discovery by their fellow Exalted, and kept knowledge of Creation’s vulnerabilities from the world’s foes. Their foresight guided the Old Realm through many trials, from the akuma Canticle Shrike’s blighting of the omphalos to the Skyeater Moth’s emergence from the Wyld beneath the world’s depths. 

Much knowledge has been lost to the Second Age that Heaven’s Eyes may yet reveal when destiny demands it, while some secrets of the Old Realm must be kept hidden until the stars are right. Contemporary secrets also demand their attention. Oracles warn princes of what the future holds for them, blackmail the truculent back onto their destined course, and set in motion long chains of events with strategic disclosures of information. They also strive to conceal conspiracies, secret societies, and mystery cults, either in fulfillment of destiny or as assets they might later call upon. 

Destined Oracles’ mortal lives are touched by mystery. Some were driven by unanswered questions: foundlings seeking after their lineage, students of spiritual mysteries, savants obsessed with unsolveable problems. Others had secrets of their own: a criminal past, romantic infidelity, treasonous ambitions, or knowledge too dangerous to share. Some led lives of constant deception: spies, charlatans, thieves, cardsharps, and priests entrusted with mysteries of the divine. Some have a taciturn predisposition, but there are just as many Oracles who’d never stop talking if they could.

# Auspicious Prospects
## Auspicious Prospects for Secrets

The Oracles may pay one mote to learn whether concealing or revealing a piece of information would align with destiny. 

## Lesser Sign of Jupiter

The Oracle may pay five motes to reflexively make Jupiter’s lesser sign, drawing it in emerald stardust. Until her next turn, she and allies within close range gain +1 non-Charm [[Guile]] and add (her [[Essence]], maximum 5) non-Charm dice on [[Manipulation]], [[Larceny]], and [[Stealth]] rolls. 

## Greater Sign of Jupiter

Once per story, the Oracle may pay twenty motes and one [[Willpower]] to reflexively make Jupiter’s greater sign, traced across the sky in emerald radiance. She, her allies, and up to ([[Essence]] x2) other characters are immune to effects opposing their [[Guile]] and add (her [[Essence]]) to their [[Resolve]]. Un-Exalted characters can’t lie to them or refuse to answer their questions they unless they spend one [[Willpower]] per lie or refusal; characters with [[Essence]] less than the Sidereal’s can’t resist. This lasts one scene. Additionally, for that scene and the next ([[Essence]]) days, [[Investigation]] rolls against the blessed characters fail automatically and they’re immune to magic that would scry on them or divine their future.
