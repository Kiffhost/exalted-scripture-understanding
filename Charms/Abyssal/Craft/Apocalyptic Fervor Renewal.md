*Sworn to the world’s destruction, the Abyssal hastens its final day with her dark creations.*
The Abyssal adds the following “advanced” objective to the basic objectives for gaining craft points (Exalted, p. 240). Each advanced objective she achieves grants an additional two silver points for a basic project or one gold point for others.
 - If another character gains or strengthens a Tie toward her, she gains extra points if it’s a negative Tie or a Tie of awe, desire, or obsession.
- If the project provides a benefit to her, she gains extra points if it will aid in serving death’s chivalry.
- If the project supports one of her Intimacies, she gains extra points if that Intimacy is a negative Tie, a positive Tie to one of the dead, or a Principle involving death.
This Charm is compatible with effects like Entropic Crucible Understanding that let non-Craft actions trigger project awards.
