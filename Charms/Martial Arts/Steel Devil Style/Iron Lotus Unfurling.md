This Charm is modeled as a disarm gambit (p. 199) with double 9s on the Initiative roll. If it succeeds, the Exalt may paythreemotestounleashapointblankSonicSlash,adding two automatic successes to the attack roll and (Essence) damage dice to the attack’s base damage. The Exalt must know the Sonic Slash Charm to use this attack.
