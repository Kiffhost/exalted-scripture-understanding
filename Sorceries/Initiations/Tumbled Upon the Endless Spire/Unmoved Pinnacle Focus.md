Once per scene, when the sorcerer successfully defends against influence that would weaken one of her Intimacies — whether by applying Resolve, spending Willpower, or other means) — she gains (Integrity) sorcerous motes, which last until the scene ends. If she spends these sorcerous motes on a spell that align with the Intimacy she asserted, she adds (Integrity) dice to her Shape Sorcery roll. Examples include using a spell to harm a character the sorcerer has a negative Tie toward or a spell that manifests jewels for a Principle expressing on a love of beauty.
