*With an agonizing wrench of her scythe, Huskflayer’s master rips away flesh as painfully as possible.*
If Huskflayer’s wielder reaps gore points from an attack, she inflicts a −1 crippling penalty on her victim’s rolls and to his effective [[Initiative]] for determining when he acts for the rest of the scene. When she attacks him, she adds this penalty to her banked gore points, maximum 10, to determine Huskflayer’s damage bonus and the effects of its [[Evocations]].
With [[Insatiable Scythe Hunger]], the penalty inflicted increases to −1 for every two points reaped, rounded up.
## Resonant
The penalty inflicted is increased by one.
