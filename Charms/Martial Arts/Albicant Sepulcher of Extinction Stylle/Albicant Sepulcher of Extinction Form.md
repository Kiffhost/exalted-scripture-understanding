*The bleak saint entombs herself in enlightenment.*
The stylist gains the following benefits:
 - While she stands still, slabs of funereal marble rise up from the earth to surround her, as if entombing her alive. At the end of each of her turns, she gains light [[cover]] from these, or upgrades existing cover to heavy. She doesn’t gain this benefit if she’s taken a [[movement]] action that round, and the cover shatters if she takes a movement action or is forcibly moved or knocked [[prone]]. If the stylist is incapacitated, she is interred within this sepulcher, granting her unconscious form full cover for the rest of the scene.i
 - When she incapacitates a nontrivial enemy or empties a battle group’s [[Magnitude track]], the world itself is wounded. For the rest of the scene, blood rains down out to medium range from where she made the attack. The rain inflicts a −1 penalty on rolls when its interference with a character’s senses disadvantages him, or −3 for scent-based rolls. Those within the rain also suffer −1 Resolve against fear-based [[influence]]. She can only have one blood storm at a time.
 - When she successfully defends against an attack, she can reflexively use [[Let Every Chain Be Broken]] or [[Rejoice! The Abattoir Awaits]] to make a counterattack.
## Special activation rules
Upon successfully defending against an attack that misses by at least two successes, the stylist may reflexively enter this Form, letting her counterattack as above.
