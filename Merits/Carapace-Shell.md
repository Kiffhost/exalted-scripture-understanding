### Prerequisite
Unusual Hide ••
The mutant has bulky armor of bone or chitin, a turtle’s shell, or pangolin-like armored plates. Soak from Unusual Hide is doubled but counts as armored soak.
It explicitly stacks with soak from worn armor. She gains (Unusual Hide) Hardness.

### Drawback
The mutant counts as wearing medium armor, and suffers a −1 mobility penalty in addition to any from other armor.
