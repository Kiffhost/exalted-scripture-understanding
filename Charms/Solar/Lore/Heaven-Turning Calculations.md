This Charm is special, in that it requires the Solar’s [[Lore]] rating to reflect a background of intense mathematic study.
With this Charm, the Exalt’s study of number theory and proofs unlocks her ability to approach complex problems mathematically. Add ([[Essence]]) non-Charm bonus dice to her [[Craft]], spell effects, and speculative [[Bureaucracy]] rolls, to [[Lore]] rolls which require logic or mathematics, and to any use of [[Wyld-Shaping Technique]].
