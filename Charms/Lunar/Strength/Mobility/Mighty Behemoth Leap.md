The pillars of the world shake as the Lunar bounds through the heavens. To use this Charm, she can’t be within close range of any enemies, unless they’re crashed or trivial. She jumps up to (Essence/2, rounded up) range bands vertically or horizontally, suffering no falling damage. She can’t jump fewer than two range bands. Enemies within close range of her when she leaps are knocked prone; when she lands, she rolls (Strength + Athletics) opposing the (Dexterity + Dodge) rolls of all enemies within close range, knocking those who fail prone. Upon landing, the Lunar can reflexively make a decisive attack against an enemy within close range. If he was knocked prone by her landing, she adds dice to the damage roll equal to the number of successes he failed by. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Leaping Pounce, the Lunar’s attack is unblockable.
