The storm demon Akavadra was among the mightiest enemies that the Exalted faced in the Divine Revolution. The demon trampled armies beneath dancing feet of lightning, cast great winds to scuttle the armadas of the gods, and slew even the Chosen with her spear of lightning. In the end, it took a saint to defeat the devil. Stone Leaf Kon walked through Akavadra’s storms unscathed, made untouchable to the demon’s fury by virtue of his pure heart. He could not strike her down — for he had sworn an oath against killing — but instead bound her in a sealing circle, and began to speak. Though he could not win the demon to his own ethics, he convinced her to consent to being bound away in a daiklave, so that she might witness the deeds of heroes across the ages and finally make up her mind. Broken Thunder, the [[Twilight]] of Kon’s Circle, folded layers after countless layers of orichalcum around Akavadra’s demonic [[Essence]], perfecting the internal geometries of the weapon’s composition to seal away the devil. The blade was slender, an elegant and curving sword, but its weight is far greater than it should be even in an attuned master’s hands — the spiritual pressure of Akavadra’s malice. To abate this, Broken Thunder forged a scabbard of white jade to contain [[Stormcaller]] and ground its power. Even so, the blade must be purified with rice wine at each new moon to keep the storm demon’s wrath at bay. Stone Leaf Kon never drew [[Stormcaller]] from its sheath. Instead, he passed it onto the young reincarnation of his Circle’s [[Dawn]], Rusal Ji, hoping that both hero and demon mightlearnfromeachother.Youngandimpetuous,Rusal became a favorite of Akavadra, unleashing her lightning indiscriminately to satisfy his own rage. He burned the sacred grove of Jupiter to the ground to roust an enemy of the gods that had taken shelter there, cut down the legions of two nations in a single battle to win a passing fancy’s heart, and drove the six-eyed mystics of the Karsi tribe to extinction to satisfy his anger after being rejected. He died at the hands of his own Circle’s [[Night]], who could no longer stand these atrocities. Heartbrokenandguilty,StoneLeafKonsealedStormcaller away, locking it inside a one-ton puzzlebox of white jade that’s buried in a dungeon filled with death traps, sorcerous wardings, and bound demons. Though the [[Sidereal Exalted]] searched frantically for the daiklave in their preparations for the Usurpation, they never found its hiding place. They keep a watchful eye out for any sign of the seal being broken and [[Stormcaller]] returning to the world. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Stormcaller]]

An Exalt attuned to [[Stormcaller]] is immune to environmental penalties from wind, precipitation, and other weather. In addition, only an attuned wielder is capable of drawing [[Stormcaller]] from its scabbard. Within seconds, the sky grows dark, the wind picks up, and rain begins to fall out to four range bands from [[Stormcaller]]. The storm’s Intensitybeginsat0andrisesbyonewheneverthewielder landsadecisiveattackwithStormcallerwhileatInitiative 15+. Its other [[Evocations]] can also generate Intensity. A wielder who isn’t resonant with orichalcum cannot raise the storm’s Intensity above (her [[Essence]] + 3), while a dissonant wielder can’t raise it above (her [[Essence]]). Intensity Storm Effects 0 Weak rainstorms. −1 on all sight- and vision-based rolls and ranged attacks. 1-3 Heavy rainfall. −2 on all sight- and vision-based rolls and ranged attacks. 4-6 Downpour. −3 penalty on all actions, and all ground is considered difficult terrain. 7-9 Gale-force winds. As above, and aerial creatures treat flying through the air as harsh terrain. 10+ Hurricane-force winds. As above, but flight is impossible. Sheathing [[Stormcaller]] causes the tempest to disperse in one final blast of lightning, resetting its Intensity. This is a special unblockable decisive attack rolled with a free full Excellency against all characters within one range band of the wielder per point of Intensity, to a maximum of ([[Essence]] + 3) range bands. This doesn’t spare her allies. The attack has a damage equal to the storm’s (Intensity x3), which is divided evenly among all characters hit (round up) to determine the base damage rolled against them, ignoring [[Hardness]]. No [[Initiative]] is needed and no damage roll is made for trivial opponents or battle groups, who instead take (Intensity) levels of damage. The wielder’s [[Initiative]] isn’t included in the damage or reset to base by it, nor can she use [[Charms]] or other magic to enhance the blast. Each new moon, [[Stormcaller]] must be ritually cleansed with rice wine to keep the bound demon at bay. To perform the purification, the wielder must have [[Occult]] 3+, or [[Occult]] 1+ and a demon-related specialty. The ritual is a ([Charisma or Intelligence] + [[Occult]]) roll at difficulty 4 that takes a scene to complete. Performing the purification successfully tempers the storm devil’s fury — when the wielder sheathes a purified [[Stormcaller]], the resulting devastation won’t harm her allies or any character she has a positive Tie towards.
