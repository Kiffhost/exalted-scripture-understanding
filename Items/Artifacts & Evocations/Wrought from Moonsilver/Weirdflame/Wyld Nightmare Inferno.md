Raising Weirdflame skyward, the wielder unleashes a Wyld-fire vortex, engulfing the world around her in chaos. This is a difficulty (Essence), Damage 4L/round environmental hazard extending out to medium range from her. Rolls against it use the lower of the appropriate (Attribute + Ability) pool or (Wits + Integrity). If Spark of Madness is active, the wielder is immune to this hazard. Each level of damage a character takes from the hazard lowers the difficulty of Wyld-Flame Crucible’s gambits against him by one. Once the difficulty’s been lowered to 0, each subsequent time a character takes damage, the wielder may afflict him with one of Wyld-Flame Crucible’s transformations. This blaze can’t be extinguished by water, or even fire-suppressing magic, but it ends if the wielder is crashed.
## Resonant

Only a wielder resonant with Weirdflame can awaken this Evocation.
