*With binding [[Essence]], the Lawgiver makes her ship as tireless and unstoppable as she is.*
This Charm is triggered in response to an attack or impact that would destroy her vessel. [[Ship-Sustaining Spirit]] holds the ship together as long as the Solar remains on board and keeps the [[Essence]] committed. If the ship takes even one level of damage, it will fall apart, although the Exalt may continue to send her [[Essence]] spearing through the shipâ€™s frame to hold it together, maintaining multiple commitments to the Charm.
