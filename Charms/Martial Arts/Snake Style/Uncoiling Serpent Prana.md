Striking a menacing blow in the direction of a distant enemy, the martial artist sends a serpentine ribbon of anima flashing towards him, bearing her wrath on its fangs. Uncoiling Serpent Prana can be used to attack an enemy with lower Initiative out to short range with a withering or decisive attack. If this deals 5+ Initiative damage or any decisive damage, the martial artist may drag that enemy into close range with her, twisting the ribbon of Essence to coil around him and draw him in. While Essence Fangs and Scales Technique is active, the range of this Charm is extended to medium. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood does not enjoy any additional benefit when Essence Fangs and Scales Technique is active.
