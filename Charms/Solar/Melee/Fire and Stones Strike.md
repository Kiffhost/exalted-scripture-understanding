The Solar strikes with telling force, burning [[Essence]] surging into the body of her target and shattering it from within. On a withering attack, the Exalt spends up to her ([[Strength]]) score in motes before making the attack. If the attack hits, each mote spent adds a single die to the postsoak damage of the attack. This strike has the potential to increase minimum damage (p. 184). On a decisive attack, the Exalt may spend up to ([[Essence]] or three, whichever is greater) motes before making the attack to transfer an equal number of extra successes from her attack roll into the raw damage of the blow.
