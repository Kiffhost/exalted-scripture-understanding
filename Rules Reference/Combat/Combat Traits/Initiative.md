Initiative is a very important element of combat. Initiative may be increased by [[Combat Actions#Attack#withering|withering attacks]], and spent on Charms and [[Combat Actions#Attack#decisive|decisive attacks]]. Starting initiative is determined each combat by a [[Join Battle]] roll.

There is no upper or lower limit on Initiative. A character of initiative of 0 or below is in a vulnerable state called [[#Initiative Crash]]. 
[[#Crashing]] an opponent provides an extra boost to a character's initiative, called [[#Break|Initiative Break]].
Finally, [[#Crashing]] an opponent who Crashed you provides a further bonus, called [[#Shift|Initiative Shift]].
# Crash
When a character has 0 or lower initiative, they are in [[#Crash]]. Crashed characters:
- Cannot launch [[Combat Actions#Attack#decisive|decisive attacks]].
- Cannot use Charms with [[Charm Keywords#Perilous]].
- Are considered to have [[Hardness]] 0, regardless of equipment or magic, unless the source of [[Hardness]] explicitly states that it still applies in [[#Crash|Initiative Crash]].

If a character survives three consecutive turns in [[#Crash]], they reset to [[#Base]] initiative at the beginning of their next [[Time#turn|turn]].

[[Combat Actions#Attack#withering|Withering attacks]] continue to affect a Crashed character as normal. However, if the Storyteller decides that a Crashed character has no hope of recovery and is being used as an easy source of initiative, they can declare he Crashed character defeated the next time they suffer a successful [[Combat Actions#Attack#withering|withering attack.]] 

If a character enters [[#Crash]] as a result of their own actions, they immediately lose another 5 initiative. 
## Crashing
The act of lowering an opponent's [[Initiative]] to 0 or less, called [[#Crash|Initiative Crash]].

Forcing an opponent into [[#Crash]] provides an [[#Break|Initiative Break]].
# Break
An [[#Break|Initiative Break]] bonus is a +5 bonus to Initiative, gained by [[#Crashing]] an enemy.

A character cannot gain an [[#Break|Initiative Break]] bonus from an enemy during the round that enemy recovers from [[#Crash]], or during the round that follows that.

If a character forces himself into [[#Crash]] (such as by using a Charm which costs Initiative to activate), then the [[#Break]] bonus is awarded to the opponent most directly responsible for provoking the action which caused the character to [[#Crash]], at the Storyteller’s discretion.
# Shift
Achieved by [[#Crashing]] an enemy who [[#Crash]]ed you.

- If you are currently below your [[#Base|Base Initiative]], [[#Shift]] returns you to [[#Base|Base Initiative]].
- Then, make a [[Join Battle]] roll, adding the result to your initiative.
- Your turn is then refreshed: any combat or movement [[Combat Actions|actions]] you have used that turn are reset, allowing you to act again, immediately; however, should this renewed action be used to [[Combat Actions#Attack|attack]], you can only attack the character you Shifted against.

A character who entered [[#Crash]] as a result of his own actions (such as by using a [[Combat Movement#Disengage|disengage action]]) cannot achieve Initiative [[#Shift]].
# Base
By default, the base initiative value is 3.
# Damage
The result of a [[Combat Actions#withering|withering attack]], initiative damage is the amount the target's initiative is lowered by at the end of the attack. It mostly represents bad positioning, tactical disadvantage, and discomfort—at most it might represent a character getting banged around or scratched.
