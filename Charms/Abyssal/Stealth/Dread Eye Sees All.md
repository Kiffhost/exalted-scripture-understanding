*Witness of Unspoken Shame Stepping forward from the shadows, the Abyssal infiltrator reveals herself at the worst possible moment for her foes.*
In a scene where the Abyssal isn’t present, her player can use this Charm to reveal that she’s been there all along, watching unseen. She rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) with a free full Excellency to establish concealment, and can only be opposed by enemies with magically enhanced senses. Her player must explain how she was able to accomplish this.
Depending on the circumstances, the [[Storyteller]] can set a difficulty that the Abyssal’s roll must meet for her to accomplish this infiltration at all, in addition to her enemy’s opposed rolls: for example, difficulty 2-4 for a well-guarded military camp, difficulty 5-7 for a magically warded manse, or difficulty 10 for a rival Deathlord’s inner sanctum.
If the Abyssal uses this Charm to catch a character in potentially compromising or embarrassing circumstances, she can reflexively use [[Witness of Unspoken Shame]], adding a free full Excellency and doubling 7s. She waives its [[Willpower]] cost, as well as the [[Willpower]] cost to use [[Silence Costs Dearly]] if she succeeds.
## Reset 
Once per story. It can be reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through espionage, infiltration, or blackmail, but can’t be used more than once per session even then.
