In Immaculate fables, the Casteless are Anathema new to their wickedness, those who give in to moral weakness or an impious character and practice forbidden rites to steal a measure of Luna’s divinity. They still seem human, but their souls are gone, devoured from within by the devil that wears their face. In time, they might succumb to the terrifying rage of the Frenzied, the insidious urges of the Face-Stealers, or the blasphemous ambitions of the Ogres. Only the pious Dragon-Blooded can stop these lunatic souls before they grow in power and wickedness. For their unthinkable transgressions and the inhuman evil they’ve unleashed, these Anathema are called the Moon-Mad.
