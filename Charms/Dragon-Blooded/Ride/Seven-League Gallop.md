Imbued with legendary vitality, the Exalt’s mount achieves the apex of speed. She converts one die of her mount’s Speed bonus into a non-Charm success on rolled movement. Outside of combat, her mount’s movement speed is dramatically accelerated, letting her move ([[Essence]]) times the normal distance she’d be able to cover in an hour. If she maintains the use of this Charm throughout a longer journey, the time it takes to complete is halved. Once the Dragon-Blood has spent two [[Willpower]] in a day on this Charm’s cost, she waives the [[Willpower]] cost of all subsequent activations.
