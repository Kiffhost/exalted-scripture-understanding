*The Infernal’s gruesome hungers lead her inevitably to her prey.*

The Infernal adds a non-Charm die on a tracking roll, plus an additional non-Charm die for each condition that applies:
- The Infernal has a negative Tie toward her quarry.
- The Infernal’s quarry suffers a wound penalty.
- The Infernal is capable of eating her quarry.
- The Infernal is tracking her target through a region or location that she has a relevant Lore or Survival specialty in. If she has [[Transcendent Desert Creature]], this always includes harsh, inhospitable terrain.

This Charm can contest magic that perfectly conceals tracks.
