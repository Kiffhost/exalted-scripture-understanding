*The Abyssalâ€™s fists swing with blinding speed, hammering her enemy with blow after blow.*
The Abyssal makes ({Stamina or Strength/ 2, rounded up} + 1) decisive attacks against a single enemy, dividing her [[Initiative]] evenly among all attacks, rounded up. Each 10 that appears on the damage roll of these attacks adds one die to the damage rolls of all subsequent attacks made as part of this Charm.
A [[Brawl]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase increases the number of attacks the Abyssal can make to ({higher of [[Stamina]] or Strength} + 1), and adds additional damage dice: +1 die on the first attack, +2 on the second, and so on.
