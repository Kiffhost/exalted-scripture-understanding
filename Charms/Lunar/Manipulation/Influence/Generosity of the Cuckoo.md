Few can refuse the Lunar’s gifts, be they baskets of poisoned fruit or the red-handed spoils of her latest crime. She offers a gift to a single character without asking anything in return, making a special (Manipulation + [Presence or Socialize]) instill roll with double 8s. If his Resolve is beaten, he takes whatever the Lunar offers. While he may store the object, exchange it, give it away to others, or “use up” limited gifts such as foodstuffs, he can’t discard or abandon the Lunar’s gift. He can’t spend Willpower to resist unless the gift is obviously dangerous, or if accepting it would violate a Major or Defining Intimacy.
