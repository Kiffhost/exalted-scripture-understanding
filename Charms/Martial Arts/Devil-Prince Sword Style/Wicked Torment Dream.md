*The Devil-Prince’s beautiful, complex swordplay makes a hateful answer to a foe foolish enough to defy her, marring flesh and winnowing spirit in return for his audacity.*

The stylist clashes an attack with a difficulty 3 gambit. Success inflicts one level of damage, ignoring Hardness. If her attacker has a [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven Intimacy]], his attack suffers a −(Intimacy) penalty, and the stylist rolls an additional die of damage for each extra success on the Initiative roll, maximum (Intimacy).

This gambit counts as a distract gambit for purposes of this style’s other Charms.
### Terrestrial
This counts as the stylist’s attack for the round.
