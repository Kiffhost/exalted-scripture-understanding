This Charm upgrades the prerequisite, allowing the Solar to offer the committed experience points to ([[Essence]]) different characters, vastly reducing her cost to train multiple specialists. She may also offer half the amount (rounded down) to ([[Essence]] * 5) additional characters. Bear in mind that the Lawgiver still has to commit sufficient time to training all of these characters, or the experience points cannot be spent to improve their traits. 
With this Charm, the Solar can confer [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] she does not personally hold.
