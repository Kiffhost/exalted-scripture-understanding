The Dragon-Blood husbands the flame of her genius, sparking greater heights of creativity. Whenever she’d gain silver craft points as a reward for completing a crafting project or at the end of a story in which she completed a project (Exalted, p. 240), she may instead roll that many dice, rolling an additional die for each 10. 10s grant two silver and one gold craft point; 9s grant one silver and one gold craft point; 8s and 7s grant one silver craft point each.
