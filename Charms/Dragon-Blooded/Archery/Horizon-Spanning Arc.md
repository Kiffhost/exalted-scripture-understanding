The Dragon-Blood bends the winds to her bowstring, loosing a shot that could fly from heaven to earth. After spending two consecutive rounds aiming, she makes a decisive attack out to extreme range (Exalted, p. 197), converting the bonus dice from aiming to non-Charm successes. She must be able to clearly see her enemy, and cannot attack a foe from more than five range bands away. If she hits and incapacitates her foe, she may reflexively take aim at another enemy within long range. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy whose [[Initiative]] was higher than the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s.
