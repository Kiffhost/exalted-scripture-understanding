The wielder’s righteous fury sears her adversary’s soul. When the Exalt successfully compels an offender to submit to her authority, she may activate this Evocation. The offender takes on a Major Principle of his player’s choice that stands in opposition to his actions in the original grievance. This Principle cannot be altered or eroded below Major for the duration of the story. Example: If Moray Darktide of Skullstone uses Rise Up, Penitent! against the pirate-queen who stole his flagship Scarlet Pearl, potential Principles she might take on include “I will not steal from Moray Darktide,” “I will not oppose Skullstone,” or “Piracy is wrong; I will choose another path.” 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonantwithorichalcum,thisEvocationawakensatnocost when she defeats an offender in combat. 

## Resonant

When an offender repents under this Evocation, the wielder gains three Willpower and sheds a point of Limit. This doesn’t include characters temporarily marked as offenders using Way of 10,000 Indignations.
