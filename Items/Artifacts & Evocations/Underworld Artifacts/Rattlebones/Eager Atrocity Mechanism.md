*Rattlebones scuttles to its owner’s hand on creeping fingerbones, eager to fulfill its gruesome purpose.*
The wielder reflexively readies [[Rattlebones]]. Alternatively, if it’s not currently on her person, she may have it crawl one range band in any direction. Any rolls necessary to navigate obstacles or escape restraints use the wielder’s ([[Wits]] + [[Archery]]).
