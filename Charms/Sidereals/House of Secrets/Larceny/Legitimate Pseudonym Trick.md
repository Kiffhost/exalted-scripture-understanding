The Sidereal gains the following benefits when disguising herself as someone whose name she’s stolen with Name-Pilfering Practice
- She ignores the penalty for impersonating unfamiliar people.
- Rolls against her disguise suffer +1 target number.
- She can flawlessly mimic her target’s voice and handwriting.
- If she wears a resplendent destiny that’s appropriate for the name’s owner, she gains −1 target number on cover checks.
