As the Dragon-Blood draws back her arrow against her bowstring, she withdraws and disperses its weightiness, sending it flying like an ephemeral phantom to pierce her foeâ€™s heart. Her withering attack ignores (lower of Essence or Perception) points of soak from armor. If her attack benefits from aiming, she ignores (higher of Essence or Perception) soak instead.
