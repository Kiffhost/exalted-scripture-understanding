*The Infernal turns her gaze to the sunless lands of death, bringing the power of the Yozis to bear against the horrors birthed by their siblings’ murder.*

The Infernal treats un-Exalted undead as demons for purposes of her Infernal Charms if this is advantageous for her. Mindless undead count as First Circle demons for such effects.

While using [[Ultimate Darkness Internalization]] (p. XX), the Infernal treats unExalted undead with Essence 1-3 as First Circle demons.
