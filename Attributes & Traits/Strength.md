Strength represents a character’s raw physical power, the sheer might of what he can achieve by muscle alone. In combat, Strength helps determine the damage a character can deal with his withering attacks, as well as how well he grapples foes. It’s also used when a character wishes to lift, break, or heave any objects or obstacles that might stand in his way
