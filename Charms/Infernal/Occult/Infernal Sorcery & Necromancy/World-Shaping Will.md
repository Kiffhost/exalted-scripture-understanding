*Sorcery is the Infernal’s nature, an instinctual reflex of her soul that needs no effort or concentration.*

The Infernal flurries a Shape Sorcery action with a non-attack action, ignoring all penalties from flurrying. Until the end of her next turn, she may use her confidence in her sorcerous knowledge and power to oppose social influence as if it were a Major Principle, but it can likewise support influence used against her.
## [[Keys]]
#### Thousand Hands Mudra (Occult 5, Essence 3) (+4m, 1wp)
The Infernal may pay a four-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene.
