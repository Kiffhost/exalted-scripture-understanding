*With a snap of her wrist, the Lawgiver hurls two blades, one in the shadow of the other.*
For two motes, this Charm allows the Solar to make two decisive attack rolls and choose the better of the two results for determining damage. For one mote, one [[Willpower]], she may use this Charm to benefit a disarm gambit in exactly the same manner. With either use of the Charm, the Lawgiver’s first weapon forces the target to parry or dodge, creating an opening for the second attack to strike, but this does not create an additional onslaught penalty. For one mote, one [[Willpower]], the Exalt may also use this Charm to reflexively clash a close or ranged attack, though without the reroll effect. The Solar may choose to disarm her opponent on a successful strike—a technique called Shadow Wind Slash—or she may direct her second blade at the target’s vital points for decisive damage, a technique called Shadow Wind Kill. The clash version of this Charm can only be used once per scene, but can be reset by using [[Steel Storm Descending]] to successfully damage an opponent. At [[Essence]] 5+, the Lawgiver may pay three motes on a successful clash to direct one weapon into her target’s hand and the other into his neck (or other exposed regions), both disarming and doing decisive damage.
