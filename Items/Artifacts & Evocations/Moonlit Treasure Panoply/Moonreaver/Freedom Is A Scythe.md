*Moonreaver’s master cuts a path through the othermoon, darting between worlds to strike.*
The wielder vanishes into the othermoon before reappearing up to two range bands horizontally in any direction. This counts as her movement action for the round. If the wielder uses this Evocation while within close range of any enemies, she must reflexively roll to disengage to gain its benefits.
If the wielder reappears within close range of an enemy, she may make a withering or decisive attack against him. If he’s affected by [[Cold Breath of the Moon]], its penalty subtracts from his [[Defense]], soak, and [[Hardness]] against the attack.
Even brief jaunts through the othermoon can be perilous.
The wielder suffers one die of lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]], from exposure to the cold. If she’s damaged, she’s penalized as per [[Cold Breath of the Moon]].
## Dissonant
[[Cold Breath of the Moon]] doesn’t penalize enemies’ [[Defense]] against the attack.
