*Despite being cruelly assaulted, the martial artist clasps her foes to herself. Swallowing her rancor, she seeks no revenge for her wounds—such virtue!*
Storm-Calming Embrace applies double 8s on the (Strength + Martial Arts) control roll of a grapple and adds one success to the roll. However, it also limits the martial artist’s options in the grapple, preventing her from savaging her enemy or throwing him. An enemy who’s poisoned does not count rounds clinched by the Storm-Calming Embrace against the duration of the poison—although he still suffer damage, the poison’s duration doesn’t decrease. 

## Mastery

Storm-Calming Embrace doubles up to (Manipulation) 8s and 9s on the attack and Initiative roll for the grapple, in addition to enhancing the control roll. An enemy caught in the clinch takes lethal damage from poisons, as though he were in Initiative Crash.
