*The wielder traps an enemy with an unexpected portal, sending him right where she wants him.*
When an enemy within short range of the wielder moves between range bands, voluntarily or not, the wielder rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Martial Arts]]) opposing his ([[Dexterity]] + [Athletics or Dodge]). If he fails, he’s unable to avoid the portal, which leaves him one range band in any direction from his starting location. If he had any remaining movement from magic that lets him move multiple range bands, he completes it, but must continue in the same direction he set out in. If this endangers him — e.g., causing him to fall — the Storyteller should allow a roll to avoid it. The wielder can use [[Cutting Rift]] reflexively to extend this Evocation’s range. 
## Reset
Once per round. 
## Resonant
If this brings the enemy within close range of the wielder, she may reflexively make a decisive attack.
