The Lunar sprays corrosive acid from her mouth. For three motes, three [[Initiative]], one [[Willpower]], she rolls an unblockable decisive attack with ([[Stamina]] + [Archery or Athletics]), which takes one of two forms. She can spit at one enemy within medium range, dealing ([[Essence]] + attack roll extra successes) dice of aggravated damage. Alternatively, she can disgorge acid on all other characters, friend or foe, within short range, dealing ([[Essence]]) dice of aggravated damage. Either way, this ignores [[Hardness]] and doesn’t include the Lunar’s [[Initiative]] or reset it. Damaged characters suffer a penalty to soak and [[Hardness]] equal to the levels of damage dealt until their next turn. Alternatively, this Charm can be used for three motes to melt inanimate objects, rolling a feat of demolition with ([[Stamina]] + [Athletics or Resistance]), adding ([[Essence]]) successes. The Lunar uses [[Stamina]] instead of [[Strength]] to determine what feats she may attempt, though she can raise her effective rating with [[Charms]] that enhance feats of strength. This Charm can only be used to attack once per scene, unless reset by crashing an enemy. Feats of demolition don’t require a reset.
