The Lunar acts with fluid grace and incomparable coordination. She makes a flurry that includes at least one physical action, reducing the penalty on each flurried action by one and ignoring the Defense penalty. With Dexterity 5, Essence 3, the Lunar may pay a fourmote surcharge to flurry three actions, although she still canâ€™tincludemorethanoneofthesameactionintheflurry.
