Even the slightest ripple of attention is perceptible to the savvy Dragon-Blood. When her suspicions are roused, she may invoke this Charm to roll (Perception + Larceny). As long as she rolls a single success, she can intuitively discern whether sheâ€™s being watched and by how many people. With Larceny 4, Essence 2, the Dragon-Blood may identify the precise location of an observer if she beats (the higher of his Stealth or Guile).
