*The Sidereal has made a labyrinth of her heart, sealing her secrets away within its coils.*
The Sidereal can treat influence that would make her reveal a secret or do something she knows could give it away as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). She can voluntarily reveal secrets, but doing so causes her to lose this Charm’s protection until she upholds a Defining Intimacy through secrecy, subterfuge, deception, or covert acts. An Oracle can also regain this protection by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
Fellowship to his brow, bringing him under the Mask’s obscure dominion.
The Sidereal touches someone and rolls (Manipulation + Stealth) opposing his ({Appearance or Charisma} + Presence) roll. If successful, he suffers arcane fate (p.
141) for (1 + extra successes) months, or that many days for supernatural beings.
While only Sidereals can create resplendent destinies, the Storyteller should reward creative use of magic. A Solar might approximate a resplendent destiny by using Heart-Eclipsing Shroud and Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise together, etc.
