*Mnemon Beral, son of Mnemon herself, set the house standard for proselytizing across Creation.*
His journeys led him to every corner of Creation, then to the secretive cities of the inhuman Mountain Folk below its surface. The Jadeborn do not speak of their faith in their few exchanges with the Dynasty, but they speak of Beral with the utmost respect. Mnemon Beral never returned home. [[Faith’s Pillar]] did. The Mountain Folk carved it out of respect for Beral’s wisdom and courage against the unholy monsters of the depths, and he carried it into battle against those horrors. After he fell in defense of a Mountain Folk city, the Jadeborn entrusted the weapon to his family. [[Faith’s Pillar]] is a glittering white jade obelisk representing the Imperial Mountain, with symbols for the four outer Directions on each of its faces. At the end of its long haft, the pommel bears a sign of the Center, just as the mountain’s roots reach far below the light of day. [[Faith’s Pillar]] traditionally serves monks of House Mnemon, consecrated in a Mountain Folk dedication ceremony kept by house savants. 

## [[Evocations]] of [[Faith’s Pillar]]

Upon attuning to [[Faith’s Pillar]], the wielder chooses one of her Principles of religious belief or social order to dedicate the [[goremaul]] to, gaining an additional +1 [[Resolve]] against influence opposing it. She may change the chosen [[Intimacy|Principle]] once per story with a ritual rededication.
