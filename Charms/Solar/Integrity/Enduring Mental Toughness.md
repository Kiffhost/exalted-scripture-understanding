*Even in extreme pain, the Exalt does not succumb to despair.*
The Solar may ignore wound, illness, and crippling penalties to her [[Resolve]] or [[Guile]] for one tick. At [[Integrity]] 3+, this Charm can be repurchased, giving it an alternate cost and duration. For five motes, one [[Willpower]] the duration extends to one scene. At [[Integrity]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, this Charm may be repurchased a second time, allowing the Exalt to pay eight motes, one [[Willpower]] to extend the effect to one day.
