# Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Style
Dreaming Pearl Courtesan is a subtle style—graceful, elusive, and lethal. A student learns to maneuver herself into the perfect position to strike, gaining the confidence and trust of her victims as she navigates the veils of defenses they put up between themselves and the world. Once the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan has reached her victim at his most vulnerable—whether that is in the tangle of his boudoir’s sheets, a friendly conversation in a tearoom, or a secret meeting at court—she reveals her true nature as a killer, fighting with a deadly grace and the elusiveness of a dream.
## Weapons
Dreaming Pearl Courtesan style uses elegant unarmed strikes that seem more like dance moves than attacks, as well as war fans and whips. Courtesans also learn to wield numerous improvised weapons with this style through the use of the Charm Elegant Weapon Repertoire, strangling enemies with a silken sash or slashing them with the jagged edge of a broken teacup. 
## Armour
Dreaming Pearl Courtesan style is incompatible with armor.
## Complementary Abilities
Many Dreaming Pearl Courtesans use Dodge, both to evade the attacks of their enemies and to withdraw from close combat. It is also common for them to use Performance or Presence to make influence rolls both in and out combat, which later Charms of this style enhance.
