*Moving in a whirlwind across the battlefield, the Lunar deprives her foes of their armaments.*
She makes a disarm gambit against any number of enemies within close range, making one attack roll and [[Initiative]] roll. The gambit’s difficulty is (enemies hit x2, minimum 3). Alternatively, she may use this Charm with a ranged attack to make a disarm gambit against one foe and all enemies within close range of him, using the same rules as above. This Charm also lets the Lunar make a disarm gambit against an entire battle group, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost. The difficulty of such gambits is (battle group’s [[Size]], minimum 3).
