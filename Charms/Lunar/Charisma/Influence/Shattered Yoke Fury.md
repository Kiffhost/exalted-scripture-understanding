*The Lunar’s transgressive presence erodes hierarchy and decorum, freeing those who hear her to express their anger.*
When she witnesses one or more characters enter a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], they may form a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of rage toward the character influencing them, and can invoke it in the [[Decision Points|Decision Point]]. If they already have a Major [[Intimacy]] opposing the influence, they may instead form a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of rage. Affected characters must immediately act to express their newfound rage, as per a successful inspire action (Exalted, p. 217). If the Lunar uses this Charm together with HardNosed Denial Style’s repurchase effect, she waives this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost.
