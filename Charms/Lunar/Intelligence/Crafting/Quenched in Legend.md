The Lunar breathes unborn dreams into silver and bone. While using Inchoate Wonders Realized, she gains one gold point toward the cost of the project’s next interval when one of the following occurs: 
-  The artifact’s wielder uses it to uphold a Major or Defining Intimacy, achieve a major character or story goal, or complete a legendary social goal. 
-  A character forms a Major or Defining Tie toward the Lunar or the artifact because of an action taken with it. 
-  A character awakens an Evocation from the artifact. 
-  Once per session, when the artifact’s wielder is awarded a two- or three-point stunt on an action using it. At the end of a story in which a character used the artifact to uphold a Defining Intimacy, accomplish a major character or story goal, or achieve a legendary social goal, it gains an additional five gold points. Upon completion, any gold points from this Charm in excess of the final interval’s cost are awarded to the Lunar.
