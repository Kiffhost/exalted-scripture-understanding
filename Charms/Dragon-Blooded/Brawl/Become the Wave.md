The Dragon-Blood lunges for a foe in the same instant that her ally forces him off guard with a feint or harrying strike, turning her ally’s stillness into her speed. Upon receiving the benefit of a successful distract gambit from an ally who hasn’t used his movement action, the Dragon-Blood may reflexively leap one range band towards the gambit’s victim. If she’s already in close range with another enemy, she must reflexively roll to disengage in order to take this reflexive movement. This doesn’t count as her movement for the round, but it does count as the movement action of her ally.
