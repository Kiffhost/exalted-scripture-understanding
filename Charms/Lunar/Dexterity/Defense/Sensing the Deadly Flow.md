Essence-honed instincts guide the Lunar; she anticipates every attack, and sees the path she must follow to avoid or deflect them. Her Defense isn’t reduced by wound penalties, onslaught penalties, or grapples. She waives Golden Tiger Stance’s Initiative cost and removes the Perilous keyword from it, and lowers Bending Before the Storm’s cost by one mote.
