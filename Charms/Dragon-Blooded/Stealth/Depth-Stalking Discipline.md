TheDragon-BloodsubmergesherselfinWaterEssence to wash away anything that might betray her presence. She doubles 9s on Stealth rolls. While surrounded by water, such as being submerged or in driving rain, she doubles 8s and is completely imperceptible by scent â€” able to evade the hunting hounds of a god by fleeing into a storm, or to swim through the sea while bleeding heavily without drawing the notice of siaka. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
