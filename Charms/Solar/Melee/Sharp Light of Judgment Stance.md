Through meditation and practice, the Exalt learns to tap andrefineherSolarEssence,sharpeningherattacksagainst the forces of darkness. This Charm permanently enhances [[Corona of Radiance]], [[Sandstorm-Wind Attack]], and [[Blazing Solar Bolt]]. Attacks made against creatures of darkness during [[Corona of Radiance]] have their minimum damage increased by the Solar’s [[Essence]], while [[Sandstorm-Wind Attack]] and [[Blazing Solar Bolt]] gain an additional bonus to raw damage equal to the Solar’s [[Essence]]. In addition, the Lawgiver may unleash [[Edge of Morning Sunlight]] and the aforementioned [[Charms]] against characters for whom she holds negative Major and Defining Intimacies, treating them as if they were creatures of darkness, if they are not already. Making such an attack against a Major target adds one [[Willpower]] to the cost of an attack, while making such an attack against a Defining foe only adds one mote to the attack’s cost. Any attack against a hated foe that includes the minimum damage bonus from [[Corona of Radiance]] incursacostoftwomotes,evenifitisenhancedbynoother Charm. The benefits (and greater cost) of these [[Charms]] against hated enemies can always be waived.
