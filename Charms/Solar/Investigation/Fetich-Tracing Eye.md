When the Solar is tracking something that was taken from her, she can see lines and traces of that objectâ€™s Essence. This Charm supplements a case scene action to locate stolen items belonging to the Lawgiver, giving her one automatic success to find evidence leading her back to what she has lost. This Charm can also be used in Survival-based tracking rolls.
