*The Abyssal’s words drip with insidious venom, silencing love, compassion, and loyalty.*
When the Abyssal makes an instill or persuade roll, she momentarily suppresses her targets’ positive Ties toward mortals and Principles based on compassion. They can’t use such Intimacies to bolster their [[Resolve]] or in a Decision Point against the deathknight’s influence. If any nontrivial character has a Defining [[Intimacy]] suppressed that would have been applicable against her influence, the Abyssal gains one [[Willpower]].
With a [[Presence]] 5, [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a five-mote surcharge to suppress all positive Ties.
