Each time that Soulfarer claims a life, its victim’s soul is imprisoned forevermore within the grimcleaver’s steely depths, suffusing the weapon with fell puissance. The wielder doubles 10s on a decisive damage roll. The soul of a mortal enemy incapacitated by this attack is drawn out of his body and into Soulfarer, denying him the chance to reincarnate normally or linger in the Underworld as a ghost. Spirits are permanently destroyed if slain by this Evocation. The surge of power from an imprisoned soul lets the wielder roll Join Battle on resetting to base Initiative. Pain-Eating Empowerment can only be used once per scene, unless reset by dealing enough damage with a decisive attack to incapacitate an enemy whose health track was fully undamaged. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience points. It awakens at no cost when the wielder kills a character that she has a positive Major or Defining Tie towards. Both accidental death and deliberate betrayal qualify. 

## Resonant

This Evocation may be used reflexively, after an attack has hit but before damage is rolled.
