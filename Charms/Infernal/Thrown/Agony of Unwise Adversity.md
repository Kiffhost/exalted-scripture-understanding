*The Infernal brings unimaginable horror to those foolish enough to oppose her.*

When an enemy within short range makes an attack against the Infernal, she makes a decisive counterattack against them. The attack receives [[Sweet Agony Savored]]’s benefits for free.

If the Infernal lacks a weapon, she may attack by extruding serpentine emanations of shadow from her anima.
## [[Keys]]
#### Lashing Shadow Rebuke (Thrown 5)
The Infernal can use this Charm against attacks made from within long range. Against enemies within short range, she adds her weapon’s Accuracy on the attack roll, but treats this as dice from Charms. She doesn’t add any dice if she lacks a weapon.
#### Pursuit of Torment (Thrown 5) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm when she succeeds on a roll opposing an enemy’s rush action or his grapple control roll, reflexively attacking him as above.
#### Excoriating Vengeance Arc (Thrown 5, Essence 3)
Once per the scene, the Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to clash an attack instead of making a counterattack. If this increases an enemy’s wound penalty to −5 or higher or incapacitates him, the Willpower surcharge is refunded.
