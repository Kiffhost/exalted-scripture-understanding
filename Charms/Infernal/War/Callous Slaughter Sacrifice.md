*The Infernal’s soldiers are just another currency to her, spent without a second thought.*

When the Infernal is attacked, she allows a willing ally within close range to protect her against that attack, as with a defend other action. Allied battle groups can protect her from short range, and add (Infernal’s Essence/2, rounded up) to their Parry.
## [[Keys]]
#### Aegis of Utter Servitude (+2m)
The Infernal may pay a three-mote surcharge to have her guardian’s defend other last for the rest of the scene. This ends if she moves further than close range from him.
#### Sacrificial Fodder Defense (War 5, Essence 2) (+1m, 1wp)
For a one-mote, one-Willpower surcharge, if a decisive attack beats the guarding character’s Parry, the attacker must direct his attack against that character, rather than the Infernal. If the Infernal uses [[#Aegis of Utter Servitude (+2m)|Aegis of Utter Servitude]], she must pay this surcharge separately for each attack against her. (The mote surcharge isn’t committed).
