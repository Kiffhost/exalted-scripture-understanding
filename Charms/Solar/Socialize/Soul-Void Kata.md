*Upon defending her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] or her motives with an application of [[Guile]], the Solar may activate this Charm.*
Doing so convinces the target he has seen into the Solarâ€™s motives for a moment, but when his gaze returns he finds himself staring into an empty, indescribable gulf of mist and lights. This leaves the target character completely hypnotized and inert. During this time he cannot be socially influenced, and will remain in this hypnotic state for the rest of the scene, unless harshly shaken or worse.
