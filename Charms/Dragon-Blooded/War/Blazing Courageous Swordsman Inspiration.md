The Dragon-Blood leads from the front, a blazing icon that ignites her soldiers’ hearts. She rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10 that appears on a Charismaor Appearance-based command action to give orders. In Fire Aura, bonus dice granted by the Dragon-Blood’s command also add to the battle group’s Willpower rolls to resist being routed this round (Exalted, p. 209).
