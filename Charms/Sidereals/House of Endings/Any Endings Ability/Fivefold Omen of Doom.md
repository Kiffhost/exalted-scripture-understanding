*Like Saturn with her shears, the Sidereal weaves fate with the edge of her blade.*
When the Sidereal would deal 3+ decisive damage to an enemy with an attack, she can forgo one level of damage to reflexively use one of her Descending (Caste) Horoscopes on him, waiving its Willpower cost, in place of that Charm’s usual trigger condition. Any target number reduction on her attack roll also applies to her roll for the Horoscope.
Against mortals, the Sidereal doesn’t need to forgo damage to use this effect. With Essence 5, this applies against all enemies.
## Reset
Once per scene. Using this Charm against mortals doesn’t require a reset.
