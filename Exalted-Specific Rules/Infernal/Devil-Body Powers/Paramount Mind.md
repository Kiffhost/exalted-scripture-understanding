Changed as she is, the Infernal’s mind is truly at rest as at no other time. As long as she isn’t crashed, she’s immune to Derangements, Psyche effects and mind-altering Shaping effects. If she was under the influence of any of these before her transformation, she ignores them for the duration even if she is crashed. The first time she would spend Willpower to resist social influence in the scene, she waives the Willpower cost.

While crashed, the Infernal can be subjected to new effects, though she adds (higher of Essence or 3) to her static values or in automatic successes on rolls against such effects.
