*Spidery glyphs and patterns in garish hues anoint the Infernal’s blade, dripping with the same venom that runs through her veins.*

If the Infernal deals damage with a decisive attack, she envenoms her foe with a poison that has Damage 3i/round, Duration (Infernal’s Essence + 3) rounds, and a −2 penalty.

If the Infernal has a negative Tie that applies to her target, the poison’s duration and penalty both increase by one.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has the [[Toxic Apotheosis (Torment)|Toxic Apotheosis]] feature, she can choose to substitute this Charm’s poison for that feature’s standard traits when she enters her [[Devil-Body]].
## [[Keys]]
#### Caustic Hatred Curse (Essence 2)
The Infernal adds +1 to the poison’s duration, or +3 if she has a negative Tie toward her target. The poison deals aggravated damage to crashed enemies.
#### Hateful Depths Nectar (Medicine 5, Essence 3, [[#Caustic Hatred Curse (Essence 2)|Caustic Hatred Curse]])
The bonuses for having a negative Tie increase by one. The poison’s duration can’t be reduced below one round, no matter how many successes the target rolls.
