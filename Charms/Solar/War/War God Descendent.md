*Solars descend from the highest war god in Heaven.*
They speak armies into existence, and their mere presence is a call to arms. This Charm supplements the Strategic Maneuver roll (p. 211); as the Lawgiver develops a tactic for victory, fighters of the world are drawn to her call to glory. Ignore the -1 penalty for troops with poor drill, and increase the battle groupâ€™s effective [[Size]] by one upon joining battle.
