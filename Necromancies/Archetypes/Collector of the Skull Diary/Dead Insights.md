*Once per story, the necromancer may consult her skulls as she [[Introducing a Fact|introduces a fact]], adding (the number of skulls she possesses, maximum 5) non-Charm successes and letting her use one of the Skull Diaryâ€™s [[Lore]] backgrounds in necromancy, the [[Underworld]], the [[Black Nadir Concordat]], or any other mysteries the [[Storyteller]] deems the Skull Diary to possess.*
The more skulls she collects, the more complete their knowledge becomes.
