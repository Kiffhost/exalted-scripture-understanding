*When the Infernal finally reveals herself, it’s in the aftermath of a massacre.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have concealment against all enemies. She attacks up to two enemies within medium range, plus an additional enemy for every five Initiative she has, maximum (Dexterity + 1). She dashes into close range with each enemy and attacks him before moving on to the next. These attacks don’t break her concealment until she’s completed all of them, and she doesn’t need to roll Stealth when she moves. This uses her movement action.

The Infernal can make either withering or decisive attacks. However, she can’t make two withering attacks in a row, and can’t make more than (Essence) withering attacks total. If she commits in advance to only making decisive attacks, she may divide her Initiative evenly between their damage rolls, rounded up.

If the Infernal ambushes her foes, only the first attack is an ambush, but the Defense penalty inflicted by her subsequent surprise attacks increases to (higher of Essence or 3).

If the Infernal has [[Sudden Death Caress#Drifting Murder Wind|Sudden Death Caress (Drifting Murder Wind)]], its benefits apply to this Charm.
