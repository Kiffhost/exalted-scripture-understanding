*Feeding her blood to another, the Lunar imbues him with primal vitality.*
The Lunar grants a touched character up to ([[Essence]]) temporary −1 health levels, paying one level of aggravated damage for each temporary level she grants. These are the first of her ally’s −1s to be filled when he’s damaged, and they vanish when filled.
When the Lunar uses this Charm on her Solar mate, she need only pay one aggravated health level per two temporary health levels granted, and she can use her mate’s [[Essence]] instead of hers to determine how many she can grant.
