*However much righteous rage Talion’s wielder may expend, she inevitably finds cause to gather more.*
[[Talion]] gains a pool of [[Willpower]], capped at the wielder’s ([[Essence]]), that the Exalt can spend as though it were her own to oppose the offender and his minions. Once per scene, when the Exalt is further wronged by the offender, or she witnesses or learns of a new wrong that the offender has dealt to another, [[Talion]] gains one [[Willpower]]. Concluding or abandoning a grievance empties Talion’s [[Willpower]] pool.

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with orichalcum, this Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder takes up a grievance that appeals to one of her Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] — a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of compassion for the victim, a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of hatred for the offender, or a [[Intimacy|Principle]] whose moral code was violated by the offense would all qualify.
