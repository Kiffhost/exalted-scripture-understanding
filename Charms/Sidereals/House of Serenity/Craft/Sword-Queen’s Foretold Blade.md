*The Sidereal can’t always wait for a foretold hero and a destined blade; sometimes, she must manufacture both.*
The Sidereal imbues one of her resplendent destinies into a mundane object that can be held or worn, which must relate to the destiny’s role or its constellation’s trappings. The Sidereal can’t don the resplendent destiny while it’s imbued, but it still counts against the limit on how many she can have.
The imbued object takes on a semblance more suited to the destiny’s role and becomes an artifact; non-weapon, non-armor artifacts typically have an attunement cost of two motes and an attunement bonus comparable to those of other artifacts. It doesn’t become indestructible like an artifact, but it adds (Sidereal’s Essence) to the difficulty of feats of demolition and other rolls to damage it. The imbued destiny can’t be destroyed by magic like Astrology Interruption Method (p. 350).
Those who wield or wear the artifact are wreathed in its resplendent destiny, concealing their identity and suppressing any other resplendent destinies worn by a Sidereal bearer. However, they might be mistaken for the Sidereal by those who’ve interacted with her while she wore the imbued destiny, or for other bearers of the imbued object. Ordinarily, no cover checks are required for that destiny; however, if the imbued object is carried by a Sidereal, his arcane fate compromises this protection, but he receives −1 target number on such checks.
Evocations can be awakened from the imbued destiny, based on its role and constellation and the Sidereal’s Caste. Sidereals are resonant with them; other characters treat them as exotic materials (Arms of the Chosen, p. 15). If the imbued object is destroyed, characters can still use awakened Evocations if the Sidereal imbues the same resplendent destiny in another object. If the imbued destiny is destroyed or if the Sidereal dies or otherwise leaves the narrative, player characters are refunded experience spent on these Evocations.
The Sidereal can use this Charm multiple times to imbue multiple objects with resplendent destinies.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset when another character uses the imbued object to achieve a major character or story goal.
