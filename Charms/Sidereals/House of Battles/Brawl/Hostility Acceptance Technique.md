Having resigned herself to conflictâ€™s inevitability, the Sidereal rolls with the punches as if it were second nature. The Sidereal can use this Charm after being hit by a withering attack, before the damage roll. The amount of [[Initiative]] she loses from the attack is reduced by (higher of [[Essence]] or 3), although her attacker still receives the full amount. If this prevents the Sidereal from losing any [[Initiative]], she gains one [[Initiative]].
