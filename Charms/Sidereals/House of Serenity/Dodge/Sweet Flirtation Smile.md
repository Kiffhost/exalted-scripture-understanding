*The Sidereal’s pleasing appearance and serene demeanor let her avoid confrontation, sidestepping the enmity of even her worst nemesis.*
The Sidereal makes a special ({Appearance or Manipulation} + [[Dodge]]) instill roll against a character who can perceive her and has a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] that applies to her. If she beats his [[Resolve]], none of his negative Ties can apply to her for the rest of the scene. If the suppression of the victim’s negative Ties would make him act inconsistently with one of his other Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he can spend one [[Willpower]] to resist this influence, becoming immune for the scene.
