The Lawgiver knows the scent of her kith with the warmth of a lioness, the smell of her enemies with the familiarity of a shark. This Charm adds automatic successes to an Awareness roll to detect hidden characters based on their level of intimacy with the Solar. Minor Intimacies add 1 success, while Major and Defining Intimacies add 2 and 3 respectively. The Solar need not suspect that one of her Ties is hiding nearby; Scent-Honing Prana automatically lends itself to applicable rolls without the Solar knowing, though the player may always choose to disregard its use.
