The Dragon-Blood takes the destructive power of fire into her own hands, tempering it so that it will burn only what she wishes it to. She needs no tools to undertake any basic or major project for which a forge or similar source of flame would normally be used, such as smithing a sword or fire-hardening a wooden spear, as well as superior projects to create artifacts from jade (but not other magical materials). The rate at which the Exalt completes work on the project is multiplied by (Essence/2, round up). Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood may use this Charm to channel the blaze through her hands offensively for one scene. Any barehanded attacks she makes using Brawl or Martial Arts set their Overwhelming value to (Essence/2, round up), and double 10s on decisive damage rolls.
