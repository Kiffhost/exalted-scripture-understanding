The Infernal grows to enormous scale and gains the benefits of Legendary Size while transformed:
- Smaller enemies’ attacks don’t inflict onslaught penalties. Magically inflicted onslaught penalties still apply.
- She can’t be reduced below Initiative 1 by smaller characters’ withering attacks unless they have 10+ dice of post-soak damage. Such attacks still award the full amount of Initiative damage rolled.
- She can’t take more than (attacker’s Strength + 3) levels of damage from decisive attacks made by smaller characters. Levels of damage added by magic don’t count against this limit.
- She can’t be grappled by smaller enemies unless they use magic that lets them do so, nor resist her grapple control rolls without such magic.
- She can’t be knocked back by smaller foes’ smash attacks, and is more difficult to knock back with magic (Exalted, p. 274)
