With a shout dredged from the slag of extinct languages, the Exalt unleashes a torrent of anima, force, and sharp black needles across the battlefield. All enemies within short range must roll ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) against a difficulty of the wearer’s ([[Linguistics]]) or be knocked back one range band and fall prone. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wearer isn’t dissonant with soulsteel, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she defeats a character she has a Major or Defining Tie of contempt for. 

## Resonant

Each character who fails his roll loses one point of [[Initiative]] for each success he failed by. The wearer doesn’t gain this [[Initiative]].
