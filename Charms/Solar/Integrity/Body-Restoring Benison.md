Every hour spent meditating using Mind-Cleansing Meditation restores one of the Solar’s damaged health levels, defers her need to eat, and causes the slightest drop of water to nourish her body like a draught from the purest brook. After eight hours spent in such meditations, the Exalt’s hunger is satiated and her thirst slaked exactly as if she had been treated to a filling meal and refreshing water. Under continuous meditations, the Solar can go permanently without food or water. If a spirit recognizes the Lawgiver as king, high priest, or most high prophet in the region of Creation where it dwells, or if the Lawgiver defeats the spirit in combat, then the Solar may use this [[Divine Mantle]] to gain the powers of that spirit’s station. The Solar learns the powers in question instantly and as a matter of instinct, but may only learn [[Charms]] she has the trait minimums for. She can ignore the prerequisite of any Charm, however, and can even embody [[Charms]] which do not have the [[Eclipse]] keyword.
