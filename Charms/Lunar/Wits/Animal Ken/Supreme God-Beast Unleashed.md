Protean [[Essence]] suffuses the Lunar’s familiar, endowing it with illimitable monstrous might. She empowers a familiar within medium range that she’s enhanced with [[Blessed Moon-Beast Empowerment]], granting the following: 
-  Its withering attacks add (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) successes on attack rolls and gain Overwhelming (Lunar’s [[Essence]]). 
-  Its decisive attacks add (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) dice on attack rolls, and double 10s on damage rolls. 
-  It adds +(Lunar’s [[Essence]]) base [[Initiative]]. 
-  It gains +1 [[Defense]], +(Lunar’s [[Essence]]) soak, and [[Hardness]] 10. 
-  It ignores wound penalties. 
-  If it has the Tiny Creature or Minuscule [[Size]] [[Merits]], it gains an additional +1 [[Defense]] and +5 soak, and can damage larger enemies with withering attacks. It can grapple them as though they were the same size, unless they’re Legendary [[Size]]. 
-  It becomes immune to fear-based social influence. 
-  The Lunar reduces the cost of [[Guardian Fang Rebuke]], [[Instinctive Unity Approach]], ThroatRipping Guardian, and the familiar’s magical abilities by two motes each. This Charm ends if the familiar is crashed. It can only be used once per scene, unless reset when one of the Lunar’s familiars incapacitates a nontrivial enemy.
