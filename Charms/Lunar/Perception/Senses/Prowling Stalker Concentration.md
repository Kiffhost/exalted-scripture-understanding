The Lunar takes in a locale’s every detail, studying the lay of the land, the circulation of people, its architecture, and countless other factors until her insights crystallize into transcendent clarity. After at least an hour surveilling a specific location — a building, military camp, forest shrine to a local deity, small cave, etc. — she rolls (Perception + [Awareness, Investigation, or Larceny]). If in a territory she’s claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation (p. XX), she adds (Essence) successes. She banks a pool of non-Charm dice equal to her successes. She may add up to (higher of Essence or 3) banked dice when she takes one of the following actions with any Attribute: 
-  Awareness rolls to detect concealed enemies or hidden dangers within the location. 
-  Larceny rolls to infiltrate the location, such as by picking a lock, disguising herself to pass unnoticed within it, forging documents needed for entry, or stealing a key. 
-  Stealth rolls within the location, taking advantage of her observation of its sight lines and potential hiding places. 
-  Athletics rolls to maneuver through the location or bypass obstacles. 
-  Lore rolls to introduce or challenge facts regarding the location. 
-  Influence rolls to convince a character to grant her entry or pacify guard animals. 
-  Any rolls resisting environmental hazards or traps within the location. This Charm can only be used once per day.
