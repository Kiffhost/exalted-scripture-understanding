*The Infernal has already won. All that remains is to play out her stratagem to its inevitable conclusion.*

The Infernal rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on a Strategic Maneuver roll. She rerolls 5s if at least one of the following is true:
- She has a negative Tie toward the enemy general, his forces, or the leader or cause he fights for.
- The enemy general or the majority of his forces have a Tie of fear toward the Infernal.
- She leads at least one battle group of demons.
- Her opposition includes gods.
## [[Keys]]
#### Masterful Conquest Artistry (+3m)
For a three-mote surcharge, the Infernal adds a non-Charm die on the roll for each condition that she satisfies.
#### All-Conquering Hellbringer (War 3, Essence 2, [[#Masterful Conquest Artistry (+3m)|Masterful Conquest Artistry]])
The dice added by [[#Masterful Conquest Artistry (+3m)|Masterful Conquest Artistry]] are converted to non-Charm successes.
#### Eightfold Masterful General Insight (War 4, [[#All-Conquering Hellbringer (War 3, Essence 2, Masterful Conquest Artistry (+3m) Masterful Conquest Artistry )|All-Conquering Hellbringer]])
Each condition the Infernal meets lets her pick an additional stratagem that she might potentially enact. She may allocate her extra successes among these stratagems however she wishes, and can use multiple stratagems if she rolls enough successes.
