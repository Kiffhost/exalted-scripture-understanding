The Demons of the Third Circle are the very souls of the Yozis themselves. They are beings of world-shaping power and apocalyptic fury. The ritual to summon one of these dreadfiends into Creation can only be performed on a night of Calibration, the five days of darkness that takes place between years, and only once each Calibration. Each Third Circle Demon has its own unique manifestation upon being summoned. Ligier, the Green Sun, appears in a pillar of emerald flames that descends from the starless sky to strike the earth. Ienimea, the River of Faces, condenses as a cloud of mist from the breath of all present before erupting forth from its ephemeral depths. Erembour, That Which Calls to Shadows, rises out of the sorcererâ€™s own shadow, laying an inhumanly alluring hand on her shoulder. Failure to bind a Third Circle Demon is catastrophic. Reversing a failed summoning is impossible, leaving the demon unbound to fulfill its malevolent urges or alien agenda.
