*The Sidereal observes the web of fates around her, reading in it the patterns of her local reality.*
The Sidereal she chooses a specific activity, like “fighting,” “eating,” or “gambling.” She can sense when that activity occurs within (Essence + 3) range bands of her and recognize if anyone or anything she’s familiar with is involved in it but can’t determine the actual course of events. If a character rolls to conceal the activity or his involvement in it, the Sidereal must make an opposing (Perception + Awareness) roll to detect it.
Alternatively, the Sidereal can use this Charm to monitor either mortals or spirits. She can specify any number of activities that she can sense when performed by a mortal or spirit, but can’t sense the activities of other beings.
The Sidereal can stack this Charm to monitor multiple activities.
With an Awareness 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a five-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s range to (Essence) miles. If she stacks multiple uses of this Charm, she need only pay this surcharge once to enhance all of them.
