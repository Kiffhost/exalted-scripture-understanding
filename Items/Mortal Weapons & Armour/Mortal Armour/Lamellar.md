Lamellar armor is a breastplate composed of a series of interlocking horizontal bands. Lamellar is lighter and more flexible than a standard breastplate and allows better air circulation. Lamellar armor is assumed to include greaves to protect the wearer’s lower legs, a skirt to protect his upper legs and bracers to protect his wrists and arms.
