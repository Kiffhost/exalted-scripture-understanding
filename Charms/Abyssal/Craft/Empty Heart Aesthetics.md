*The Abyssal’s artistry lays bare the futility of mortal striving and the fleeting transience of joy.*
When the Abyssal uses Magnificent Cenotaph Allure, she can convey an instill roll to weaken certain positive Intimacies. She can target either positive Ties to a specific object, like “the Realm,” or positive Principles related to a certain subject, like “positive outlooks on life.” The Storyteller should be flexible in applying this — for instance, if the Abyssal targets positive Ties to the Realm, her influence could also undermine positive Ties to the Scarlet Dynasty. Some viewers may be unaffected if they lack sufficient context — a portrait depicting a prince’s famed defeat in battle would mean little to someone who has never heard of him. Affected characters can’t use the weakened Intimacy to strengthen their Resolve or in Decision Points until they’ve recovered Willpower from resting.
