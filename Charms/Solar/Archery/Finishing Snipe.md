*With instincts honed for the kill, the Exalt feels the momentum of battle break and flee her target.*
When an opponent within range suffers crash, the Lawgiver draws on this moment to attack again, even if she has already used a combat action that turn. This attack requires no aim action, but if she wishes to use [[Finishing Snipe]], the Lawgiver must not be engaged in a Simple action that would prevent her from attacking.
