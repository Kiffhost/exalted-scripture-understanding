Five Edicts Dominion channels a word of denial through its wearer’s lips, tainting the air with its chilling timbre. Whenever an enemy within short range of the wearer attempts to rise from prone, she may roll a reflexive threaten action against his Resolve with ([Charisma or Appearance] + Presence). If successful, that character doesn’t dare rise from prone until his next turn. 

## Dissonant

An enemy may pay one Willpower to resist this Evocation for the rest of the scene.
