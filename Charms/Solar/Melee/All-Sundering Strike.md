*The Solar meets an attack with a strike that can cut through the heavens.*
This Charm supplements a clash attack, allowing the Solar to roll her clash twice and take the higher of two results. In addition, any [[Charms]] she uses on the first roll enhance the second roll for free. New [[Charms]] may not be added to the rerolled clash.

### On [[All-Sundering Strike]]

The backer requested a Charm for his Solar who he described as a “master of clashes.” One of the most incomparably strong mechanics in the game is the free “mimic” reroll that copies your [[Charms]]. This Supplemental clash enhancer is limited by its high price point. Backer: Matthew McGuire
