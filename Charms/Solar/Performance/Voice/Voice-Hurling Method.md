With skill to humble a master ventriloquist, the Exalt throws her voice. With this Charm, the Solar can cast her voice out to short range, making it appear to come from particular objects, locations, people or animals. VoiceHurling Method supplements a single social influence action or regular dialogue lasting no longer than ten seconds. When the character is concealed, she may use it to speak without giving away her position, penalizing her opponentâ€™s [[Awareness]] by two successes in the process.
