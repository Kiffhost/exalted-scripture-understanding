*The Abyssal’s forbidding glance leaves pleas and demands alike stillborn upon unwary tongues.*
When the Exalt perceives a character who is about to make an influence roll, she first makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Presence) persuade or threaten roll against him to snuff out his intentions. If successful, he doesn’t make the influence roll and forgets the objective he was trying to achieve with it for the rest of the scene. If someone tries to remind him of it, he may pay one Willpower to resist.
## Reset
This Charm can’t be used against a character more than once per scene.
