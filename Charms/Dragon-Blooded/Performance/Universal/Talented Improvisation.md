The Dragon-Blood is moved by an innate genius for performance, intuiting the entire composition of a song after hearing only a few notes or turning a clumsy misstep into the beginning of a provocative dance. After making a Performance roll, she rerolls (Essence) non-1 failed dice. If she uses a stunt to explain how she recovers from her misstep, this Charm’s cost is reduced by the stunt’s level.
