*No giant is beyond death.*
The Abyssal adds (Essence) automatic successes on a grapple attack roll, and her enemy’s 1s on the control roll subtract successes. For the duration of the grapple, she adds (Essence) dice of damage on savaging attacks.
If she knows Blood-Drinking Palm, its Initiative cost is reduced by one.
The Abyssal can use this Charm to grapple enemies with Legendary Size, though she can’t drag, restrain, throw, or slam them without an appropriate stunt.
