Standing at the boundary of order and chaos, the Lunar reconciles the two to create an enclave of safety. She may stabilize the Wyld within territories claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]]. This is an extended ([[Wits]] + [Integrity, [[Lore]], or Occult]) roll, interval one day. Difficulty and goal number depend on the Wyld’s intensity: difficulty 4, goal number 20 for bordermarches; difficulty 6, goal number 40 for middlemarches; difficulty 8, goal number 60 for deep Wyld. Success renders the Wyld more amenable to habitation. While it remains unbound by Creation’s natural laws, it won’t assume a state that makes human habitation impossible. A neutralized bordermarch no longer causes mutation or addiction. Characters in a neutralized middlemarch or deep Wyld add (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) bonus dice on rolls to resist such effects. IftheLunar’sSolarmateusesWyld-ShapingTechnique (Exalted, p. 335) within deep Wyld stabilized with this Charm, he adds (his positive Tie toward the Lunar + 1) dice on all shaping rolls. If the Lunar revokes her claim to the territory or dies, the Wyld reasserts its full strength.
