It’s easier to pluck a jewel from within a briar hedge than from a Dragon-Blood’s pocket. All rolls to pickpocket the Exalt or disarm her from close range lose ([[Essence]]) dice. On a failed roll, the would-be thief suffers a single level of lethal damage as invisible thorns of [[Essence]] pierce his hand, visibly marking his crimes.
