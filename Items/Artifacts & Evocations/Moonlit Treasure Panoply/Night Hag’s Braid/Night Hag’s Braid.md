Long ago, when the Old Realm still was young, a witch came to a faerie queen’s palace. A sorcerer and spirit-binder, Thousand Rainbow Petals had come to the Court of Unlit Candles as an emissary of the Exalted host, seeking to pact with the court’s leader, Kethara of Sere Autumn. Kethara welcomed them as an honored guest, giving great consideration to the Lunar envoy’s words.
Therein lay the trap. Kethara was obsession personified, and sought to claim the Lunar as her champion. She hid words of binding within the terms of their treaty, twisting the pact to trick Thousand Rainbow Petals into swearing eternal service to her.
It might have worked, had Thousand Rainbow Petals been a lesser witch. Not long after their arrival to the court, they’d unraveled the court’s ever-shifting web of alliances, vendettas, and rivalries. The Lunar had made other bargains with Kethara’s enemies, and learned of her schemes long in advance. When the two of them swore to their pact, it was the queen who was bound, for Thousand Rainbow Petals had changed the oath’s terms at the last minute.
As punishment for Kethara’s treachery, Thousand Rainbow Petals plucked every hair from her head.
Braiding the faerie queen’s hairs together with wirethin lengths of moonsilver, the Lunar created the Night Hag’s Braid, a trophy of Kethara’s defeat and a warning to others who would cross the witch. Having exacted their justice, Thousand Rainbow Petals departed, leaving Kethara to the mercies of her own court.
The Night Hag’s Braid has had many masters since Thousand Rainbow Petals. Lost in the Usurpation, the Silver Pact discovered it by chance when the Lunar Dances-Between-Raindrops infiltrated the fortress-manse of the direlash’s current owner, the warlord-savant Taharu Voja. Since then, it’s been passed down among the Pact’s mystics, shamans, and sorcerers. 
 
## Evocations of the Night Hag’s Braid

This direlash’s Evocations curse enemies with a fae delirium that echoes Kethara’s curse, sapping their strength to empower the direlash’s wielder. Its Evocations also aid sorcerers who rely on spells in combat.
Upon attuning to the Night Hag’s Braid, the wielder awakens Accursed Lash for free.
# MOONREAVER’S PENALTIES The penalties inflicted by Beneath a Strange Sky and Moonlit Horizon Reaper count for Evocations that gain additional benefits against enemies penalized by Cold Breath of the Moon.
