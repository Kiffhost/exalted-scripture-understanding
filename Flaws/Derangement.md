The character is afflicted, suffering some malady of the mind. All Derangements are of either Minor, Major, or Defining severity, and may be exploited by social influence as though they were an [[Intimacy]]. Resisting a [[Derangement]] is possible, but costs one [[Willpower]] point per session or day (whichever is longer) for a Minor [[Derangement]], one point per session or day (whichever is shorter) for a Major [[Derangement]], or one point per scene for a Defining [[Derangement]]. A few examples are provided below:

# Hysteria
The character’s emotions swing out of control when he botches a roll or is subjected to extreme stress or anxiety, causing him to lash out at others or attempt to flee into isolation if he fails a [[Willpower]] roll against difficulty 1 (for Minor), 3 (for Major) or 5 (for Defining). 

# Madness
Intense trauma has caused the character to withdraw from reality, experiencing hallucinations and violent emotional swings. These symptoms manifest when the character botches a roll, experiences intense anxiety, or runs out of temporary [[Willpower]], unless she makes a [[Willpower]] roll against difficulty 1 (for Minor), 3 (for Major) or 5 (for Defining). 

# Megrims
The character is prone to black moods and depressive periods of despair and lassitude. Whenever the character botches a roll or drops to zero temporary [[Willpower]], she must make a [[Willpower]] roll against difficulty 1 (for Minor), 3 (for Major) or 5 (for Defining). Failure prevents her from spending any [[Willpower]] for the next several days, except to temporarily suppress the [[Derangement]]. 

# Obsession
The character is fixated on a certain idea, person, action, or object. When it’s present, the character will focus on it to the exclusion of more pressing concerns. When the character is out of temporary [[Willpower]], he will drop what he’s doing to seek out or indulge in the object of obsession unless he makes a [[Willpower]] roll against difficulty 1 (for Minor), 3 (for Major) or 5 (for Defining). 

# Paranoia
The character harbors delusions of persecution, and often mistrusts all those around her. Whenever the character is subjected to intense stress, this [[Derangement]] compels her to distrust all strangers, and negates the benefits of all her positive Ties unless she succeeds at a [[Willpower]] roll against difficulty 1 (for Minor), 3 (for Major) or 5 (for Defining).
