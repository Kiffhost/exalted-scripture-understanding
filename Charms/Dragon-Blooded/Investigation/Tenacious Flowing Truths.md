Attuning her senses to the ebb and flow of truth and lies, the Dragon-Blood can solve even the most challenging cases. She ignores (Essence) points of penalties on rolls to case a scene, as well as on Awareness rolls opposing Larceny. In Water Aura, the Exalt also adds an automatic success on all rolls that benefit from this Charm.
