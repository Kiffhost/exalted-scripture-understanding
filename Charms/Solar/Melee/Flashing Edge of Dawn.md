The Solar moves her blade with the speed of her scorn, cutting through her foe in the moment he chooses to strike. The Exalt may use this Charm in response to any attack she attempts to parry, creating a [[Melee]] counterattack that occurs after the opponent’s attack result, but before damage has been rolled. This attack acts as a special withering attack, with successes on the damage roll reducing the target’s [[Initiative]]. However, rather than being added to the Solar’s [[Initiative]], these points are converted immediately to decisive damage dice and rolled against the target’s health track, ignoring hardness. This damage occurs independently of the Solar’s current [[Initiative]] and does not return her to base. [[Flashing Edge of Dawn]] does not count as the Exalt’s combat action and cannot be used in response to another counterattack.
