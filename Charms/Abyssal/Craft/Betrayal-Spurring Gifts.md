*The gifts and treasures that fall from the hands of Death’s Lawgiver are fetters for those who claim them, subjugating them to her dark will.*
The Abyssal may use [[social influence]] to leverage gifts she’s made for others as though they were [[Intimacy|Tie]]s of gratitude to her. Gifts created with [[Basic Project|basic]] or [[Major Project|major projects]] count as Minor Ties; those made with [[Superior Project|superior projects]] count as Major Ties; those made with [[Legendary Project|legendary projects]] count as Defining Ties. The gift need not be on a target’s person, so long as he remains in possession of it.
Additionally, while using this Charm, the Abyssal waives the mote costs of [[Drawn to Death’s Beauty]], [[Five-Fold Malice Curse]], [[Magnificent Cenotaph Allure]], and [[Soul-Tarnishing Treasures]], including uses that are already active. Once this Charm ends, she must commit those Charms’ mote costs as usual to maintain them.
