*The Infernal waltzes and pirouettes with the Arrow Wind of Hell when she wishes, dancing around lesser projectiles.*

When an enemy makes a ranged attack against the Infernal, his 1s subtract successes. If the Infernal’s attacker is at medium range or further from her, his 2s subtract successes as well. If the Infernal successfully dodges, the attacker loses one point of Initiative for each success subtracted from his roll, maximum (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3).

This Charm’s Initiative cost is waived against attacks from long range or beyond.
## [[Keys]]
#### Arrow Wind’s Embrace (Dodge 4, Essence 2)
The Infernal gains the Initiative lost by her attacker, maximum (Essence).
