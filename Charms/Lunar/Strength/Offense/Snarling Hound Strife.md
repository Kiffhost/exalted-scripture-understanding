As the Lunar and her foe lunge at each other, the superior predator emerges triumphant. When she clashes with an enemy with equal or lower Initiative, 1s on his attack roll subtract successes, maximum (Lunar’s Essence). If such an enemy initiates the clash with magic, she may declare this Charm reflexively before rolling. If she wins a clash with a decisive attack that resets her Initiative, she adds (Essence) of her enemy’s 1s to her base Initiative.
