The Dragon-Blood stalks her victim calmly but inexorably, slowly gathering force until she finally draws blood. This Charm can only be used in concealment. The Dragon-Blood chooses a character, and gains one point of [[Initiative]] each turn that she moves towards him without breaking concealment. If she leaves concealment or fails to pursue the chosen target, this Charm ends. If the Dragon-Blood ends this Charm by making an unexpected attack, she may expend her Water Aura to dissolve into dark water as she lunges forward, ignoring ([[Essence]] + 2) points of soak on a withering attack, or ignoring ([[Essence]]) points of [[Hardness]] and doubling 10s on the damage roll of a decisive attack.
