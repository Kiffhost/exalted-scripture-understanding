Sunflash is both weapon and prayer — an elegant, ornately forgedtoolwhoseveryexistenceisaprayertoKiragaru,the god of killing at a distance. A massive orichalcum chakram, Sunflash is over two feet in diameter, with a hundred razor-sharp blades around its outer rim inlaid with red jade that spell out the prayer in flight. When thrown, it spins like a prayer wheel, spelling out an invocation of Kiragaru and kindling the flames of divine anima. It was forged by Merciful Akiva, a Zenith Caste who sought to court the god’s attention with her craft. There are no records of their romance, if there ever was one, but Sunflash’s legend has remained prominent throughout history. Sunflash was looted in the Usurpation, carried away by a foolishDragon-BloodwhoswiftlymethisendatKiragaru’s hands. After that, the god provided clear instructions to the Sidereal Exalted responsible on interring Sunflash and Akiva’s remains. But when the scavenger king Mogu looted it from the tomb a millennium later, Kiragaru manifested not to kill him, but to test his morals, offering parables and wisdom that might improve his irreverent heart — a test that he repeats for each inheritor of the weapon. At times, Sunflash finds its way into temples and shrines of Kiragaru. There it is venerated as a relic, but the god ensures through dreams and portents that his priesthood finds suitable candidates for the weapon’s legacy. 
 
## Evocations of Sunflash

Sunflash possesses an anima banner much like a Solar’s (Exalted, p. 174), with its totemic display depicting a shining manifestation of Kiragaru. When its wielder Joins Battle or incapacitates a non-trivial enemy with Sunflash, its anima banner progresses one level. Decisive attacks made with Sunflash ignore one point of Hardness for each level of its anima. At the end of a scene, its anima banner resets to dim.
