Seizing on martial instinct, the Dragon-Blood hardens her limbs with Essence. She grants an unarmed attack the Smashing tag (Exalted, p. 586). An unarmed withering attack roll adds an automatic success on the attack roll and (Essence/2, rounded up) Overwhelming. In Earth Aura, the Overwhelming bonus increases to (Essence).
