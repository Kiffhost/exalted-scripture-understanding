Telling herself the ultimate lie, the Lunar forgets herself. To use this Charm, she must be in the shape of a human to whom she has a [[Intimacy|Tie]], or an animal shape. She twists her identity into that of her shape, overwriting her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] with that character’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], or a set of [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that the Storyteller deems an appropriate representation of that character’s personality or animal’s instincts. Her true [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] are suppressed — she can act against them without eroding them or gaining [[Limit]], they don’t modify her [[Resolve]], they can’t be discerned with read intentions rolls, etc. The Lunar retains her memories, but they’re distorted to fit her new identity. Memories that can’t be reconciled withtheidentityarerepressed.Shecanstillactonhertrue motives, though distorted memories or her overwritten [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] might influence how or if she does so. As the Lunar is not aware that she’s a shapeshifter, she can’t voluntarily leave her current shape. She can still use [[Charms]], [[Evocations]],andspells,thoughshemaybesurprisedbythis power and believe it to be a blessing or curse. The Lunar may define one condition that will end this Charm when she uses it, such as a certain amount of time passing, hearing a particular phrase, or witnessing a specific person’s death. She can’t voluntarily end this Charm except at a story’s end, or if she witnesses a threat to one of her true Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], or her Solar mate.
