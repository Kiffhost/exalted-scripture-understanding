*This hearthstone appears as a glassy black stone, smouldering with red-green in its heart.*
If the owner knows the Charm [[Charms/Abyssal/Occult/Terrestrial Circle Sorcery]], this hearthstone grants knowledge of one fire-type spell of the Terrestrial Circle (excluding any spells which summon minions, such as [[Summon Elemental]]) while socketed in an attuned artifact. Once a spell has been cast using this hearthstone, it remains imprinted on the hearthstone until the owner learns to cast the spell on her own.
