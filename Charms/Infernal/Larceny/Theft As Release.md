*The Infernal’s theft frees others from the weight of their cherished possessions.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after stealing an object from someone, making a special (Manipulation + Larceny) instill roll against him. She can use Charms that enhance pickpocketing on this roll. Success causes her target to believe that he never owned that object, or to take a “sour grapes” attitude and reject that object as worthless. He can resist this influence for one Willpower, but must wait at least (Infernal’s Essence) minutes to do so, giving her time to flee the scene.
## [[Keys]]
#### Windswept Burden Release (Larceny 5)
The Infernal can use this Charm after disarming an enemy, convincing him to give her an object, or relieving him of something on his person by other means. If the Infernal makes a disarm gambit and succeeds on this Charm’s influence roll, the gambit’s Initiative cost is refunded.
