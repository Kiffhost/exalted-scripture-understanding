*The Infernal shifts between aspects of titanic power, giving form to the fullness of her terrible power.*

Upon purchasing this Charm, the Infernal’s player creates a secondary Devil-Body form, following the usual rules. She can choose which of her Devil-Bodies she enters when invoking that power. If she has Transcendent Devil-Body Perfection, its benefits apply to additional Devil-Bodies, letting her choose different features for each.
### Keys
#### Many-Faced God Delusion (Essence 3)
The Infernal gains an additional Devil-Body. With Essence 5, she can repurchase this key any number of times.
