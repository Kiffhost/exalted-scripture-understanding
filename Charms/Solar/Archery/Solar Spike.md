The Lawgiver draws a blazing bolt of Essence across her bowandfiresit.Theattackignorestherangeofherweapon, and can be made from medium or long range without an aimaction,orextremerangewithanaimaction.TheExalt must have higher Initiative than her target to use this attack; the conjured Spike does not use the Solar’s Initiative to do damage, but instead has a raw damage equal to her current temporary Willpower multiplied by oneor the rating of any Intimacy she is trying to uphold or protect. Solar Spike is incompatible with Fiery Arrow Attack and Rain of Feathered Death, and does not reset the Exalt’s Initiative to base on a hit. Solar Spike may only be used once per scene, but can be reset by landing a withering attack with six 10s rolled across the attack and damage rolls.
