*The passion within [[Pyre of Legions]] cannot be contained in the form of a single hero — she’s consumed alive, becoming a walking pyre that scorches the earth around her.*
On her turn, she wreathes herself in a bonfire (difficulty 5, damage 4L/round) that extends out to short range, moving with her. The flames deal her no damage (other than the health level cost). If she activated this !!Evocationonherpreviousturn,shewaivesitsmotecost.!!
