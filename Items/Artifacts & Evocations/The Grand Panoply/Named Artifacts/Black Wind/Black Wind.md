Forged in the early days of the First Age to bring death and terror to traitors and outlaws, this soulsteel skycutter’s killing edge spans nearly a yard, and gleams red when it catches the light of the sun. It possesses a single hearthstone socket on the left side of the blade. Black Wind’s surface is glossy, almost featureless for soulsteel, until blood graces its edge. Then the faces of one hundred murderers whose souls were forged into its substance may sometimes be glimpsed, mouths open soundlessly somewhere beneath the crimson and black. Black Wind was first carried by Shih Azen, Night Caste and veteran of the Niobraran conflict, in those days when the Solars were still consolidating their rule over an untamed Creation. Many were the meetings of saboteurs or the revels of professional killers which fell silent as a low keening cut through the night—followed, always, by blood and screams. Shih Azen hunted mortal conspirators, traitorous gods, prehuman cannibal-cults, and Exalted murderers alike, and those who carried Black Wind after him continued this tradition of deadly justice until the night of the Usurpation. Since then, the skycutter has been an assassin’s tool. Black Wind was sealed away 110 years ago by the master assassin Sesus Choran. He hid it in a cave located deep within a demesne in the frozen wastes of the North, behind ropes washed with sacred oils and hung with prayer strips. Choran had become convinced the skycutter wished him dead, that it resented being wielded by those who had cut down its former masters. He could no longer bring himself to hurl it, certain that it would swing back seeking his life. 

## Evocations of Black Wind

A Solar who attunes Black Wind gains the following power: When the skycutter tears through an opponent’s flesh (inflicting lethal damage with a decisive attack), the arc of blood that trails behind it freezes into a gleaming blade that arcs along after Black Wind. Each such blade adds +1 to the raw damage of all withering attacks made with Black Wind. All blood blades evanesce into motes of red-black Essence after the skycutter isn’t thrown for two consecutive turns, and the weapon can sustain no more than five blades at once. This power is ineffective against bloodless foes.
