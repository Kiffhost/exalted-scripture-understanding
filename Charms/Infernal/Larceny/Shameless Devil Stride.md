*The Infernal carries herself with a bearing of unquestionable legitimacy, welcome in the halls of princes and priests.*

Onlookers who see the Infernal don’t register the significance of any details of her appearance or demeanour that suggest she’s a criminal, outsider, or undesirable (dress, ethnicity, tattoos, accents), nor any that make her seem inhuman or monstrous (mutations, weapons, etc.). They still notice these features, but can’t draw the connection between those details and what they suggest.

Once the scene ends, nontrivial characters can pay one Willpower to fully recognize any obscured details, believing that they were simply too frightened or scandalized to think straight.
