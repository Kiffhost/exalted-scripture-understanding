The Dragon-Blood’s wandering fingers strike suddenly and without warning, wresting away treasures like a riptide. She doubles 9s on a roll to pickpocket or steal from a character, and increases the difficulty of noticing the theft for all characters other than the victim by (Essence) unless they use magic or superhuman senses to oppose her roll. Even if she fails, her target doesn’t realize she was trying to steal from him unless he beats her roll with (Essence) threshold successes. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
