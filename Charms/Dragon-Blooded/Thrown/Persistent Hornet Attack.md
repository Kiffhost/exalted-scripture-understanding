The Dragon-Blood’s weapon takes to the air with a life of its own, pursuing her foes like a murderous metal wasp. She makes a withering attack, but doesn’t gain any Initiative from it (including Initiative Breaks). Instead, if she hits, that Initiative is transferred to her weapon, which enters battle as a living weapon carried on the wind, orbiting the target at close range. The weapon cannot act until the round after this Charm is used. The only actions it can take are to reflexively move, aim, or attack an enemy at close range. The weapon uses the Dragon-Blood’s dice pools, but she cannot use Charms or other magic to enhance its actions. The weapon has its own separate Initiative, which benefits from its withering attacks and determines the damage of its decisive attacks. Upon successfully landing a decisive attack, this Charm ends. If it goes a round without aiming or landing an attack, it loses three Initiative. The weapon has Defense and soak (higher of Essence or Wits). It can be targeted with withering attacks or knocked out of the air with a successful disarm gambit, ending this Charm.
