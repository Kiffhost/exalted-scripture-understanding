When one of the ancient enemies of the gods — a being of terrible beauty and unthinkable majesty — was slain by the Exalted, its blood fell as a stream of unearthly jewels. The Ascending Sun who struck the killing blow was enthralled with the jewels and claimed them as trophies, having them set into a crown as a sign of her power. But the ancient one’s pride and malice lingered in the jewels, corrupting the Solar. Her reign became a terrible thing, and she was eventually reviled even by her own kin. When she perished, the crown was stolen before it could be buried with her. Many a prince has donned it across the ages since, each rising to greatness only to succumb to calamity. Vainglory appears as a heavy orichalcum coronet, its band set with a dozen gemstones as large as eyes and of no color found on any earthly spectrum. The crown is surprisingly aerodynamic, and though the jewels are cool, smooth cabochon stones, they burn like fire and cut like knives as they spin by. 
 
## Evocations of Vainglory

Forged in arrogance and tempered in hubris, Vainglory sustainsandfeedsuponitswearer’svanity.ItsEvocations rely on its wielder’s Conceit — her strongest Intimacy of pride, couched in terms of personal ambition or satisfaction with her own talents, achievements, wealth, influence, or the like, including disdain for others who fail to equal her. She adds (Conceit) bonus dice on rolls to instill a Tie towards herself. She also adds (Conceit) to her Resolve against social influence that would cause her to doubt or reject herself or her actions. The crown’s curse cries out for its power to be used, and it will embrace any suitable vessel. A mortal with a prideful Defining Intimacy may spend five temporary Willpower to attune Vainglory. She gains access to the above powers, and can wield Vainglory as a thrown weapon, but cannot awaken Evocations.
