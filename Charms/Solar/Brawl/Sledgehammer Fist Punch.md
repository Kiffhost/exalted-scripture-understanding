The Exalt concentrates her anima around her fist, increasing its weight and hardness as she strikes a blow against an object. This attack is neither withering nor decisive and adds (Strength) automatic successes to the damage roll. This Charm greatly enhances a (Strength+Athletics) based attempt to punch through an object; if the Solar’s totals approach viability for such a feat, this Charm allows her to greatly speed up the demolition, based on the durability of the object she strikes and the stunt she performs. For example, a Strength 3, Athletics 3 character who is properly motivated could use this Charm to dash a heavy iron lock from a coffer with the heel  of her boot, where a simpler feat might involve a brawler who draws her fist along the cobbles of a street or the stones of a wall, pulping the stony surface into a fine sand to blind her opponent with a punch. Using Sledgehammer Fist Punch in such a way may be done reflexively (though the character can still only take a reasonable number of such reflexive actions per round, at the Storyteller’s discretion), but using it to cause harm indirectly (by e.g. collapsing a pillar or kicking a stack of barrels down onto someone) requires that it supplement a combat action.
