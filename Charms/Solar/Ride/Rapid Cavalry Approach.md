Infusing her chosen mount with Solar Essence, she lightens its body and magnifies its strength, allowing it to run at tremendous speeds. To activate this Charm, the Exalt must be at extreme range from all opponents. For seven motes, this Charm allows a naturally fast mount such as a horse or a great cat to move three range bands per turn. For twelve motes, it can confer the same effect to a slow or gigantic mount such as an ox or an elephant. Once within longrangeofanyopponents,theLawgiverâ€™smountedspeed is reduced to two bands per turn. This Charm ends if the Exaltorthemountattacksatarget,oriftheSolariscrashed.
