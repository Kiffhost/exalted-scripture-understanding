While this moonstone is socketed in an attuned one-handed artifact weapon, the Exalt can create a single duplicate of the weapon from moonlight and shadow as a miscellaneous action. The duplicate has the same traits as the original, granting the benefits of dual wielding, but doesnâ€™t have any of its magical effects. It dissolves if either it or the original is wielded by another.
