*Binding the souls of slaughtered champions, the Abyssal damns them to glory in her service.*
After a scene in which the Abyssal used Death Is No Respite, she gives a speech to the corpses littering the battlefield, condemning or praising them as she sees fit. She can raise nontrivial mortals as war ghosts (Exalted, p. 504) instead of zombies, paying three motes per ghost and one Willpower. Alternatively, she can raise their hungry ghosts (Exalted, p. 503) if her speech appeals to primal passion. They’re still bound by that Charm’s Tie of loyalty.
