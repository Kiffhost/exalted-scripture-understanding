The Lawgiver’s understanding of rules and the semantics of language makes her an effective and persuasive speaker. Add half the Solar’s Bureaucracy in dice (rounded up) to any social influence that engages a character’s adherence to laws or rules he’s known to observe. This can refer to organizations he identifies with, but it can also be used to exploit Defining Principles he holds, if the Solar is aware of them.
