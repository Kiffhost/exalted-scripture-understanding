Sail is a bit of an odd Ability—it’s generally either central to a chronicle or not used at all. The following rules and guidelines exist to add excitement and drama to a sailing-centric chronicle, such as tales of piracy and naval conquest among the Western archipelagos or the Dreaming Sea, or trade, travel, piracy, and war along the great rivers of the near East. If you’re going to run or play in a game focusing on palace intrigues, greedy merchants, and scheming sorcerers in a shining city deep in the Southern desert, you can probably skip this section.
# Sailing Rules
For the most part, sailing works like any other Ability—a player wants to do something and the Storyteller asks for an (Attribute + Ability) roll and sets a difficulty. (Intelligence + Sail) might be used to gauge the weather and tides, while (Wits + Sail) might be used to navigate through treacherous rocks. In addition, the quality and nature of your ship has a significant impact on your rolls, adding modifiers in many situations.
## Ship Traits
Ships are built for countless purposes, from fat-bellied cargo vessels to sleek couriers to the Realm’s deadly ship-hunting triremes. A number of traits are used to distinguish them: [[Crew]], [[Hull]], [[Ship Speed]], [[Maneuverability]].
## Pursuit
Before a pirate can plunder her prey, or a naval vessel interdict another ship, they must first close with their quarry. Pursuit is an extended, contested (Wits + Sail + Speed) roll, with the first ship to accumulate 10 more successes than its antagonist accomplishing its goal—either escaping beyond sight, or catching up to combat range.
## Troubled Waters
Exalted captains must often navigate their ships through hazards at sea—storms, deadly reefs, fields of Sargasso. Navigating through a hazard requires succeeding at a number of Sail rolls against a difficulty set by the Storyteller—the more deadly the hazard, the higher the difficulty, while the larger the hazard, the more rolls are required. 
<details><summary>Example</summary>
Navigating through an overnight gale without being blown off-course might require five (Wits + Sail) rolls at difficulty 1, while a terrible storm would be difficulty 3, and a hurricane difficulty 5; steering through a deadly reef to reach the shores of an uncharted isle might call for a pair of difficulty 3 (Wits + Sail) rolls; navigating the legendary Sargasso sea around Bluehaven to find the hidden pirates’ lair might require ten rolls at difficulty 5. Success leads the ship closer to safety or its destination. Failure may blow a ship off-course, leave it stranded in tangling weeds and in need of breaking free before it can proceed, or might inflict a point of damage to the hull, depending on the hazard.</details>

# Naval Combat
Once two ships have closed to combat range with one another, they have entered naval combat. Naval combat proceeds in [[time#Round|rounds]]; during each round, each ship’s captain declares an enemy ship he wishes to oppose. The players then select a stratagem from the list below to enact, and make the indicated roll. If she garners more successes than the ship she’s picked to oppose, her stratagem succeeds. This is the Naval Maneuver roll. If opposed by two or more other ships, the player’s roll suffers a -2 penalty for each ship beyond the first.

The key to naval combat is **Momentum**, a pool of points gained from [[positioning]] stratagems. **Momentum** is required to attempt most stratagems, and so the goal of naval combat is to accumulate Momentum faster than one’s enemies, then expend it to damage their ship or board them.

Selecting a different ship to oppose than you selected during the last round causes you to lose all your Momentum.
## Stratagems
Naval stratagems each have a roll with an associated set of traits, most commonly [[Wits]]+[[Sail]]+[[Maneuverability]].

### Boarding Actions
Boarding actions are enacted by winning a Naval Maneuver roll, just like any other stratagem, but warrant a bit of additional discussion. There are several ways to mount a boarding action, each of which is its own separate stratagem. 

When a player boards a ship or has his ship boarded, drop from naval combat down to regular combat and resolve the battle according to the stratagem employed (this works much like the [[strategic warfare]] system). When a Storyteller character’s ship boards another Storyteller character’s ship, the Storyteller should generally just dictate the results according to the mettle and quality of the fighters in question—it’s less impartial than letting the dice dictate the results, but few players want to take a fifteen-minute break to watch the Storyteller roll dice against herself.

All boarding actions subject both forces to the rules of the [[Back to the Sea]] stratagem— to wit, rally for numbers actions restore one point of [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] per three successes, and [[slaughter]] actions directed at a routed battle group are extremely effective since there’s nowhere to flee on a ship but over the rail.
# Make These Rules Your Own
#advice/storyteller 
While the above rules provide a framework for exciting ocean adventures and naval conflict, they’re just a framework. You should come up with your own stratagems, stunting to create new stratagems for unique circumstances. Just assign an appropriate dice pool and Momentum cost, and go with it.

<details><summary>Lengthy Example</summary>
Mnemon Valen’s ship is rushing to pick up a load of recovered First Age relics from a dig on a small Western isle when it encounters a mighty behemoth—something like a whale, but also like an island.<br><br>
One player wants to use a Naval Maneuver to frighten the beast away with a loud, flashy display of sorcery, and the Storyteller begins devising an Intimidate stratagem—he thinks that (Wits + Sail + Maneuverability) is appropriate to get the ship into place just in time for the sorcerer to launch a spell to shock and threaten the behemoth, and that it should cost 10 Momentum—comparable to an Escape stratagem, but a bit cheaper, because the Storyteller thinks the behemoth might remember the threat, and become a problem later in the chronicle. He’ll treat the behemoth like an enormous, powerful warship for the purpose of this encounter, and quickly sketches out traits for it—Speed +4, Maneuverability +1, Hull -0/-0/-0/-1/- 1/-2/-2/-4/Incapacitated, and decides that its stony brow acts as a ram which inflicts two points of Hull damage before extra successes.<br><br>
However, before that plan can go anywhere, Mnemon Valen’s player comes up with a more daring idea—since the behemoth seems to be headed in the same direction as the Circle, he wants to use harpoons and rope lines to attach the ship to the behemoth’s shell and ride it toward their destination, cutting down on travel time immensely! The Storyteller judges this a risky plan, likely to anger the behemoth, and decides will require tricky maneuvering to pull off. He decides the stratagem will use (Wits + Sail + Maneuverability), and cost 15 Momentum—it will, after all, resolve the encounter in one stroke and get the ship to its destination much faster.<br><br>
The players gather up the dice and begin getting their ship into position…</details>
