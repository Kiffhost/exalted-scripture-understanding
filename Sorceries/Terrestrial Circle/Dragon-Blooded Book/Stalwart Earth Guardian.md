Drawing a geometric figure in the soil or tracing it out on stone with chalk over the course of a few minutes, the sorcerer wards herself and her allies from harm. This figure spreads out to close range from its center. Characters within the ward gain +1 Defense and +1 Resolve against any attacks or other effects used on them from without. Characters outside the ward but within medium range of its center come under attack as the earth turns against them, an environmental hazard with difficulty (higher of Essence or Intelligence) and Damage 1B/round. Characters who fail a roll against the hazard treat moving through it as difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) for that round. In addition, the churning earth makes stealthy approaches all but impossible, increasing the mobility penalty of characters caught within it by âˆ’2 and making enough noise to awaken anyone sleeping inside the ward. 

A sorcerer with this as her control spell has a certain earthiness to her, smelling of plowed soil and loamy clay. She can use her fingernails to etch lines in stone, an exceptional tool (Exalted, p. 580) for Craft rolls to work stone or Linguistics rolls to inscribe writing on it. 
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 15):
Distorting this spell inverts the ward, nullifying its effects outside while causing those within to suffer the environmental hazard and mobility penalty.
