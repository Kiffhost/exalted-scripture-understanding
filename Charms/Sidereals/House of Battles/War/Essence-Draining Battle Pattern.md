*The Sidereal marshals her forces into an auspicious formation that dams, blocks, and diverts the flow of a puissant enemy’s [[Essence]].*
The Sidereal chooses a Charm or magical power possessed by an enemy. She can’t choose [[Excellencies]] or Permanent [[Charms]]. If an allied battle group crashes that enemy or deals decisive damage to him while he’s crashed, that effect is negated if it’s active and he can’t use it for the rest of the scene. 

## Special activation rules

The Sidereal can use this Charm reflexively when she or an allied battle group successfully defends against an attack or other danger enhanced by magic. She must name one of the powers used to enhance that attack for this Charm.
