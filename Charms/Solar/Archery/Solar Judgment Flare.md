The Exalt pours incandescent Solar Essence through her bow, firing a streaking shot of immolating flame. If the Solar has 15+ Initiative then she may use this Charm to unleash a horrific attack against opponents a minimum of three range bands away. If successful, this attack does (greater of Essence or three) automatic damage, and dice on the damage roll may be augmented at a rate of one mote per die, to a limit of (half current Initiative rounded up). Where this arrow strikes, it will send out a line of burning destruction, one range band for every five Initiative (rounded up). Everything caught in this burning nova swath takes damage; characters are subject to a high intensity (6L/round) bonfire, while scenery takes fiat levels of damage. A character struck with this attack is likewise flung backwards one range band for every three health levels lost from the attack. If a Solar uses this Charm against a ship made of natural materials, every three damage successes equals a point of hull damage. If she uses it against a battle group, they are automatically at -2 successes from their next rout check. Solar Judgment Flare can be used without an aim action.

### On Solar Judgment Flare

The backer is brand new to Exalted, so I had to help him find the exact right Charm. The first couple of Resistance Charms we worked on didnâ€™t feel right to his personality, so we scrapped them. Finally I asked him what characters he likes most, and he started to talk about an overpowered archer from Fate Stay/Night. I had known since the beginning that Archery yet needed an overpowered Charm, so I worked out this incredibly powerful mechanic. There may be yet be another upgrade to this Charm, one of unfathomable power. Backer: Maha
