Daring Venture’s golden bowstring vibrates with its progenitor’s beauty, giving a serene note that soothes wild beasts and calms the wounded. Add (higher of Essence or Occult) bonus dice on a Performance- or Presence-based roll to influence a wild beast, or on a Medicine roll. 

## Special activation rules

A Dragon-Blooded V’neef scion awakens this Evocation at no cost upon attuning to Daring Venture. 

## Resonant

A wielder who resonates with jade may use this Evocation reflexively to enhance any action taken by an animal familiar, or to add ([higher of Essence or Occult] / 2, rounded up) to her familiar’s Defense, Resolve, or Guile for one instant. This doesn’t stack with other effects that add dice or successes to the familiar’s roll.
