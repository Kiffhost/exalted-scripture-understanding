*The Sidereal shortens her allotted lifespan by a few days to suffuse her body with strength stolen from her future.*
The Sidereal gains up to (Essence) bonus dots of Strength, paying three motes per dot. This can raise her above Strength 5. If she’s unarmored, she adds +(Strength) soak, which includes these bonus dots.
Using this Charm slightly but permanently reduces the Sidereal’s lifespan. This doesn’t need to be tracked but can provide roleplaying opportunities.
## Special activation rules
The Sidereal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge when she uses Burn Life to reflexively activate a Form Charm.
