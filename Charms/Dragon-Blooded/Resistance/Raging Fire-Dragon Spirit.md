The Dragon-Blood unleashes the deepest flames of her vitality, awakening the deadly force of her inner fire. Her body becomes faster and stronger at the cost of risking exhaustion or death. She gains a bonus dot of [[Strength]], ignores a single point of wound penalty, and adds (lower of [[Essence]] or [[Stamina]]) bonus dice on all rolls she makes to attack, rush, or attempt a feat of strength. However, her [[Stamina]] doesnâ€™t add to her soak and she loses one point of [[Initiative]] at the end of each round.
