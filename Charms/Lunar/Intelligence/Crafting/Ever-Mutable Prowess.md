Receding into the depths of her protean nature, the Lunar discovers untapped potential. After five minutes of meditation or sleep, she may exchange craft points of one type for another. She may exchange silver for gold craft points at a rate of two to one, or exchange white for gold or gold for silver at a rate of one to two. Each activation only allows her to convert one type of craft points.
