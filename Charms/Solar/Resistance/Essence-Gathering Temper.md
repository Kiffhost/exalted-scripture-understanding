The Exalt is resistant to all forms of damage, and empowered by them. When an attack makes it through her defense, she may pay one [[Initiative]] to draw [[Essence]] from deep within the core of her body. The Exalt gains a number of motes equal to half the damage (round up) of the attack before soak, but may gain no more than ([[Stamina]]) motes in a single round. Once the Solar has used this Charm, she may not use it until it has been reset by soaking a withering attack of 10+ raw damage without suffering [[Initiative]] loss. At [[Resistance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3+, the total number of motes the Solar may gain per round increases to ([[Stamina]] x2).
