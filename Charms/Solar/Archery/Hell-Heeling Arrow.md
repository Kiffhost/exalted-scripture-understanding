*The Exalt gives her enemies a taste of her wrathful [[Essence]].*
As with [[Nova Arrow Attack]], she fires an explosive arrow into a range band at close range with an enemy. But instead of exploding on contact, the arrow sits and smokes and rumbles. Characters within short range of this arrow can feel their slightest movement causing it to agitate and surge with Solar anima; their barest shifts in posture threaten to cause an explosion. If it explodes, [[Hell-Heeling Arrow]] will hit everything in short range, and the only way to escape it is to successfully disengage — once if at short range, twice if at close. The difficulty of this roll is 5. If any character simply moves a range band (or gets moved), the arrow explodes, doing a non-standard decisive attack to all targets with an attack pool of ([[Essence]] + [[Initiative]]) dice (maximum 12), with a damage pool of ([[Initiative]]) dice. The blast from this explosion can only be dodged, and has the same knockdown rules as [[Nova Arrow Attack]]. In addition, characters knocked down by this attack are automatically lit on fire, suffering bonfire (4L/round) damage until they can put it out. [[Hell-Heeling Arrow]] does not reset the Solar’s [[Initiative]] to base. It can only be used once per battle, but may be reset by joining battle.

### On [[Hell-Heeling Arrow]]

Continuing to play up Archery’s theme of range band domination, a (sort of) converse of [[Searing Sunfire Interdiction]].
