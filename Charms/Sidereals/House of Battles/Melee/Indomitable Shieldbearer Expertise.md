*The Sidereal fights with a seasoned veteranâ€™s caution and restraint, avoiding the risks that cost callow troops their lives.*
The Sidereal reduces the [[Initiative]] cost of full defenses by one and can flurry them with nonattack actions, waiving the [[Defense]] penalty from flurries. If she wields a [[Shield]] weapon, she reduces the [[Initiative]] cost by two and may pay two motes to flurry a [[full defense]] with an attack.
