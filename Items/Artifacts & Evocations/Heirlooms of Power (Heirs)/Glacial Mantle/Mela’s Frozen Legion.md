Brings Death Glacial Mantle’s master blesses her soldiers with boreal might, encasing their weapons and armor in ice as strong as jade. She grants an allied battle group within medium range the following benefits:
 - They gain [[Might]] 1.
 - Their attacks gain +1 [[Accuracy]] and Overwhelming 5.
 - They gain +1 Parry. Fire-based attacks ignore this bonus.
 - They gain +2 armored soak and [[Hardness]] (her [[Intelligence]] + [[War]]). Fire-based attacks ignore this soak bonus and [[Hardness]].
If the wearer is fighting under a stratagem enacted with [[Winter Brings Death]], she can use this Evocation reflexively upon winning [[Join Battle]].
## Dissonant
This Evocation can’t be awakened by characters dissonant with [[Glacial Mantle]].
## Resonant
The enhanced battle group gains [[Might]] 2.
