*It is fortunate for the Infernal’s foes that she sometimes tires of them.*

The Infernal can throw a grappled enemy one range band back with a withering or decisive throw. Her target’s soak or Hardness is reduced by one for each round of control she has, even those over the limit on how many she can expend. On a withering throw, the damage bonus increases to +3 per round. On a decisive throw, she doubles 10s on the damage roll if she has at least three rounds, and doubles 9s with five rounds.

If the Infernal uses [[Unrelenting Hellbound Might#Behemoth-Wrestling Fury (Brawl 5, Essence 3, God-Strangling Attitude (Brawl 5, Essence 2) (+3m) God-Strangling Attitude )|Behemoth-Wrestling Fury]] to grapple a Legendary Size enemy, she can use [[Foe-Flung Doom]] to throw it unimpeded by its size. She doubles the soak or Hardness reduction against Legendary Size foes.

With Essence 3, the Infernal can expend two rounds of control to throw an enemy back two range bands damage as a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232. She can expend four rounds to throw an enemy three range bands back, dealing damage like a medium-range fall. These rounds of control don’t add damage or count toward this Charm’s other effects. This doesn’t stack with falling damage from [[Fists of the Old Ones]] and similar effects.
### Keys 
#### Fall to Ruin (Brawl 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)
The Infernal always doubles 10s on decisive damage rolls. She doubles 9s with at least three rounds and doubles 8 with six rounds. If she has six or more rounds of control, she doubles 8s. Once per scene, she can spend one Willpower to increase the doubling by one step, potentially doubling 7s. She can reset this by crashing a grappled enemy.
