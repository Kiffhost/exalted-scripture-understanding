Concealing her hostile intentions behind common, everyday movements, the stylist can strike without striking. After successfully landing a decisive attack, she forgoes making a damage roll and resetting to base Initiative. Even though the attack doesn’t deal any damage, it still conveys poisons applied to her weapon (Exalted, p. 232) and the deleterious effects of Charms, as long as they don’t directly enhance the damage roll. Noticing the attack requires a (Perception + Awareness roll) from all onlookers, including the victim, against a difficulty of (her Essence + Manipulation). If she attacked from concealment, it doesn’t break stealth, and she substitutes her total Stealth successes for the difficulty of the Awareness roll if they’re higher. 
## Mastery

An enemy struck by the attack takes a penalty of (the stylist’s Manipulation) on rolls to resist poison or other harmful effects conveyed through it.
