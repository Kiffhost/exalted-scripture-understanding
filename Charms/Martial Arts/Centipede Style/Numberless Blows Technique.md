Centering herself for a moment to perceive every possible angle of attack, the stylist unleashes countless strikes, her anima banner taking the form of many arms and legs to express the fullness of her prowess. When she uses Motion of Myriad Legs, she may pay a seven-mote, three-anima surcharge to add one to the maximum number of attacks she can make and add (Essence/2, rounded up) dice of damage to each attack. If she deals damage with at least two attacks before making the final attack, it’s unblockable. With three damaging attacks, the final attack becomes unblockable and undodgeable. With four damaging attacks, the final attack becomes an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). If the stylist savages a grappled enemy, she may expend up to (Strength) rounds of control, adding that many dice to the damage of each attack. 
## Mastery

Non-Excellency Charms need only have their cost paid once to apply to all attacks the stylist makes. 
## Terrestrial

This Charm can only be used against crashed enemies and can’t inflict ambushes. Falcon Style Falcon style is a high-flying art, its practitioners leaping across the battlefield to deliver powerful strikes or claim elevated vantages from which to deliver the finishing blow. In addition to attacks executed in midair, the style makes heavy use of grappling, locking enemies into painful submission holds or throwing them to the ground before executing punishing follow-ups. Its techniques areshowyandspectacular,andmanyFalconstylistsdraw flocks of bystanders to their fights — whether they’re wandering folk heroes or ruthlessly dishonorable brutes. Falcon style is most prominent in the South, although iconic masters have spread it to other directions. Falcon Weapons: Falcon style’s unarmed attacks use all four limbs and headbutts. It’s compatible with the cestus, iron boots, tiger claws, and medium or heavy improvised weapons that deal bashing damage. Unarmed attacks enhanced by Falcon Charms can be stunted to deal lethal damage. Armor: Falcon style is compatible with light armor.
