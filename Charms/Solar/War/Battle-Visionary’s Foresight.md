The Solar taps a legacy of war greater and longer than the length of her life. Her battle-hardened visage stares into the Essence of the world through ancient eyes, seeing primal battles play out in ages lost. This Charm is used during strategic warfare, and requires one to five minutes to complete—the Solar concentrates on her foe, her army, the battlefield, and her memories, merging them into a single interlinked tactic that allows her to create a perfect response to enemy stratagems. The player privately chooses two stratagems (p. 212) and writes them down, not revealing them to fellow players. The selected tactics are hidden face down. If the opposing player wins the Strategic Maneuver roll and chooses to employ one of the strategies the Solar’s player has selected, the enemy finds that his stratagem has led him into a terrible mistake: the Solar general is ready with a perfect counter-tactic. In this case, treat the battle as if the Exalt’s player had won the strategic roll and deployed a stratagem of equal value to the one she just countered. The Solar’s player may also choose stratagems that are listed in later publications. Opposing players may not opt to choose “No stratagem.” However, armies led by the Chosen may gain access to special, mystical stratagems, such as the divine miracles allowed by the Chosen of Battles. Such tactics are rare, and upon encountering one, the Solar may trade two prepared tactics to counter one of these reflexively. 

Snake Style Snake style is swift and agile, moving with the speed of a striking serpent to fell stronger or better-armed foes before they even have a chance to act. Its strikes emphasize precision over brute strength, and a master of the style can pierce through armor, paralyze an enemy with a pressure-point strike, or even deliver poisonous Essence through her fingertips. It flourishes in dojos of the South and the East, where students learn to emulate the motion and tactics of the native serpents, but as one of the ancient animal styles whose lineage dates back to the First Age, its practitioners can be found throughout all of Creation. Snake Weapons: Snake style’s unarmed attacks are usually two-fingered fang attacks that stab at pressure points and exposed tendons. It can also be used armed with a sevensection staff or hooked sword, which are wielded with extraordinary speed and finesse. Any unarmed attack enhanced by a Snake Charm can always be stunted to deal lethal damage. Armor: Snake style is compatible with light armor.
