The earth shakes and rumbles like a bucking stallion when White Lizard’s Tongue strikes it, sending the wielder’s enemies into upheaval. She makes an unblockable decisive attack roll against all enemies standing on the same surface as her within medium range. All hit enemies fall prone. If any hit enemies carry brands, the wielder also divides her Initiative among them evenly to determine the decisive damaged rolled against them, adding an additional (Charisma) dice against each. The wielder’s Initiative only resets if she makes at least one damage roll against a branded target. Stone and stronger substances aren’t damaged by the shockwave, but soil, wood, or the like may be, creating difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) at the Storyteller’s discretion.
This Evocation can only be used once per scene, unless reset by branding a nontrivial foe or crashing a branded foe.
## Dissonant
The attack is limited to short range.
## Resonant
Against characters that aren’t branded, this attack still deals (Charisma) dice of decisive damage.
