*In search of lovely and gentle music, the necromancer croons a prayerful melody to the Seven Sighs Requiem, borrowing sublime performers from its soul-menagerie for a night of revels.*
The necromancer must begin her song after nightfall, singing for a few minutes to call forth a band of ancient shades to perform during the night’s revels. Eccentrically dressed, each musician’s mouth is sown shut with strings of sinew, and each carries an instrument of the necromancer’s choice. They raise a black metal flagpole with a banner of pale blue flame where they set up, visible and enticing to the dead for miles around. The musicians are noncombatants (Exalted, p. 208) and dematerialized, though visible and audible.
Those who hear the musician’s song gain a Minor Principle of joie de vivre and join in the night’s revels.
Sublime music makes ghosts feel as if they live once more for the night, they may interact with the living as if material at the party. The intoxicating atmosphere inflicts a −2 emotional penalty to the [[Guile]] of the necromancer’s guests. Negative Ties towards the necromancer possessed by the celebrants have their intensity lowered by one step as they celebrate.
When the next morning comes, trivial revelers can no longer recall the night’s events, as if they were a dream. Nontrivial characters may roll ({[[Stamina]] or [[Wits]]} + [[Integrity]]) against a difficulty of 3 to recall the details of the necromancer’s party.
## Control
The sublime performers float on a stage of mist as they perform, led by a standard-bearer holding their flag aloft. The necromancer’s party becomes mobile, traveling as a night-parade at her beckoning. The spell’s effects extend out to medium range around the stage.
## Distortion (10)
Distortion causes the performers to become material, rendering them vulnerable to attack. Should they or their banner be struck, the spell’s effects come to an end.
