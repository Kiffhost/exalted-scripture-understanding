Skulking Rat Spirit Plucking a hair from her head, shedding a tear, or spitting on the ground, the Lunar transforms a cast-off piece of her body into a duplicate. She creates a copy of her current form within close range, complete with convincing (if non-functional) duplicates of her equipment. It lacks true intelligence or agency, and can’t make actions requiring rolls, but it’s a realistic imitation of her. It can’t move beyond medium range from the Lunar; doing so causes it to revert to whatever it was created from. The duplicate uses the Lunar’s [[Defense|Evasion]], [[Defense|Parry]], and [[Guile]]. If hit by an attack, it dissipates in a silver flash. Characters with superhuman or magically enhanced senses can roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against its [[Guile]] to identify it as a fake. Additionally, the duplicate’s limited ability to carry on conversation means that characters who converse with it for a few minutes can identify it as false with a successful read intentions roll. Using this Charm lets the Lunar reflexively roll [[Stealth]] to enter concealment, even without a hiding place. Enemies whose opposed rolls fail believe she’s the duplicate and the duplicate is her, although they can see through this concealment if they subsequently identify the duplicate as false. This Charm can be stacked to create up to ([[Essence]] + 5) total duplicates. Activations past the first costs one mote.
