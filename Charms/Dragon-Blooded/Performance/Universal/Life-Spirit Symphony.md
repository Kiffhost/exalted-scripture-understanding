Nature dances, exultant, to the Dragon-Blood’s performance. Flowers blossom from her footsteps, vines twist and coil with her rhythm, and thorns turn away from harming her. As long as the Exalt continues to perform, she and all allies within medium range can ignore difficult terrain based on foliage or vegetation, its movements opening a path to let them through. Whenever a plant-based environmental hazard or poison threatens those allies, she may roll (Charisma + Performance). They can use the result of her roll in place of their own rolls to resist the hazard or poison. The Dragon-Blood can take other actions while continuing the performance by flurrying them with a miscellaneous action to continue performing. If she wishes, she may use her miscellaneous action to direct vines and plants to attack an enemy within medium range, rolling a difficulty 4 gambit with (Charisma + Performance). Success ensnares him in vines, preventing him from taking any movement actions until he or one of his allies clears them with a difficulty 3 gambit using an edged weapon. Even after they’re hacked away, they linger on as difficult terrain beneath his feet. This Charm can only be used once per day.
