*The Infernal salivates greedily in anticipation of meals yet to come.*

When the Infernal rolls Join Battle against at least one enemy she’s capable of eating, she adds (Essence/2, rounded up) non-Charm dice. She ignores deprivation penalties, adding them as non-Charm dice instead, maximum (Perception or Stamina).

The Infernal banks a pool of Initiative equal to the 10s on her roll, which lasts for the rest of the scene. If she has an applicable Intimacy of hunger, she gains (Intimacy) additional Initiative. This is tracked separately from her own Initiative, and can’t be targeted by withering attacks. The Infernal can only use this Initiative to contribute to the damage of decisive attacks against enemies she can eat.
