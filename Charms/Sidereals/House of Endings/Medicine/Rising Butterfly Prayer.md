*Reciting a short homily, the Sidereal commends a deceased’s soul to an auspicious reincarnation, burning silk memoranda addressed to Taru-Han, Lady of Souls, and Wayang, head of the Division of Endings.*
The Sidereal must use this Charm at a funereal ritual for the deceased or the site of his remains within three days of his death. Doing so lodges a formal request that his soul receive a relatively peaceful and pleasant life in his next reincarnation. This request requires the participation of multiple Bureaus and destiny planning is only so accurate, but Heaven will make meaningful efforts to assure him a favorable reincarnation.
Once per day, using this Charm for someone the Sidereal has a positive Tie toward awards her one Willpower. If it was a Major or Defining Tie, she also loses one Limit.
