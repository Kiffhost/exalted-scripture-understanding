*All of existence is a weapon to an opened mind.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have [[Mind-Hand Manipulation]] active. She makes a withering or decisive attack by shaping dangerous phenomena into reality: pulses of disintegrating white fire, lightning, grinding earth, boiling acid mist, low-frequency screams that split organs, or new colours of light that erase mass. These count as telekinetic attacks made through [[Mind-Hand Manipulation]].

The Infernal can choose to make the attack unblockable or undodgeable, based on the form her manifestation takes, or she can double 9s on the attack roll. The attack gains any weapon tags suitable to the particular manifestation chosen by the Infernal (Exalted, pp. 585-586). Withering attacks double up to (Willpower/2, rounded up) attack roll extra successes when determining their raw damage. Decisive attacks double 10s on their damage roll, and can deal aggravated damage if the manifested danger exploits a logical weakness of the target.

An enemy killed by a decisive attack can be transmuted into inanimate matter, though not anything with a [[Resources]] value greater than (Infernal’s Essence). An eerie metal fog might turn its victims into statues of tarnished gold — or untarnished, for higher-Essence Infernals.
## [[Keys]]
#### Counter-Conceptual Interposition (+3m)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote surcharge to clash an attack with a defensive manifestation: crystalline orbs that shatter into ripples of bent space, concussive thunderclaps, geometric mandalas of impossibly-coloured tiles. She can clash with either a withering or a decisive attack, but either way, she can’t deal more than (Essence) damage. She doesn’t gain Initiative from a withering attack.
