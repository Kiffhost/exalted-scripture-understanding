*A fine patina of blue-green tarnish spreads across the Infernal’s body like mold, flaking away to reveal shining brass etched with maddening spiral patterns and tales of the Yozis’ glory.*

The Infernal creates artifact armor from Essence and dons it instantly. The type of armor created and its appearance are the same each time she uses this Charm. She adds her wound penalty to the armor’s Hardness, to a maximum bonus of (Stamina). Characters literate in Old Realm who study the sagas etched into the armor treat them as exceptional equipment for Lore and Occult rolls involving demons, the Yozis, or the history of Hell.

The Infernal may fuse her [[Viridian Legend Exoskeleton]] with any artifact armor she’s currently wearing, enjoying the best of both armors’ traits and applying this Charm’s benefits to her armor. Artifact armor’s attunement cost is waived for this Charm’s duration, releasing the committed motes.

With Essence 3, this Charm’s duration becomes Indefinite.
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively upon entering [[Devil-Body]], waiving its mote cost. This doesn’t receive the increased duration at Essence 3.
## [[Keys]]
#### Brazen Hell-Chariot Carapace
If the Infernal uses this Charm while mounted, she can extend the armor to her steed as barding, using the same rules as above. This adds +3 to the difficulty of unhorse gambits against her.
#### Demon-King Mythos Etchings
The Infernal awakens an Evocation for her armor. Its themes and functions derive from the Infernal’s personality, Caste, iconic anima banner, and any Yozis that she feels a strong affinity for. This key can be purchased any number of times.
