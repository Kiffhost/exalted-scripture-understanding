*This Evocation is a gambit against an undead whose [[Essence]] rating doesn’t exceed (the wielder’s [[Essence]] + 2), banishing it into the shadow-world hidden within [[Asphodel]] to be dealt with by the prince in the jewel as he sees fit.*
The gambit’s difficulty is (the higher of the target’s !!EssenceorResolve).Banishingatrulypuissantbeing,such!! as a nephwrack, could conceivably result in it overthrowing Shou Ren and claiming the hidden world for itself. Undead Exalted and [[Deathlords]] are immune to this Evocation, as are any undead the Storyteller deems uniquely powerful. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used against an enemy in [[Initiative]] Crash. 

## Resonant

Successfully banishing an undead awards one point of [[Willpower]] to the wielder.
