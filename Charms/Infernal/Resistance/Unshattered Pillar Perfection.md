*The Infernal remains unmoved by the fervour and folly of an unenlightened world.*

For an instant, the Infernal can’t be physically moved, whether by smash attacks, a grappler’s throw, [[Heaven Thunder Hammer]] (Exalted, p. 274), etc. This can’t prevent falls due to gravity. It can be used after an attack roll, but before damage. If an enemy uses applicable magic after damage is rolled, this Charm may be used at that time.

This Charm’s cost is waived while the Infernal is meditating. However, if she violates one of her Defining Principles, she can’t use this Charm for the rest of the scene unless she pays one Willpower.
## [[Keys]]
#### Infernal Omphalos Meditation (Resistance 4, Essence 2) (+2m)
The Infernal may pay a two-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene. It ends if she violates a Defining Principle.
#### Sky-Piercing Spear Enlightenment ([[#Infernal Omphalos Meditation (Resistance 4, Essence 2) (+2m)|Infernal Omphalos Meditation]])
When the Infernal uses [[#Infernal Omphalos Meditation (Resistance 4, Essence 2) (+2m)|Infernal Omphalos Meditation]], she can prevent a fall due to gravity or the like, remaining suspended in midair. Once the Charm ends, she falls to the ground with a heavy impact, but is undisturbed by it — unless she ended it by violating a Principle, in which case she takes falling damage as usual.
