*As the Frost-Thorn Knuckles’ icy talons impale the wielder’s prey, they burst into an internal blizzard, piercing him with deadly icicle spears.*
This Evocation enhances a withering attack against a prone enemy, adding ([[Strength]]) to its Overwhelming rating. Alternatively, when she triggers [[Ravening Fimbulwinter Approach]], she may enhance it with this Evocation, making a withering attack in place of a decisive one. If her enemy is crashed by this attack, he suffers an additional ([[Strength]]) dice of decisive lethal damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. If the total levels of lethal damage exceed the target’s [[Essence]] rating, then the wielder freezes limbs or organs solid before shattering them with this attack, converting some or all of the attack’s damage into a crippling injury chosen by the attacker (Exalted, p. 201). This doesn’t count against the usual once-per-story limit on taking crippling injuries.
[[Blizzard Claw Swipe]] can only be used once per day. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with moonsilver cannot awaken this Evocation. 

## Resonant

The wielder gains one Willpower if she crashes her enemy.
