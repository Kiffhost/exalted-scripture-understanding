*The Lunar is the last thing her unwary prey ever sees.*
She makes a decisive ambush against an enemy, assuming she meets the normal requirements to do so (Exalted, p. 203), adding attack roll extra successes as dice on the damage roll.

In animal shapes with [[Ambush]] Hunter, the Lunar doubles 9s on the attack roll.
