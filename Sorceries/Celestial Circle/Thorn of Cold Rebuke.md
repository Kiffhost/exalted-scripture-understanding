Pursing her lips, the sorcerer exhales a puff of shimmering mist that condenses into a javelin of ice. She hurls it at a point within long range, shattering into a burst of icy blue mist. She rolls an unblockable (Dexterity + Thrown) decisive attack, adding (Occult) dice, against everyone within medium range of the spear’s impact. It deals (Intelligence) dice of lethal damage to those hit, ignoring Hardness, and the sorcerer divides her Initiative evenly among all of them, rounding up, on top of this. Battle groups instead take (sorcerer’s Intelligence + Initiative) dice of damage, without counting against her total Initiative. For (Essence) hours thereafter, an eerie cold fills the area, a difficulty (sorcerer’s Intelligence), Damage 1B/hour hazard. Exposed surfaces freeze over for the duration, becoming difficult terrain and imposing a –3 penalty on balance-related rolls. Bodies of water freeze into icebergs and floes, which are naval hazards (Exalted, p. 244) requiring a single roll at difficulty (sorcerer’s Intelligence); failure inflicts one Hull damage and leaves the ship immobilized, requiring it to be broken free before it can move. These can dam all but Creation’s widest rivers. A sorcerer may withhold the Thorn, wielding it as a spear (Accuracy +3; Damage 12L/4; Defense +1; Tags: Lethal, Melee, Thrown (Short), Piercing). She can use her entire turn to make a decisive attack that shatters the spear and unleashes a freezing vapor, as per the spell’s primary effect. A sorcerer with this as her control spell may extend its effects to (Essence) days. Treat wood and water spirits as having a Minor Tie of fear toward her, cowed by her wintry presence. While she wields the Thorn, it’s exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for intimidating them.
