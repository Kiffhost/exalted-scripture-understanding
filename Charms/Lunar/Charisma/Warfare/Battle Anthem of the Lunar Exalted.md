Her rage too great for a single soul to contain, the Lunar weaves her fury into song. All allies that can hear her add a bonus die on withering and decisive damage rolls. They treat rage-based Intimacies relevant to the current fight as one level of intensity stronger; Defining Intimacies instead elevate their modifier to +5 or −4. Allied battle groups add (lower of Essence or Performance) dice on attack rolls and rout checks. While using this Charm, the Lunar can’t take non-reflexive actions.
