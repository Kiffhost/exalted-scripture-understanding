*Hatred binds rider and mount together as one, a terrible storm of steel riding down their fear prey.*
The Abyssal can pay a three-mote surcharge when she uses [[Soul Reins]] (p. XX) to grant her steed artifact heavy barding (Exalted, p. 203) matching the style of the Nemesis Cuirass. The steed gains all of her negative Ties as long as that Charm is active. The deathknight can use the Cuirass’ [[Evocations]] on her steed’s behalf.
Awakening: This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience. It awakens for free upon the Abyssal meeting its prerequisites.
