As the Lunar’s blood is shed, she changes it into a poisonous spray. After an attack deals decisive damage to her from close range, she may use this Charm to counterattack with an unblockable decisive attack, rolling ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). She adds her wound penalty in non-Charm dice to this roll, rather than subtracting. Success exposes her enemy to a dose of Adder Fang Method’s venom. This doesn’t deal damage or reset the Lunar’s [[Initiative]]. If the Lunar knows [[Acid-Spitting Attack]], she may instead change her blood to acid, dealing ([[Essence]]) dice of aggravated damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. Her attacker’s soak and [[Hardness]] suffer a penalty equal to the levels of damage dealt until his next turn. 
## Protean 

In venomous or poisonous shapes, the Lunar may counterattack with a dose of that animal’s poison, adding ([[Essence]]) to its duration. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is venomous or poisonous may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm.
