Seizing on the chaos of the battlefield, the Lunar tempts the rank and file of enemy armies away from their banners. Before an enemy battle group rolls a rout check, she makes a ([[Manipulation]] + [Presence or War]) roll against its [[Resolve]]. If she succeeds and the battle group suffers dissolution (Exalted, p. 209), it reforms under her command, losing a dot of [[Size]]. Deserters, mercenaries, and ill-treated troops turn to the Lunar’s side, believing she offers the best chance for survival, while those who refuse to turn traitor make up the lost dot of [[Size]]. Once the battle ends, the battle group’s members form a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the Lunar, with a Storytellerchosen emotional context. This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset when a battle group acting under the Lunar’s order action deals enough damage to an enemy battle group to reduce its [[Size]].
