*Where the Abyssal treads, even sound dies.*
The Abyssal becomes perfectly silent for a single [[Stealth]] roll, causing opposed rolls to fail automatically if they’re solely based on hearing. Alternatively, she can silence a physical action using any Ability, making it impossible to detect with hearing. This doesn’t silence indirect consequences of the action, like a rotten timber collapsing under the Abyssal’s weight.
While using [[Imperceptible Phantom Embodiment]] to render herself imperceptible to hearing, the Abyssal can also use this Charm to add ([[Essence]], maximum 5) non-Charm dice on a [[Stealth]] roll, as long as her stunt involves her eerie silence.
