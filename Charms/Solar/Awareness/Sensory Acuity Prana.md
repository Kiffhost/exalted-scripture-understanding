*A breath of [[Essence]] seals the five senses into a more perfect form.*
The Solar’s senses are heightened and attuned to minute motions and sounds, dim and noisy conditions. She can differentiate between subtle tastes and textures with only the slightest variation. Thus sharpened, it is more difficult for characters to escape her notice, or to deceive her hunting senses. For the rest of the scene, the Exalt’s [[Awareness]] rolls benefit from double 9s. If the effect of any Unsurpassed (Sense) Discipline applies, reroll 6s until they cease to appear. Use of [[Sensory Acuity Prana]] comes without the danger of sensory overload; the Charm helps the Solar manage her senses more effectively.
