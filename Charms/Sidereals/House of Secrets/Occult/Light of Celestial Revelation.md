*The Sidereal reveals subtle realms to mortal eyes.*
While using Mark of Exaltation, the Sidereal can reflexively pay two motes to make its revealing radiance visible to others. Until her next turn, dematerialized characters within short range of her are rendered visible to everyone. This makes the Sidereal’s Caste mark visible to all who can see it.
Additionally, while using that effect, the Sidereal can take a miscellaneous action to focus the light on a dematerialized character within long range, rolling (Perception + Occult) to render him visible to others as well.
With an Occult 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay a two-mote surcharge when she uses Mark of Exaltation to gain the above benefit for that Charm’s duration. Any characters revealed by the Charm remain exposed for its duration.
