*This azure blue stone has a small white swirl on one side.*
It ensures that all winds within three miles of this stone blow in the direction the swirl is facing. The wind blows no harder or softer than normal, but always blows in the correct direction. If someone changes the stoneâ€™s orientation, the direction of the wind shifts gradually over the next 15 minutes until it blows in the new direction.
