*The Solar’s keen eyes burn through deception.*
This Charm enhances [[All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight]], aiding the Solar in an attempt to see through magical disguises, shapeshifting, or any other magic which allows a character— even another Exalt—to appear to be something or someone other than who he is. This Charm makes it possible to notice such effects with [[Awareness]], adding the Solar’s [[Essence]] in automatic successes to the attempt. For the difficulty of seeing through disguises, see page 224. Unless stated otherwise, seeing through all other kinds of magical identity-deceptions is a difficulty 5 feat.
