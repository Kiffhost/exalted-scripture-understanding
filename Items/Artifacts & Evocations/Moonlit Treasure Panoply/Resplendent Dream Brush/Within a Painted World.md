Drawing the [[Resplendent Dream Brush]] across a painting, the artist steps into a new world.
The Lunar can use [[Crossing Midnight’s Threshold]] on a painting — one of her own or another artist’s — to transform it into a dream-realm. Anyone can freely enter or leave the painting through its frame while the Charm remains active. The Lunar doesn’t need to meditate to sustain the painted world.
The painting-world can only hold ([[Essence]] + [[Craft]] [Painting]) people, but it seems far larger than that to those within it, a sprawling landscape rendered in the painting’s style. Their unique perspective of the painting lets them make read intentions rolls to discern its artist’s Intimacies at the time he painted it and [[Awareness]] and [[Investigation]] rolls to notice otherwise-imperceptible details of the painting’s creation or subsequent treatment. Such rolls receive the Charm’s exceptional equipment bonus.
If the painter is a sorcerer, she waives the experience cost of workings she performs within the painted world. However, such workings have no power or effect outside the painting. The Storyteller may retroactively charge a player experience if a working somehow ends up circumventing this restriction.
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the artist can pay a five-mote surcharge to create a larger painting-world, capable of holding ten times as many people as normal.

## Special activation rules
If the Lunar knows [[Secure Den Technique]] (Lunars, p. 293), she can use it reflexively to confer its benefits on the painting-world. She doesn’t need to roll.
