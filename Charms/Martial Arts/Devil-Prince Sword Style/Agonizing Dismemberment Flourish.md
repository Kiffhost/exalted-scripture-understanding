*Fear becomes fatal as the Devil-Prince severs her victim’s limbs just as surely as she breaks his spirit.*

The stylist can use this Charm after a successful disarm or distract gambit. She rolls one die of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness, plus an additional die for each extra success on the gambit’s Initiative roll. If her target has a craven Intimacy, she adds (Intimacy) additional dice.

The stylist’s victim may commit in advance to accepting the highest level of crippling injury possible to prevent this damage (Exalted, p. 201). If he doesn’t, the stylist adds three automatic successes on this damage roll, or (Intimacy + 3) successes if her target has a [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven Intimacy]]. This doesn’t count against the once-per-story limit on taking crippling injuries, and doing so renders her victim immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene.

The stylist can also use this Charm after dealing 3+ decisive damage with [[Promise of a Red Future]], treating levels of damage over three on the initial damage as extra successes to determine how many additional dice she rolls.

This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived against trivial characters, who have no choice but to take a crippling injury.
### Mastery
The stylist gains one Willpower if this incapacitates her enemy or he takes a crippling injury. Trivial enemies don’t provide this bonus.
### Terrestrial
This can only be used against enemies with Major or Defining [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven intimacies]]. The stylist can’t add more than (Essence) extra successes as dice of damage.
