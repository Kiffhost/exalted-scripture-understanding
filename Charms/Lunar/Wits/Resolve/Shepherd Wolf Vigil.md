*The Lunar claims peoples and nations as her chosen pack, and woe to those who’d harm them.*
When she uses [[True-to-the-Pack Dedication]] or similar [[Wits]] [[Charms]] that rely on positive Ties to individuals, she may invoke positive Ties toward cultures as well. If the Lunar has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward a culture ruled by her Solar mate, she gains +1 [[Resolve]] against influence opposing that [[Intimacy|Tie]].
