*Like blood seeping into the earth, the deathknight’s malevolence suffuses her organization.*
When the Abyssal uses [[Accursed Overlord Authority]] with a negative Tie toward an individual, she may proclaim that individual an enemy of the organization. She senses whenever an organization member encounters her enemy, discerning the location of the encounter and the approximate distance and direction there. This doesn’t reveal the nature of the encounter or the identity of the group members involved.
With [[Essence]] 4, the Abyssal can use this with negative Ties toward groups, letting her sense when one of her organization’s members encounters someone acting in their official capacity within the enemy group.
