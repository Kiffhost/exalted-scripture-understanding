*The Abyssal melts into the air, becoming nothing more than dark, chill fog.*
The Abyssal dissolves into a cloud of fog with the following effects
- She gains +2 Evasion. With an appropriate stunt, she can dodge undodgeable attacks.
- She can’t take physical actions except for dodging, Stealth rolls, and movement actions, as well as Charms like Breath-Seizing Mist that are explicitly compatible. She’s still able to speak.
- In combat, she can move two range bands on her turn as an action that can’t be flurried. She can do so reflexively on the turn she uses this Charm.
- She can hover up to close range above the ground, letting her float over difficult terrain and certain environmental hazards unimpeded.
She can’t cross running water.
- She can pass through doors, walls, and other obstructions as long as they aren’t airtight or magically warded against such intrusion.
- She’s immune to decisive damage unless its source is enhanced by magic, based on heat or cold, or benefits from an appropriate stunt. Even then, decisive damage rolls against her subtracts (Essence) successes unless they’re based on heat or cold.
- Grappling her is impossible without appropriate magic.
The Abyssal must pay one Initiative at the start of each of her subsequent turns, or this Charm ends. It also ends if she’s crashed.
