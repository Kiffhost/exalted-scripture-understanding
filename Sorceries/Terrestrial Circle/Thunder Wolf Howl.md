White winds swirl around the sorcerer as she draws forth the ancient echo of a slain behemoth’s deathhowl. The sorcerer designates a point within medium range as the center of a deafening thunderclap that extends out to short range from that point. Characters caught within it, including allies, roll (Stamina + Resistance) at a difficulty of (the sorcerer’s higher of Essence or Intelligence). Battle groups suffer a penalty of (their Size). Characters who fail suffer base decisive damage of (Essence)B, ignoring Hardness, and the sorcerer divides her Initiative evenly among them, rounding up, to determine the total damage rolled against them. As long as one character fails his roll, the sorcerer resets to base Initiative. A character that takes damage is deafened (Exalted, p. 198) until he receives medical treatment, and suffers a crippling penalty on all actions equal to the number of 10s on the damage roll. This penalty falls by one at the end of each of that character’s turns. Objects and structures made of wood, glass, and similarly flimsy or fragile material suffer damage at the Storyteller’s discretion. 

A sorcerer with this as her control spell increases the difficulty and base damage of this spell by one each. When overcome with strong emotion, her voice booms and echoes like the peal of distant thunder.
