The clashing steel and ferocious blows of the swordsman’s enemies do not disrupt her focus—rather, she welcomes them, gleaning the weaknesses of each foe’s fighting style from their offense. After successfully parrying an attack, the stylist can use Gathering Light Concentration to reverse the onslaught penalties inflicted by it. Instead of applying them to her Defense, she applies them to her attacker’s Defense until his next turn. 
## Mastery
At Essence 3+, the Solar may spend an extra 3i when activating Gathering Light Concentration to cancel all onslaught penalties she’s suffering from, and inflict them on her attacker.
