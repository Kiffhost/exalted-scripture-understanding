Like a spider, the mutant can spin lines of adhesive silk.
These are exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580) for weaving, climbing, laying snares, swinging between handholds, etc. They’re also exceptional equipment for lifting or suspending heavy objects — a feat of strength rolled with ([[Stamina]] + applicable [[Craft]]), using (higher of [[Stamina]] or [[Craft]]) instead of [[Strength]] to determine if the feat can be attempted.
The mutant can make ranged attacks with webbing.
They’re light weapons with the Bashing, [[Thrown]] (Short), Disarming, Flexible, [[Grappling]], and Subtle tags. If she’s grappling an enemy from beyond close range, she can only take restrain or drag actions, and a character can sever the thread — ending the grapple — with a difficulty 3 gambit.
