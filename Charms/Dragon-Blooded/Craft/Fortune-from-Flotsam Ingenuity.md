The Dragon-Blood’s fluid ingenuity adapts to her circumstances, turning whatever materials she can find into exactly what she needs. This Charm is a (Wits + Craft) roll to undertake a major project in a matter of seconds, jury-rigging it together. It can even be used in combat on the Dragon-Blood’s turn. The Charm’s cost replaces the normal craft point cost of the project. The Dragon-Blood can accomplish projects that would normally be impossible in the brief instant she uses this Charm, whether it’s fletching enough arrows to supply an army in a whirling maelstrom of craftsmanship, or lashing together a raft from palm trees in a single flowing motion. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset when the Dragon-Blood or one of her Hearthmates achieves a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) with the assistance of an object that the Exalt crafted this story.
