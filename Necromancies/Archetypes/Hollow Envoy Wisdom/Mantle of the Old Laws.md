Ghosts perceive the character as a keeper of the Old Laws, which she may leverage as a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of trust and respect. Once per session, she may declare her title or deeds to treat this as a Major Tie instead. If she willingly betrays an undead being, she loses the benefits of this Merit until she undertakes a life-changing task (Exalted, p. 216) to demonstrate her contrition or rededication.
