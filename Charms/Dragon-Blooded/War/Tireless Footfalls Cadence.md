Earth Essence sustains the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s soldiers as they march in steady, rhythmic unison. She ignores penalties from troop fatigue or movement through strenuous environments on a Strategic Maneuver roll. If she defeats the opposing general on the roll and implements her stratagem, allied battle groups ignore fatigue-based penalties for the duration of the fight.
