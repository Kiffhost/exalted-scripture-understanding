Moving around fields, roads, and even inside buildings isn’t normally that difficult—at least not compared to climbing over deadfalls, slogging through thigh-high water, trudging across muddy swamps, or advancing through prepared fortifications. Deep snow, thick foliage, and panicked crowds may also constitute difficult terrain, at Storyteller discretion. 

Using a [[Move]] action to travel through a band of difficult terrain takes two move actions rather than one. Difficult terrain may also be used to model objects which will force a character to make a significant detour in order to advance or retreat from another character—for example, if a character’s enemy is on the other side of a locked building, the Storyteller may decide to declare the building difficult terrain—the extra time needed to advance on the opponent will represent time spent going around the building, rather than through it. 

Attempts to [[Rush]], [[Disengage]], or [[Withdraw]] across difficult terrain suffer a -3 penalty; by contrast, difficult terrain is often very easy to [[Take Cover]] in.
