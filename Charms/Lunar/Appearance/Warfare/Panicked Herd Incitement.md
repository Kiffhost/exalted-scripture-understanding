Radiating bestial menace, the Lunar sows fear through the ranks. When an enemy battle group that can see her makes an (Attribute + Ability) roll, it takes a −(her [[Appearance]] − its [[Resolve]]) penalty, minimum −1. If the roll fails, the battle group loses one Magnitude as terrified soldiers break away. 
## Protean 

In shapes that most of the battle group’s members have a Major or Defining Tie of fear toward, this Charm subtracts successes instead of dice. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
