*The Abyssal draws her wounds inwards, casting them into the void at the heart of her [[Essence]].*
The Abyssal speeds her natural healing (Exalted, p. 173). After an hour spent resting or meditating, she rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). For the rest of the day, her healing’s rate is multiplied by ([[Essence]] x successes).
Alternatively, when a character rolls to use [[Flesh-Mending Discipline]] or similar magic to heal the Abyssal’s damage, she can add her successes to his roll.
