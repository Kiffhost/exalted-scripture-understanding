*The Dreaming Pearl Courtesan embodies grace and beauty even in the midst of bloodshed, weaving through melee as if dancing through steps of a ballroom waltz, cutting down foes with gestures so delicate they can scarcely be noticed.*
The martial artist may make attacks out to short range, slashing a fan to unleash a razor-edged wind, letting a silk sash flow like a weaving serpent to strike enemies, or sending needles of nacreous Essence spiking from her fingernails. Any clothing she enchants with Pearlescent Filigree Defense gains the traits of light artifact armor, while weapons readied with Elegant Weapon Repertoire gain light artifact traits. 
## Special activation rules

Whenever the martial artist successfully disengages with 5+ successes, she may reflexively activate Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form.
