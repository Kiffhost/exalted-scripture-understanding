The sledge is a two-handed mace or hammer whose powerful strikes are slow and unwieldy. Like maces, many sledges are elaborately decorated. Their huge heads are often carved with battle scenes or fabulous beasts. The tetsubo, favored by pragmatists for its simpler construction, is a massive war-club studded with iron knobs.
