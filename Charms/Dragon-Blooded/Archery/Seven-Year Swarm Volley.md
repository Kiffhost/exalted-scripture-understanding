*The Terrestrial’s hands move to swiftly nock and draw as Wood [[Essence]] strengthens her sinew and toughens her ligaments.*
She makes ({lower of [[Dexterity]] or Perception} / 2, rounded up) decisive attacks distributed against one or more enemies. Each attack has a base damage of ([[Essence]] − 2), and she divides her [[Initiative]] evenly among each of them, rounded up, to determine their total damage. Once she’s completed these attacks, she resets to base [[Initiative]], even if they all missed.
