*Water darkens and hisses as the Infernal imbues it with the semblance of life. It swells and coagulates into gelatinous, green-black tentacles.*

The Infernal creates a tentacle out of a liquid within medium range. While the tentacles can be monstrously large, only a small amount of liquid is needed: a cup of tea, a puddle, blood shed on the battlefield, etc.

The tentacle is an extension of the Infernal’s will. She can use her actions to attack enemies with it, striking out to short range, rolling (Wits + {Occult or Sail}). The tentacles have Accuracy +3, Damage (10 + Wits)B, Overwhelming (Essence + 1), and the Flexible, Grappling, and Reaching tags. The damage doesn’t include the Infernal’s Strength.

If the Infernal makes a grapple gambit with the tentacles, she rolls (Wits + {Occult or Sail}) for the control roll. Success pulls the target into close range. The penalties for grappling apply only to the tentacle itself and to any actions the Infernal takes while using it.

The tentacle has (Infernal’s Essence + 5) −0 health levels, (Essence + 5) soak, and Hardness (Essence + 2). Its Evasion and Parry are (Infernal’s Wits + 1).

The Infernal can stack multiple uses of this Charm to create up to (Essence + 1) total tentacles. However, this doesn’t remove the restrictions on how many actions she can take on her turn.
## [[Keys]]
#### Devil-Kraken Embrace (Sail 5)
The Infernal adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice on Initiative rolls for the tentacles’ grapple gambits. She reduces their Initiative cost by two.
#### Flowing Terror Tide (Sail 5)
On the Infernal’s turn, she may reflexively retract a tentacle into the liquid it was created from and reemerge from another source of liquid within close range of its position. This doesn’t use her movement action, but she can only move one tentacle per turn, even if she manifests more.
#### Prehensile Horror Pseudopodia (Sail 5) (3m)
The tentacles can deal lethal damage, growing suckers, barbs, or acid-weeping eyes as needed. The Infernal can pay three motes to increase a tentacle’s range to medium for one attack.
#### Thousand-Limbed Terror Queen (Sail 5, Essence 3) (+3m per additional tentacle)
The Infernal can create multiple tentacles with a single use of this Charm, paying a three-mote surcharge for each tentacle past the first. If she has [[#Willful Horror Extrusion (Sail 5, Essence 3) (+1m, 1wp)|Willful Horror Extrusion]], she must pay its surcharge separately for each independent tentacle she creates.
#### Willful Horror Extrusion (Sail 5, Essence 3) (+1m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to create a tentacle that acts independently, rolling Join Battle for it with (Wits + {Occult or Sail}). It still uses the Infernal’s dice pools, but she no longer needs to use her actions to direct it (but can still use Charms to enhance its attacks). It uses its own Initiative to pay the cost of gambits. If the Infernal has [[#Flowing Terror Tide (Sail 5)|Flowing Terror Tide]], the tentacle can use movement actions to retract and re-emerge through liquid as per that key.
#### Acidic Anemone Lair ([[#Willful Horror Extrusion (Sail 5, Essence 3) (+1m, 1wp)|Willful Horror Extrusion]])
As long as the Infernal is within short range of an autonomous tentacle created with [[#Willful Horror Extrusion (Sail 5, Essence 3) (+1m, 1wp)|Willful Horror Extrusion]], it protects her from attacks as with a defend other action. If she has [[#Prehensile Horror Pseudopodia (Sail 5) (3m)|Prehensile Horror Pseudopodia]], she can pay three motes to extend this to medium range against a single attack.
