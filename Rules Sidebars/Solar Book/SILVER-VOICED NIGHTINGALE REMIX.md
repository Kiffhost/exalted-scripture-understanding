Silver-Voiced Nightingale style, as written, assumes that its stylists must sing to use its Charms. However, over the ages, offshoot branches and deviant schools of this style have developed that use other forms of musical performance. If you want to fight as a sanxian player who draws razor-sharp winds forth with each pluck of the strings, a flute-player whose scales burst eardrums and shatter bones, or a freestyle poet whose rhymes sear themselves into the skin of his enemies as characters writ in fireâ€”go for it!
