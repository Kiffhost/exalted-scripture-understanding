The Lunar is master of as many weapons as she has hands to wield them. While she has one full-cost attunement to an artifact weapon, she reduces the attunement cost of further artifact weapons by three motes each. This doesn’t stack with other discounts. If she ends her full-cost attunement, she must commit enough motes to bring another attunement to its full cost, or else all discounted attunements end.
