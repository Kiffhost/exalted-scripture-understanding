Soulfarer is a two-headed battle-axe traced with shallow grooves running around the weapon’s two hearthstone sockets to channel whatever blood it spills. Its haft is carved from the bones of the Locust Moon, a hekatonkhire of direful hunger, though it must be kept wrapped with silk funerary talismans. It is said to be the last relic of an empire of necromancer-kings who warred against the Exalted host in the First Age. After the rebellion of ghost-princes was put down, Soulfarer was claimed by the young sorcerer Yasha Vol, for whom this was the first taste of true battle. She soon discovered Soulfarer’s dark hunger for blood. Every battle, the grimcleaver demanded more of her, draining her vitality even as she became renowned as a legendary master of both axe and sorcery. In the early years, she put it to noble purposes — executing loathsome criminals, slaying great beasts, and striking down enemies of Creation. As time went on, she became indiscriminate in finding foes, welcoming wars of conquest or murders in the heat of passion. Soulfarer had triumphed over her resolve, making her its weapon. Yasha Vol was ultimately slain by her own Circle, horrified at the monster she had become. Deciding that Soulfarer was the corruption’s source, they journeyed into the Underworld, sealing it in that realm’s darkest depths. But five years ago, the grimcleaver returned to Creation, wielded by a deathknight’s hand. Daughter of Wisps Unremembered swears fealty to no Deathlord, but pledges her victories to the Unconquered Sun instead.
