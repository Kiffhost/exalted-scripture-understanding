A swooping circle of moonsilver inset with seven glinting jewels, Far-Ranging Eye was created not as a weapon, but as a vow. Ojun of Qamad was a prince of modest power and ambition who trusted too easily and inquired too little after his generals and counselors. Ripped from his throne and left on the savannah, Ojun found unknown courage, resolve, and ferocity. When he returned to Qamad, he was a hardened creature, made strong by exile and raised high by Luna’s grace. None speak of the bloody day of his vengeance, except to say that he tore seven jewels from his ancestral crown before putting it on the head of some cousin. He swore to keep better vigil over Creation than he’d managed over his homeland, and forged those jewels into Far-Ranging Eye, so he might always remember his inattention’s cost. In the hands of the outcaste Ahta Najit, Far-Ranging Eye was a weapon of justice, ever vigilant for bloody hands and guilty minds. For Starless Shadow, it was a bulwark against countless assassination attempts. Today, Far-Ranging Eye has passed back into legend, last seen in the treasure-house of Highroost — a falconfolk clan fallen into chaos and infighting.
