Having mastered those things that precede the end, the martial artist fights with the same cold detachment with which Saturn makes her sign. The stylist gains the following benefits: 
-  When she uses Secrets of Future Strife, her enemies’ wound penalties apply to their effective Initiative to determine when they act that round. 
-  When she uses Blade of the Battle Maiden, she also adds the same number of dice on the attack roll. 
-  When she uses Flight of Mercury, she may reflexively advance one range band toward her target if he’s crashed or has a wound penalty of −2 or worse. This doesn’t count as her move action. 
-  Joy-in-Adversity Stance’s cost is reduced by (her attacker’s wound penalty/2, rounded up). 

## Special activation rules

When the stylist deals enough decisive damage to increase a nontrivial enemy’s wound penalty, she may reflexively enter this Form.
