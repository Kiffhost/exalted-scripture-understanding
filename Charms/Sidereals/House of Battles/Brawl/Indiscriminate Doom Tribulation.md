Feeling along the threads of her enemies’ fates, the Sidereal strums a terrible resonance of betrayal. The Sidereal makes a decisive attack, adding extra successes as damage dice. After the damage roll, her victim may transfer the damage, onslaught penalty, and any other harmful effects of the attack to one of his nontrivial allies present in the scene. If he has a positive Tie to her, that character suffers ([[Intimacy]]) additional dice of damage. He must genuinely view her as an ally to enact this betrayal (though the feeling need not be mutual). 
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Sidereal’s [[Initiative]] and then reaching [[Initiative]] 15+.
