When Bleys Morning Sky lost his right hand in the Sunstrife Wars, the sorceress Firethorn — who had always loved Bleys, always unreciprocated — saw an opportunity. Bringing her forge to a mountain meadow, a place of sunlight and flowers, she crafted Arete to replace the missing hand, infusing it with all the grace she saw in Bleys’ movements and all the beauty she saw in his soul. This would be her gift to him. Even if they would never be together, at least a part of Firethorn would always be with Bleys. By the time Arete was complete, Bleys had visited Achim of the Thousand Herbs, the era’s greatest chirurgeon, whose uncanny skill had coaxed his body into growing a new hand of flesh and blood and bone. After some consideration, FirethorncutawayherownhandandfixedAreteinitsplace. The golden hand served Firethorn well through the Interregnum, when she stubbornly guarded her domain without aid from her peers. First Age scholars remarked on the perfection of her calligraphy in correspondence and treaties, while those who witnessed her in battle spoke of the uncanny grace with which the hand guided her sword and wove her spells. She trained many students, but never wed nor named an heir. Like the rest of her panoply, she took Arete to the grave. 
 
## Evocations of Arete

Attuned for three motes, Arete functions as a normal right hand, with full sensitivity and range of motion. While attuning an artifact weapon, the Exalt may link its attunement to Arete. This reduces the weapon’s attunement cost by one mote and lets her ready it reflexively with Arete. Only one weapon can be linked to Arete at a time. Arete’s legend is one of discovering self-sufficiency. Its bearer gains +1 Resolve against instill actions that would create or strengthen an Intimacy focused on someone or something other than herself, and against inspire actions to inflame her with loneliness or yearning. Due to its affinity for truth to one’s nature, Arete shapeshifts with a Lunar wearer.
