Stigmata brand the Abyssal as one of the damned, marking her with an eerie and unworldly figure. Some are subtle, omens recognized only by the wise. Others are unmistakable, revealing the Abyssal’s dark nature to all who see her. 
## Minor Stigmata
Minor Stigmata are subtle, either difficult to notice or possible to explain away. They last one scene unless otherwise specified. Examples include:
- The Abyssal’s skin becomes unnaturally cold.
- The deathknight casts no reflection, or her reflection appears as a rotting corpse.
- The smell of grave dirt and decay clings to the Abyssal.
- Raitons follow the deathknight in large numbers.
- The Abyssal’s shadow distends, its proportions growing warped and inhuman.
- The deathknight’s presence unnerves animals.
- The deathknight’s eyes glow red, are filled with solid black, or undergo similar changes.
## Major Stigmata
Major Stigmata are much harder to conceal or explain, marking the Abyssal as a thing of death. They last one session unless otherwise specified. Examples include:
- The Abyssal’s hands drip endlessly with blood, soaking through anything used to cover them.
- The Abyssal’s shadow takes on a life of its own, moving independently of her.
- Animals flee from the deathknight’s presence unless they’re familiars or have been trained for battle.
- The Abyssal suffer a Minor Stigmata for one session. 
## Defining Stigmata
Defining Stigmata are unambiguous and unconcealable manifestations of monstrosity. They last one session unless otherwise specified. Examples include:
- The Abyssal’s flesh rots and withers, giving her the appearance of a shambling corpse and inflicting a −3 penalty on Appearance rolls.
- Eerie phantoms swirl around the Abyssal, weeping or silently screaming.
- Mortals find the Abyssal’s presence unbearable, bleeding from the eyes when they look on her and treating any positive Ties toward her as one step weaker.
- The Abyssal suffer a Major Stigmata for one story.
