*Spider in Society’s Web Few know the price of a soul like those who’ve sold their own.*
The Abyssal makes a special read intentions roll to discern what it would take to convince someone to perform a specific task. She adds ([[Essence]]) automatic successes on the roll and rerolls 5s and 6s until they cease to appear. If she’s able to provide this to him, no further roll is needed to persuade him to perform the task.
## Special activation rules
If the Abyssal uses [[Merciless Dissecting Stare]] on the roll, success gives her an additional ([[Essence]]) guesses at the target’s Intimacies related to his price.
