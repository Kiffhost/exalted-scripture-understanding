This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
The character controls a place of power in Creation. A demesne is a wellspring of incredible geomantic power, usually a site of incredible natural splendor. A demesne might be the heart of a primeval forest, a crystal cavern behind a mighty waterfall, a field of black glass where desert abuts an ancient volcano, or any other place of clear majesty and power. Most demesnes are strongly aspected toward one of the five elements, but certain rare demesnes resonate with the Essence of the sun or moon, of destiny, or even of death.
A character attuned to a demesne who stands within its boundaries enjoys certain benefits. Outside of combat, he respires an additional two motes of Essence per hour, and may reflexively roll (Perception + Occult, difficulty 3) to sense any active expenditure of Essence within the demesneâ€™s boundaries. The demesne can also be used as a Means for sorcerous workings which resonate with its nature (pgs. 487-488), granting one extra interval.
As a four-dot Merit, the character gains control of an exceptionally powerful demesne. She respires four extra motes per hour outside of combat, the difficulty to detect Essence-use becomes 1, and using the demesne as a Means grants two extra intervals.
