One of the latter works of Frey Irenio, the Painted Door is an odd artifact, seemingly designed to aid in the theatrical endeavors of the Solar sorcerer-smith’s Circlemate, Nia Firedancer. It appears to be a simple folding prop door, painted in white, gold, and green in a triangular tile pattern. Its true nature is only revealed with the performance of the now-obscure First Age tragedy Departure of the Visitant. Authentic copies of the script are proscribed by the Immaculate Order, but a rare few are possessed by antiquarians, scavenger princes, sorcerers, and demon cultists.

The play requires five actors and a modest amount of props and scenery. It takes approximately two hours to stage and must be performed entirely in Old Realm. At its culmination, the actor playing the eponymous Visitant, having thrown the imperial court of Duwa into disarray, makes her dramatic exeunt through the Painted Door. She must pay ten motes and make a difficulty 3 ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Performance) roll to use the Door. If she succeeds and the play was performed adequately, she enters a place that seems similar to the one she left, a facsimile of the building in which the play was performed, but ancient and abandoned by all but she. It doesn’t take much exploration to find that the crumbling ruin is lost in Endless Desert, five days from the Demon City. There is no way to return through the Painted Door.

Nia Firedancer used the door only once. When she finally returned to Creation, she is said to have returned the gift to Frey Irenio.
