*The world is a wicked, broken thing, and to exist in it is to suffer. To think otherwise is a torment worse than any damnation.*

The Infernal makes a ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence) to inspire hope. If she succeeds, affected characters’ irrational hope imposes a −3 penalty on rolls to notice threats or appreciate the danger they pose. This includes Join Battle rolls against concealed enemies or enemies whose true strength is unknown to them. The Storyteller may require (Perception + Awareness) rolls from affected characters to notice danger that would normally be obvious without a roll.
When the scene ends and the inspired hope subsides, it lingers as a Minor Principle expressing a hopeful, optimistic outlook on life. Each affected character’s player chooses this Intimacy’s precise phrasing. As long as a character has that Intimacy, he suffers a −1 penalty on rolls to notice danger. If he’s acting in accordance with the Principle, the penalty increases to −3 and the Storyteller may call for rolls to detect obvious threats. A victim can’t voluntarily erode this Intimacy unless he’s faced with a dramatic challenge to his optimism: suffering a significant defeat or failure, finding the aftermath of a village being slaughtered, learning of a loved one’s dire illness, etc.
If the Infernal has an Intimacy based on hope, she may add (Intimacy) non-Charm successes on her influence roll. If she does, she’s automatically inspired with hope and suffers this Charm’s effects for the rest of the scene. (She doesn’t gain an Intimacy once the scene ends.) She can’t spend Willpower to resist this.
## [[Keys]]
#### Clinging to Folly (Presence 5, Essence 3)
Affected characters suffer this Charm’s full effect for as long as they keep its Intimacy. They must pay one Willpower to voluntarily weaken the Intimacy.
