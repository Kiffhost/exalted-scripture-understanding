They say a sailor’s mistress is the sea. Well, the Solar captain’s only true mistress is death. But not even death would try the crazy shit a Lawgiver captain is liable to pull. When the Solar uses this Charm, her player may introduce a hazard that imperils her ship and one other, that may only be avoided through incredible sailing. Roll the Solar’s Wits + Sail against that of her adversary. If the Solar has the greater result, her maneuvering not only allows her ship to skate through unscathed, but also causes the other ship to wreck spectacularly. This might involve the Solar sailing to the edge of a waterfall and pulling an impossible u-turn as her adversary sails right over the edge, or it might describe a Solar pushing her skyship into a steep descent, so the sun blinds her pursuer and causes them to wreck on a high cliff. However, if the Solar loses the clash of sail, her opponent not only escapes the trap, but it also backfires, doing two damage to the hull of the Solar’s ship. This Charm can be used once per story, but may be reset by using Sail to overcome a distinct disadvantage that threatens your crew or your ship. This Charm can in fact reset itself. Repeatedly, if needs be. On Death-Daring Manuever This Charm is chiefly apocryphal because it is really powerful. The backer wanted a Charm to help him create dangerous hazards he could sail around while other players wreck their shit. If you like it, use it anyway. Without a Willpower cost, you can technically use it repeatedly, provided your ship is damaged or you are suffering wound penalties, or have some other distinct disadvantage. Use it to force a bunch of ships to follow you down a whirlpool and laugh maniacally as you are the only one that sails back out again. Backer: Clear Frozen Skies
