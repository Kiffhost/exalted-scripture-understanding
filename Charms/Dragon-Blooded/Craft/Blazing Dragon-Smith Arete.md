The Dragon-Blood’s genius is explosive, as powerful and dangerous as an erupting volcano. She undertakes a superior or legendary project, enhancing all of her rolls with (Essence) non-Charm bonus dice and rolling a non-Charm die for each 10, but at the cost of lowering the project’s terminus by one. If she completes the project successfully, she gains one white point in addition to the normal crafting reward.
