The Infernal’s body adapts as it is attacked, strengthening her mutagenic flesh as it is damaged or adjusting crackling fields of Essence to intercept known techniques. After taking damage from an attack, she increases her durability against further attacks from the same enemy during the scene. Against subsequent withering attacks, she increases her soak by (Essence + 5) and reduces their Overwhelming by one, to a minimum of one. Against decisive attacks, she gains a Hardness of (Essence + 12) and reduces the damage roll by one success. The Infernal’s Adaptive Defense is reset if she’s crashed. She can’t adapt to new attacks while crashed.
