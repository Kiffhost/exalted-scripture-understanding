The Lunar weaves blood-chilling threats into idle banter or small talk without changing her tone of voice or demeanor, leaving victims confused and terrified. When she makes a threaten roll with any Attribute, her targets won’t form negative Ties toward her because of it, nor can they strengthen negative Ties to her at the scene’s end. Such characters won’t take offense at the threats or respond with hostility. Resisting the threaten roll ends this effect; affected characters unable to do so may spend one Willpower to resist solely the effect of this Charm instead. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
