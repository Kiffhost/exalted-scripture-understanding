Meditating on the frozen moment, the Lawgiver sees the universe aligning around the neck of her target. Through strength, balance and control, she pulls at the distance between herself and her foe, and flashes in for the kill. The Exalt may use this Charm as far away as medium range, to instantly flash past her opponent, striking him at close range. If her attack is withering, it deals double damage after soak, but before damage is rolled. If it is decisive, it adds her Essence score to the base damage of the attack. As the Solar slides past her opponent, she ends the attack standing at close range. This counts as the characterâ€™s movement for the round. In order to use this Charm, the Solar must be at higher Initiative than her opponent, and at 6+ Initiative. Leaping Tiger Attack is explicitly allowed to be used in combination with the Charms of other Abilities, but is incompatible with Thunderbolt Attack Prana and Eagle-Wing Style.
