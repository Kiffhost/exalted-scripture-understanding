*The Solar makes an Essence-infused throw that strikes her opponent to the ground.*
This Charm is a difficulty 4 Thrown gambit that, if successful, will knock down an opponent.
Alternately, if the Solar hurls a bola, net, or other snare, then she makes a difficulty 4 [[Thrown]]-based grapple gambit against her target. If successful, roll ([[Strength]] + [[Thrown]]) to establish clinch control, with a number of automatic successes equal to extra successes on the initial attack roll plus one. The control roll cannot be modified by [[Thrown]] or other Ability [[Charms]]. If successful the target is snared for the number of control rounds plus one. If the number of control rounds exceeds their [[Strength]], they also fall to the ground. 
A snared character can attempt to struggle free by spending a complete action without a flurry to remove two rounds of control each turn. They can also instantly break free from snares made of non-magical materials (cords, cables, etc) with a [[Strength]] 5+ difficulty 5 feat of strength. 
Lastly, if the Lawgiver has the other end of a line, rope, or other tether hooked to the snare, then if she knows the [[Brawl]] Charm [[Crashing Wave Throw]] (Exalted p. 275) then she can use it to sling her opponent violently into scenery with a decisive throw. The Solar is considered to have ([[Essence]] + 1) more [[Strength]] than her actual rating for the purpose of this stunt. Damage on this attack resets the Solar to base [[Initiative]]. 
Lastly, unassisted characters must struggle at least one round to remove this snare, even if the control rounds have been completely expended. A net won’t just fall off on its own, and a character bound by the legs and hurled with [[Crashing Wave Throw]] isn’t set free by smashing into scenery, even though this forfeits all rounds of control. This gambit can be supplemented by [[Diving Hawk Discipline]].

### On [[Whirlwind Hand of the Striker]]

I know it is a complex Charm. Just make sure to record extra successes on the attack roll to apply to the control roll. The [[Crashing Wave Throw]] tie-in can be ignored if you don’t have [[Brawl]], but if you want to play a character who hooks people by the legs with a weighted line and then hurls them to a dangle over the rooftops, this is the Charm for you. 
As an aside, if you want to free a snared character, there are a couple of ways you might do it. A Storyteller should require a character to use their action without a flurry and an appropriate stunt to try to help a friend get free, removing an additional -2 rounds of control. Alternately you might have them try a difficulty 3 gambit to cut the snare loose with an edged, lethal weapon. A botch on the [[Initiative]] roll should be rather spectacular.
