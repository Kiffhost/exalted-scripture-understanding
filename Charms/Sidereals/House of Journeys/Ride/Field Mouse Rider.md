The Sidereal demands the impossible of her familiars and is not disappointed, bending their fates in service to hers. The Sidereal can ride one of her familiars no matter how unsuited it is to that task — even a flea can bear her weight. Her familiar doesn’t suffer any ill effects from this. If it has no Speed Bonus listed or a negative Speed Bonus, its Speed Bonus becomes +0; otherwise, its Speed Bonus increases by +1. If the Sidereal renews this Charm when its duration ends, she waives its Willpower cost. With an Essence 2 repurchase, the Sidereal can use this Charm to ride animals other than her familiar. If she knows Breaking the Wild Mortal, she can use it on any willing character.
