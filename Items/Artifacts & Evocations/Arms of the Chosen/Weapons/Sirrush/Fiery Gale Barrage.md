*With a wild barrage of fire, the Exalt shatters every obstruction between her and the perfect shot.*
This Evocation supplements an attack against a target behind cover, treating the attack roll as a feat of strength to destroy whatever provides the cover, as long as it doesnâ€™t require a [[Strength]] higher than 5 to attempt. [[Cover]] thus destroyed provides no protection against the attack.
