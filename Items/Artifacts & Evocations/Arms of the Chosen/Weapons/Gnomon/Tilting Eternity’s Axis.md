As a foe brings his blade down, seizes a precious jewel, or opens his mouth to speak, time stops. This Evocation allows the wielder to reflexively clash any action with a custom gambit whose difficulty is determined by the Storyteller, adding a free full Excellency on the attack roll. She might lock a pair of manacles onto a brawler’s wrists, throw a handful of muck at a demagogue about to give a speech, or sweep aside the leaves concealing the pit trap she’s dug in an eyeblink beneath her enemy’s feet. This doesn’t count as her combat action for the turn. Outside of combat, the Storyteller may allow the wielder to inflict the effects of the gambit without an Initiative roll. This Evocation can only be used once per day, unless reset by being awarded a two- or three-point stunt on an action taken in the frozen time of Step Between Seconds or similar Evocations of Gnomon. 

## Resonant

On a successful gambit, the wielder gains a point of temporary Willpower.
