The Sidereal cuts short the lifespan of a disease festering within her, healed by the same flame to which she’s fed her life. When the Sidereal uses Burn Life, she may reflexively roll a feat of demolition against the morbidity of a disease she suffers. Success heals mundane diseases completely or weakens supernatural diseases’ intensity by one step. It also waives Burn Life’s health level cost and toll on the Sidereal’s lifespan. On a failed roll, the Sidereal can’t use this Charm against the disease again.
