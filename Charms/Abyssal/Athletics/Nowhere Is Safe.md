*The Abyssal moves with the speed denied to those born of flesh â€” she is as a shadow, a nightmare, a creeping dread.*
The Abyssal doubles 9s on rushes and opposed [[Athletics]] rolls in speed-based competitions. When she rushes an enemy, he loses one [[Initiative]] for each 10 she rolls. Outside of combat, she moves with incredible speed, capable of maintaining a speed of ([[Dexterity]] x10) miles per hour over open terrain.
If the Abyssal reactivates this Charm at the end of its duration, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost.
If the Abyssal has [[Superior Weapon-Body]] (p. XX), it adds ([[Essence]]) dice on rolls enhanced by this Charm instead of doubling 9s.
