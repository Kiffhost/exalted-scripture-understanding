Deft fingers trace the contours of mystical seals and otherworldly portals, feeling for the crack through which the Sidereal can pass. The Sidereal rolls (Wits + Larceny) to enter a spirit’s sanctum, use an otherwise inaccessible portal, cross between realms of existence, or temporarily breach a magical barrier. The roll’s difficulty equals the Essence of the character who created or owns the boundary; if no such character exists, the Storyteller assigns a difficulty from 1-5. Success lets the Sidereal and (Essence x2) companions pass through safely.
