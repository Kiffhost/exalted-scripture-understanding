Some doors are not locked by conventional means; some are sealed by complex sorcery or mechanisms hidden out of sight; still others are bounded by dozens or even hundreds of locks, making it implausible to pick them all. Yet no door may bar the Lawgiver’s entrance. The Exalt reaches for the door as if to touch it, and then steps forward. When her foot falls, she is on the other side of the portal. The Solar can use this talent to pass through a locked window, a sewer grate, a dropped portcullis or even an archway that drips lightning. This Charm is based on the Solar’s illimitable skill for infiltration; she cannot pass through solid walls or reach into a sealed chest and fish around.
