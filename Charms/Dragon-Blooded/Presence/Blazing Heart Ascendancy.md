*Fire is best fought with fire.*
This Charm supplements a persuade or threaten roll made with [[Presence]] or [[Socialize]]. If the target enters a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] to resist the supplemented influence, the only [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] he can call upon to justify his resistance are those based on passion. [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] with no emotional power, such as a [[Intimacy|Principle]] of belief in the rule of law, cannot be used, even if they have a higher intensity. Characters who have no passionate [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] to inflame are immune to this effect.
