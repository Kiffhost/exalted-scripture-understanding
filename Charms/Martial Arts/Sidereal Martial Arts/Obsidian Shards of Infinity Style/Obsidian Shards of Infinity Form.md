*Look upon the infinite, and grasp enlightenment like a knife.*
The stylist gains the following benefits: 
- Once per round, she can clash an attack against her with a decisive attack. If she was in concealment, she can reflexively roll Stealth to reestablish it. She can’t clash unexpected attacks. 
- Her appearance is indistinct and amorphous, more reflection than flesh, inflicting a –3 penalty on attacks against her. This counts as a darkness-based penalty. 
- She can attack enemies within medium range by striking a surface they’re reflected in. If there’s a reflective surface within close range of the enemy, she can instead attack him through any reflective surface. These becomes surprise attacks, inflicting −2 Defense. 
- Her eyes become black and glassy, granting a bonus dot of Perception, which can raise it above 5. Unlike with most bonus dots, this is counted by any Obsidian Shards Charms that use her Perception. She ignores penalties from darkness or excessive light and can’t be blinded by magic. 
## Special Activation Rules
When the stylist establishes concealment against all enemies, she may reflexively enter this Form.
