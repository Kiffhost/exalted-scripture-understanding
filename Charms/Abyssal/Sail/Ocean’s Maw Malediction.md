*The Abyssal’s haunting song beckons horrors from the deep to harrow the living and dead alike.*
The Abyssal draws forth one of the oceanic perils below. If she uses it outside of combat, she rolls ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]) against a vessel she perceives, opposed by its captain’s ([[Wits]] + [[Sail]]) roll. If she doesn’t target a ship, the [[Storyteller]] can set a difficulty or let another character make an opposed roll, as appropriate. In naval combat, she can use this Charm as a special stratagem by paying an additional Momentum cost.
As a special naval combat stratagem, the Abyssal captain attempts to trap her opponents’ vessel in one of the following hazards:
Wailing Reef (3 Momentum): Jagged coral spires emerge, wreathed in moaning corpses. This can block harbors, prevent escapes, and so on. In naval combat, it deals two [[Hull]] damage and inflicts a −3 penalty on the opposing vessel’s next Naval Maneuver roll.
Foul Tide (4 Momentum): The sea curdles into thick black blood. Ships caught in it suffer −1 Mobility and all liquids aboard the ship are befouled, turning to blood. In naval combat, success also forces the opposing ship to succeed on a special positioning stratagem to escape the morass before they may attempt any stratagems that require movement. This doesn’t generate any Momentum.
Mists of Despair (2 Momentum): Phantasmagoric mist enshrouds the ship or area, causing those who breathe it to suffer haunting hallucinations. Those exposed to it must roll ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) or ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) at difficulty 5 or suffer the effects of Major Madness (Exalted, p. 168) for as long as they remain in the mist. They must immediately make a [[Willpower]] roll against it, and do so again at the start of each subsequent scene. This costs one [[Willpower]] to resist for a scene. In naval combat, success afflicts the opposing captain with Madness, as above, without receiving another roll to resist. He suffers a −3 penalty on Naval Maneuver rolls for the rest of the scene.
Hazards created with this Charm crumble or dissipate within a day, though they may leave traces for up to a season, such as blood clots washing ashore from a Foul Tide. In the Underworld, hazards may remain permanently at the Storyteller’s discretion.
