*A king among all lesser creatures, the Infernal’s steed carries her authority wherever it goes.*

The Infernal imparts her authority on a mount, granting it the following benefits:
- Animals count as having a Major Tie of fearful awe toward it. First Circle demons count as having the same Tie at Minor intensity.
- It can reflexively manifest a crown of emerald flame, like the one granted by [[Beast of Proud Bearing]], which provides that Charm’s bonus on threaten rolls. If the mount already benefits from that Charm, the threaten bonus increases by one and it gains one Initiative when it succeeds on a threaten roll.
- Any environmental penalties or penalties from difficult terrain that it suffers are reduced by two. This also applies to such penalties on its rider’s Ride rolls.
- It doubles 9s on rolls to resist environmental hazards.
- It can run or otherwise exert itself for up to (Infernal’s Essence + 5) hours each day without that effort causing it to tire at all or to accrue fatigue penalties.

The Infernal can use this Charm on up to (higher of Essence or 3) mounts at a time.
