This elegant black jade and starmetal circlet has a single hearthstone setting over the Exalt’s caste mark. Its name is no poetic flourish; its manufacture requires a dragon’s tears — tears of sorrow, of anger, and of joy. 

Attuned for three motes, the tiara wonderfully refines its wearer’s sensitivity to the flow of Essence. She double 9s on non-sorcerous Occult rolls — astrology, geomancy, detecting spirits, and so on; this improves to double 8s if she has another Charm or ability that gives her double 9s. Any Occult or Perception Charms that enhance her ability to perceive the unnatural gain the [[Charm Keywords#Mute|Mute]] keyword. Any such Charms with a duration of one scene or longer are extended to Indefinite as long as she wears the tiara, unless they have Willpower or anima costs.
