Summer Thunder remembers the riders who ranged at Kestra’s side, awaiting a spark to set those memories ablaze with life. The wielder fires an arrow at a point within medium range. The phantom of an ancient nomadic warrior appears at that point, shining with the colors of the Exalt’s anima, with the traits of a nomadic horse-archer (Exalted, p. 497). He never tires and need not sleep, eat, drink, nor breathe. The warrior and his mount both have Defining Ties of loyalty to the wielder and cannot be intimidated. These phantoms are manifestations of anima and martial virtue; they are echoes, not ghosts, drawn solely from the bow’s memory of battles past. It’s said that Kestra evoked the shades of sisters and lovers in this way, until their false nature so saddened her that she banished all such phantoms. The phantoms of horse-archers who die in the wielder’s service may be drawn from the bow by this Evocation, and she may likewise call echoes of fallen mounts when activating Phantom Steed. This Evocation can be used once per scene, unless reset when the wielder suffers enough damage from a decisive attack to increase her wound penalty, or when a non-trivial ally is incapacitated, surrenders, or flees from battle.
