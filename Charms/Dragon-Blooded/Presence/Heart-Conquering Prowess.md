*Such is the elegance and beauty of the Dragon-Blood’s martial prowess that even her staunchest enemies must respect it.*
She adds (Appearance/2, rounded up) bonus dice on an attack roll. If the enhanced attack is decisive and deals damage greater than its target’s [[Resolve]] or incapacitates him, the Dragon-Blood can forgo inflicting one level of damage to erode a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] her victim has toward her by one step. If he has no negative Ties to her, she can forgo a level of damage to instill him with a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] for her, with an emotional context chosen by his player. Treat this as an instill action that succeeds automatically without a roll, although it must still leverage a supporting [[Intimacy]] to strengthen an [[Intimacy]] to or weaken it from Major or Defining intensity (Exalted, p. 215). If an attack enhanced by this Charm incapacitates an enemy, he can’t spend [[Willpower]] to resist, but is left merely unconscious, not dying.
