*Following the utterance of impossible syllables, the earth ruptures around the necromancer into a whirlwind of shattered bones and ribbons of rotten flesh.*
The necromancer creates a gruesome whirlwind, providing light cover to her and to any allies within close range. Enemies who attack the necromancer from close range are assailed by whirling fragments of flesh and bone, a onetime environmental hazard with difficulty 3, Damage 2L.
The storm gathers dead flesh and bone in the necromancer’s path, tearing apart any corpses within close range of her to pieces and adding to its mass. Once the effective Size of the consumed corpses reach 1 (Exalted, p. 206), the cover increases to heavy. This also inflicts a −3 penalty on vision-based Awareness rolls against anything within close range of her. The consumed corpse’s Size is also added to the hazard’s difficulty and damage, maximum difficulty 5, Damage 7L.
This spell ends if the necromancer is crashed or incapacitated.
## Control
Gore carries an unusual appeal to the necromancer, drawing her to inspect viscera whenever she chances upon it. As a miscellaneous action, the necromancer may mutilate and compress corpses within short range with a wave of her hand, compacting them into crude structures of rotting flesh in a burst of gore.
These corpse-barriers provide light cover. They can be destroyed with a Strength 3+ feat of demolition at difficulty 3.
## Distortion (10)
Distortion strips away the flesh from any corpses the storm’s absorbed, removing their benefits and preventing the storm from absorbing any further corpses.
