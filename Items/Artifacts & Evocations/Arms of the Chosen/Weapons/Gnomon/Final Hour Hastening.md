Gnomon unwinds the moment of an attack into a seeming eternity as its wielder delivers a barrage of innumerable strikes. Against an enemy with lower Initiative, this attack is unblockable. Enemies with equal or higher Initiative suffer −2 Parry instead. If the attack hits, the barrage magically inflicts an additional point of onslaught penalty on the target. This Evocation’s cost is waived if used during the frozen time of Step Between Seconds. 

## Dissonant

This Evocation can only be used against enemies whose Initiative is less than or equal to the wielder’s, not greater. 

## Resonant

The wielder adds (Essence) to her effective Initiative to determine whether her attack is unblockable.
