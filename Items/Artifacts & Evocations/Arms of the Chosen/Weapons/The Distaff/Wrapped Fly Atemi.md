To use this Evocation, the wielder must be in control of a grapple. It uses up two rounds of grapple control to entangle her opponent with silk — tying his limbs together, blindfolding or gagging him, or so on. This imposes the effects of a Flaw (Exalted, p. 167) that fits the nature of the restraint, such as Amputee, Blind, or Mute. This isn’t a crippling effect. The bindings can be broken with a difficulty 4 feat of strength. The Strength 3+ requirement to attempt a feat is waived if a character uses a cutting edge. With an appropriate stunt, a character may roll a different dice pool, such as (Dexterity + Melee), against difficulty 4 to free the bound character. This Evocation cannot be used on the same enemy more than once per grapple.
