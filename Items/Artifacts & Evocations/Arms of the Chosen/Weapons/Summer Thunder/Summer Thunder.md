After the [[War]] of the Gods, the Solar outrider Kestra Lightning-Hoof returned home to lead her people. The children of the steppe, however, would not have her, for they were the tribe of swift-hooved Hiparkes, and was she not of the Sun’s tribe now? Undeterred, she and her Sun-blessed steed hunted great Hiparkes, forcing the horse-god to kneel and breaking him to her will. She sheared his mane and twisted it into a string for her orichalcum bow, and she rode him home in triumph to demand her people’s fealty. The short powerbow [[Summer Thunder]] was borne by Kestra and her heirs all across the East, from northeastern tundra to savannahs betwixt Summer Mountains and Dreaming Sea. Its wielders fought the Shadow-Riders of Wan, hunted behemoths and numinous terrors at world’s edge, and forged armies to rule prairie and steppe. The bow was buried with its last Solar master in what became Medo, and one of that land’s cyclopean walls was built over the tomb. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Summer Thunder]]

If the Exalt twists a strand from a willing steed’s mane or tail into Summer Thunder’s bowstring and spends one [[Willpower]], that steed becomes bonded and gains +1 [[Resolve]] for as long as the bow remains attuned. Mounts summoned with [[Phantom Steed]] are automatically bonded. Summer Thunder’s [[Evocations]] only function while riding a bonded mount.
