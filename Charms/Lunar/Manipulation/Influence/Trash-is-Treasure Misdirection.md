Uncertain Sky Ambiguity The Lunar’s sales pitch conveys such impassioned sincerity that her mark sees pearls instead of pebbles. She makes a ([[Manipulation]] + [Performance or Presence]) bargain roll against a single character. If successful, she convinces him that whatever she offers is actually another object of a similar size and shape, but with a [[Resources]] value up to (1 + Lunar’s extra successes) higher than the actual object’s, before the Storyteller determines whether that offer is sufficient. She might pass off a handful of leaves as Realm scrip, a rusted saber as a bladesmith’s masterpiece, or a clay brick as a silver ingot. This isn’t an illusion or disguise — the Lunar’s lie is so convincing that her target disregards all evidence to the contrary, even that of his own eyes. This Psyche effect lasts (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) hours. An affected character may pay three [[Willpower]] to resist if another character disputes the object’s value, such as a vendor refusing to be paid in leaves, or if attempting to usetheobjectmakesapparentthediscrepancybetween what it is and what the victim believes it to be. Once the Lunar uses this Charm against a specific character, he’s immune to further uses for (his [[Integrity]]) days. With a [[Manipulation]] 5, [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Lunar may target multiple characters with this influence, spending at least several minutes speaking to do so. She uses the lowest number of extra successes over any audience member’s [[Resolve]] when determining what she can cause affected characters to perceive.
