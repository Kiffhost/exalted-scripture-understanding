*Wreathing herself in anima, the Lunar steps outside certainty to enter the lands of mystery.*
She rolls ([[Appearance]] + {[[Larceny]], [[Presence]], or [[Socialize]]}) as a special disguise, shrouding herself in a shifting congeries of light. Characters whose ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) rolls are beaten by her roll can’t discern any details about her identity or what manner of creature she is, unsure whether she’s a god, demon, or something stranger.
[[Read intentions]] and [[profile character]] rolls can still reveal information unrelated to her identity. Those who beat the Lunar’s roll can only tell she’s one of the [[Lunar Exalted]] — any details of her identity beyond that remain concealed.
