*The earth shall not suffer the heretic’s tread.*
When the wielder is attacked from close range by an enemy standing on earth or stone, she may use this Evocation. A successful parry causes her attacker to be sucked into the ground up to the waist, suffering the effects of being prone (Exalted, p. 202). He must succeed at a difficulty 2 ({Strength or Dexterity} + [[Athletics]]) roll to free himself, which counts as his move action. 
The wielder may end [[Dragons Provide]], detonating the boulder-head of [[Faith’s Pillar]], upon successfully parrying with [[Foundations of Sand]] to instead shatter the surface (earthen or otherwise) on which the attacker stands, creating a hole one range band deep. The attacker falls if he doesn’t catch its edge with a reflexive ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) roll with a difficulty of (1 + the number of successes he missed by). If the attacker has defied Faith’s Pillar’s dedicated [[Intimacy|Principle]] and stands on ground consecrated by [[Faith Maintains]], the difficulty to extricate himself or arrest his fall increases by ([[Intimacy|Principle]] − 1).
