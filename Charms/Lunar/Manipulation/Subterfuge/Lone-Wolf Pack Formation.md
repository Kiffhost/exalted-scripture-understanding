*Though the Lunar may lead only a handful of warriors, cunning tactics and misdirection multiply their ranks a hundredfold in her enemies’ eyes.*
An allied battle group gains +1 effective [[Size]], maximum 5, and adds (Lunar’s [[Essence]]) [[Magnitude Track|Magnitude]] to its [[Magnitude Track]]. This is a result of trickery and deception on the Lunar’s part, not additional numbers; if the [[battle group]] is reduced to [[Size]] 1, it dissipates entirely.
If the Lunar is fighting under an [[Ambush]] stratagem she’s enacted or if the targeted [[battle group]] has [[Size]] 2, she waives this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost.

## Protean 
In animal shapes, the Lunar also waives this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost when using it on a [[battle group]] made up of the same kind of animal.

## Archetype 
A Lunar whose spirit shape has Camouflage may learn this as an [[Appearance]] Charm, with [[One of the Herd]] and [[Victorious Beast-King Spirit]] as its prerequisites.
