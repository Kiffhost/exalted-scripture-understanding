The Sidereal plays the chord that completes a spirit’s life, allaying his every fear and answering his every question to bend him to the Sidereal’s ends. The Sidereal makes a special (Manipulation + Performance) instill roll against a spirit. Success instills a positive Major Tie to the Sidereal with an emotional context chosen by the spirit’s player. Against fire and wood elementals and other spirits associated with those elements, this Tie is Defining instead. The spirit can’t willing erode the Tie for the remainder of the story unless the Sidereal directly harms him or threatens one of his Major or Defining Intimacies, and even then, only by one level of intensity per offense.
