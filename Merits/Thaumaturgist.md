The character is able to wield a certain small magic, possibly as part of an ancient tradition, possibly as a unique prodigy of the world. No one can quite say why one individual is gifted with thaumaturgy while tens of thousands aren’t; perhaps the character is the seventh son of a seventh son, was blessed in the womb by a powerful god, or was simply born under a confluence of auspicious (or inauspicious…) signs. For more information on thaumaturgy, see pgs 490491. Exalted characters who take the Charm [[Charms/Solar/Occult/Terrestrial Circle Sorcery]] gain this Merit at no cost.
