Clothing herself in soul-deep lies, the Lunar outwits the eyes of prophets. While using Essential Mirror Nature, divination, magical scrying, and similar effects can’t provide information that contradicts her disguise, giving false results where necessary. A Sidereal who divines her future can’t predict events that betray her true identity; a city father’s Charms identify her as a resident of his city if she’s disguised as such; an enchanted gateway that rejects all but its maker will open to her if she’s disguised as him. Such effects still provide accurate information to the extent they can do so without contradicting the Lunar’s disguise. Magic that enhances mundane efforts to contest disguises is unimpeded by this Charm. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as a Manipulation Charm.
