The Sidereal dreams another life, escaping the stony tomb of her body to slumber in another’s grave. As the Sidereal sleeps, she projects her lucidly dreaming mind into an animal or spirit within long range, her slumbering body turning to stone as she leaves it. Alternatively, her player may leave the choice of host up to the Storyteller, extending the range to one mile. Against nontrivial targets, this requires a special (Charisma + Survival) influence roll. If successful, she enters her target’s mind: 
-  She experiences the world through his senses. She can make Perception rolls, using her own dice pools and Charms and benefitting from her host’s sense-enhancing Merits (but not a spirit’s Charms). Depending on her rolls, she may notice details that he overlooks, or vice versa. 
-  She can make influence rolls against her host, letting her dreams seep into its mind as fleeting whims or sudden impulses. Against trivial targets, she succeeds without needing to roll and doesn’t need to leverage Intimacies for persuade rolls. 
-  If she wears a resplendent destiny, her host seems appropriate for the role: under a soldier’s destiny, a wolf might seem a well-trained war hound; under a sailor’s guise, a gladenymph appears to be an ocean spirit. Other characters’ familiars are immune to this Charm. If the Sidereal uses it on her own familiar, she extends its duration to Indefinite and ignores its range limit. The Sidereal’s petrified body gains +5 soak and Hardness 20. This Charm ends if she takes decisive damage. If her host dies, this Charm ends and the Sidereal suffers (10 – Essence) dice of unavoidable aggravated damage. Exorcism can also expel her, dealing the same damage.
