*The Abyssal suspends all signs of life, becoming as a corpse.*
The Abyssal rolls ([[Stamina]] + {Larceny, [[Resistance]], or Stealth}) to feign death, doubling 9s. Her wound penalties add non-Charm dice instead of subtracting. Only characters with superhuman or magically enhanced senses can see through this, opposing it with a ([[Perception]] + {Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Medicine}) roll. Their 1s and 2s subtract successes. Moving, speaking, and other overt actions spoil this deception.
