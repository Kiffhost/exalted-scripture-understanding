Making a throwing gesture with an empty hand, the Sidereal catches and draws in the thread of an object’s fate. The Sidereal can pay a three-mote surcharge to use Shrike-Roosting Gesture on an object she hasn’t handled that scene as long as it’s not in active use, treating it as a pickpocketing roll. Disarmed weapons are valid targets, though artifacts remain attuned to their wielders. With an Essence 3 repurchase, stealing an artifact weapon breaks its attunement, but the original wielder’s motes remain committed for the scene, freeing the Sidereal from needing to commit her own.
