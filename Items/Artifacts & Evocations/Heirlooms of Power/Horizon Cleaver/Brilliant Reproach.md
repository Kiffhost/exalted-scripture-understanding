Horizon Cleaver’s wielder can unleash its lightning — at great collateral risk. She makes a decisive attack. If it deals damage, its victim loses ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]], which the wielder doesn’t gain, and becomes thunderstruck for the scene, suffering a −2 penalty on physical actions. If the wielder’s 1s and 2s on her attack roll exceed (lower of her [[Integrity]] or [[Resistance]]), she loses control of [[Horizon Cleaver]], and the attack is redirected to a random target within range — including the wielder or her allies. 

## Special activation rules

A Dragon-Blooded Tepet scion who attunes to [[Horizon Cleaver]] awakens this Evocation at no cost. 

## Resonant

If a character resonant with jade has a [[Intimacy|Principle]] that reflects her code of honor, she adds its rating to the total number of 1s and 2s she can roll without losing control of the lightning.
