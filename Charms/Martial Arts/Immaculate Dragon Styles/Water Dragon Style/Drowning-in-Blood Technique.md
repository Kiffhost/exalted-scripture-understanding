Striking her foe’s chest with a rapid barrage, the Immaculate redirects the flow of his blood so that it pours into his lungs. Her decisive attack doubles 10s on its damage roll. If she deals 3+ levels of damage, her foe begins choking on his own blood, raising his wound penalty by one until the scene ends or he crashes the Immaculate. Essence is the life’s blood of spirits, and this attack turns its flow against them. Multiple uses stack the wound penalty increase against spirits, maximum (Essence). In Water Aura, the Immaculate adds (her foe’s wound penalty/2, rounded up) bonus dice of damage.
