*The Lunar’s quills twist within the wounds they inflict, growing spines or secreting corrosive acid.*
She may pay a three-mote surcharge on [[Stinging Ichneumon Scourge]] to inflict ongoing harm. On withering attacks, the victim loses [[Initiative]] (which the Lunar doesn’t gain) equal to the damage roll’s 9s and 10s at the start of each of his turns. On decisive attacks, he suffers one die of lethal decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]], at the start of each of his turns. The difficulty of the gambit to remove the projectiles increases by +2. This ends when Stinging Ichneumon Scourge’s effect does.
