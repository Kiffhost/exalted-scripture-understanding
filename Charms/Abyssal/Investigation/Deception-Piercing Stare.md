*Having seen through the great lie of life, Death’s Lawgiver easily winnows falsehoods from truth.*
The Abyssal can tell if someone is lying when he makes a statement. If the statement contains partial or incomplete truths, she discerns which parts of the statement are false or misleading.
Against magic capable of contesting this perfect discernment, the Abyssal rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Investigation]]) for her opposed roll, adding ([[Essence]]) automatic successes. The opposing character’s 1s and 2s subtract successes from his roll.
