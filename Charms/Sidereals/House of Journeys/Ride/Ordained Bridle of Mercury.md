The Sidereal shapes yellow stardust into a bridle with reins and bit, a tether to bind a new mount to her fate. When the Sidereal presents the bridle to an animal, she makes a special ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Ride) persuade roll against it. If she succeeds, the animal accepts the bridle, which vanishes once it is placed, making that animal the Sidereal’s familiar and giving it a Major Tie of submission to her. She must pay a one-Willpower surcharge to present the bridle to animals that would be two-dot familiars (Exalted, p. 161), and it can’t be used against animals that would be three-dot familiars or animals that are already someone’s familiar. Alternatively, instead of choosing an animal to present the bridle to, the Sidereal may let fate decide. An animal of the Storyteller’s choice will enter the scene and let the Sidereal place the bridle on it without needing to roll. The Storyteller can choose animals that are two- or even three-dot familiars, without requiring the Willpower surcharge.
