The bond between the Dragon-Blood and her mount isn’t easily broken. This Charm can be used to defend against an unhorse gambit. 1s on the attack roll subtract successes, and the difficulty of the gambit increases by 1. In Wood Aura, this Charm’s duration lasts as long as the Exalt remains in Aura.
