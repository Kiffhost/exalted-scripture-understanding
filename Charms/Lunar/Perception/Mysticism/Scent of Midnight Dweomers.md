The Lunar recognizes the Wyld’s sickly-sweet aroma, the exotic spices of Malfeas, the Underworld’s rotting stench, and more. She rolls (Perception + Occult). One success reveals boundaries between Creation and other worlds, such as entrances to spirit sanctums or the border of a shadowland or Wyld zone, and the realms they lead to. One success also lets her detect the presence of ongoing sorcerous or necromantic effects, while (Circle x2) successes lets her identify a spell or working’s function. She can identify the aspect, function, and properties of a hearthstone, demesne, or manse with 3 successes if it’s standard, or 5 successes if it’s greater. The Lunar can also determine the nature of a spirit or fae she can perceive by scent with (his Essence) successes. If such an entity is disguised as another type of being, add its disguise successes to the difficulty of identifying it.
