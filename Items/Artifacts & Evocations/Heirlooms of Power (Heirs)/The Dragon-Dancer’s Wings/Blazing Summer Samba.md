*The wielder dances as if fire licked under her every step, and leaves a blazing path in her wake.*
She converts any bonus dice from her [[Appearance]] on a dance-based [[Performance]] roll to non-Charm successes. If she rolls 3+ successes, she ignites a fiery environmental hazard within close range that has Damage (Essence/2, rounded up) L/round and difficulty 3. The flames subside at the end of the wielder’s next turn unless she successfully uses this Evocation again. The wielder is immune to these flames.
If the wielder flurries the enhanced [[Performance]] roll with an attack, she catches the ignited flames on the DragonDancer’s [[Wings]], adding +1 Overwhelming on withering attacks and doubling 10s on decisive damage rolls.
This Evocation is incompatible with [[Boreal Winds Grace]] and [[Soothing Snowfall Waltz]].
