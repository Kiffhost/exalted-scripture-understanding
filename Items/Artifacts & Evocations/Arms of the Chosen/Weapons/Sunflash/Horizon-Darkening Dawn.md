Sunflash abides no rivals to its own light, snuffing out any flame that dares compete against it. This Evocation adds Sunflash’s anima level in bonus successes to a withering damage roll. It also extinguishes any mundane light sources — such as torches, lanterns, or campfires — that [[Sunflash]] passes within short range of on its path to the target. If the wielder deals withering damage to an enemy with a flaring anima banner, [[Sunflash]] steals one level of anima from that character, siphoning it into its own banner. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with orichalcum, this Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder successfully ambushes at medium range or further with it.
