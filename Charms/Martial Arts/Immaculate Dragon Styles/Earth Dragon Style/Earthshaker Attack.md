*The ground trembles beneath the Immaculate’s blow as she drives her tetsubo or stomping foot into the ground.*
To use this Charm, the Immaculate must have [[Initiative]] 15+. She makes a single decisive attack roll against all other characters in short range, including allies. This attack is unblockable, undodgeable, and can’t be clashed. Instead, each character in range must make a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) opposed roll against the Immaculate’s attack to maintain his balance. A character who fails is knocked prone and suffers ([[Strength]]) dice of bashing damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t include the Immaculate’s [[Initiative]] or reset her to base. Battle groups with [[Might]] 0 fail the roll automatically. Enemies that take 3+ levels of damage are knocked back one range band with immense force, suffering damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232). 
In Earth Aura, after paying this Charm’s cost, the Immaculate may divide her total [[Initiative]] evenly among each hit enemy, rounded up, adding it on top of this Charm’s base damage of ([[Strength]]). Doing so resets her to base [[Initiative]] as long as at least one enemy is hit. 
## Reset
This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing a nontrivial foe while he’s prone.
