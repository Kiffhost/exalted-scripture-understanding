Broken Thunder forged this armor for Shadow-of-Mars to guard her as she set off on the Eight Directions Embassy, traveling to every corner of Creation and beyond as an emissary of the Exalted Host. She wore it as she entreated Western Fair Folk nobles to endorse the Formless Concordance, as she sailed into Old Stygia’s bleak harbor to pay deference to the Dual Monarchs, and as her sandship skimmed across the Endless Desert toward an audience with the Demon City’s princes. Through every storm and quake, through all the bluster and blandishments, she remained true to her mission, and the armor remained true to her. Centuries later, older and wiser, Shadow-of-Mars set traveling aside to make her home in Asmay on the Isle of Nine Cities, near Luthe. She passed [[Baldaquin]] to a new generation of Quicksilver Falcons, that they might be likewise protected as they traveled the Great Western Ocean and realms beyond in service to the newly established Deliberative. Each rondel on this suit of small orichalcum plates bears the insignia of the nigh-mythical Eight Directions Embassy — eight arrows radiating outward from the Imperial Mountain. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Baldaquin]]

While the Exalt travels in order to act as an intermediary or advocate for another, she adds ([[Essence]]) bonus dice to all rolls to endure or bypass hostile environments and hazards.
