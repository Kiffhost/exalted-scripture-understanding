*The Abyssal’s strikes carry the touch of remembered plague.*
When the Abyssal makes a successful decisive attack, she exposes her victim to her choice of any mundane disease she has ever suffered or treated. Its morbidity and virulence are increased to (Medicine) if that’s higher.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can contaminate food or water, tainting enough to expose a single victim to the disease.
With Medicine 5, Essence 2, the Abyssal may repurchase this Charm to add a supernatural disease she’s suffered or treated to her repertoire. She can do so for multiple diseases. She must pay a one-Willpower surcharge to inflict a supernatural disease.
