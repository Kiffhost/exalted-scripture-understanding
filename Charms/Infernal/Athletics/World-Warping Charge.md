*The world contorts around the Infernal’s fury as she moves, bending and breaking as she wills.*

The Infernal reflexively makes a feat of demolition to destroy an obstacle that stands in the way of her moving between range bands. She adds (Strength) non-Charm successes on the roll and adds (Essence) to her effective Strength to determine what feats she can attempt.

A successful feat destroys objects by warping and distorting them, rather than breaking them. A few seconds later, they snap back to how they were, undamaged. The Infernal can make the distortion permanent if she rolls 3+ extra successes, but only if she met its Strength minimum without this Charm’s bonus.
## Reset
The Infernal can’t use this Charm more than once per range band of movement.
### Key
#### Rippling Reality Tread (Athletics 4, Essence 2) (+2m)
For a two-mote surcharge, the Infernal’s passage also distorts difficult terrain, letting her pass through unhindered without needing to roll a feat of demolition. She still needs a feat to make the disruption permanent.
