Stirring the air with the Dragon-Dancer’s Wings, the wielder lulls the world to sleep beneath a freezing wind.
When she makes a dance-based Performance roll, her targets treat their emotion-based Intimacies as one level lower for purposes of adding to Resolve or resisting in Decision Points. If she rolls 3+ successes, she may freeze the ground beneath her to create a patch of difficult terrain, or raise up a wall of ice within close range that counts as heavy cover (Exalted, p. 199). The wielder isn’t impeded by this difficult terrain, though enemies can benefit from the cover against her.
If the wielder flurries the enhanced Performance roll with a full defense, ice limns the fans, adding +1 Parry against the next attack against her before her next turn.
