[[Demesne]] [[Manse]]
It takes six hours of meditation and careful co-mingling of [[Essence]] to attune to and claim ownership of an unclaimed demesne. The owner of a demesne can reflexively sense all attempts to attune to the demesne while present, and may automatically block them, permit them as sub-attunements which grant attunement benefits without bestowing ownership, or may even allow ownership to be taken. She can also sever any existing attunements with a moment’s concentration and a difficulty 3 ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) roll. While the owner remains attuned but not present, she may remotely sense attempts to attune to the demesne, but may not block them; they automatically succeed as sub-attunements.
Attunement to (and ownership of) a demesne fades (character’s [[Essence]]) weeks after leaving its boundaries. Attunement to a manse functions in the same fashion, save that it takes (character’s [[Essence]]) months for attunement to lapse, and attunement will never lapse if the character is carrying the manse’s [[Merits/Hearthstone]].
