*The necromancer draws forth the shadow of death that exists in all living things, transforming her foe into a foreshadowing of his own corpse.*
The necromancer rolls ({[[Intelligence]] or [[Manipulation]]} + [[Occult]]) against the [[Resolve]] of a living character within medium range. Success transforms his appearance into an illusion of his own corpse, with the necromancer choosing the means of his apparent death — withered by age, covered in stab wounds, marked by deadly poxes, and so on. He gains the [[Hideous]] Merit (Exalted, p. 162) and others automatically perceive him as undead, treating him accordingly. Characters prompted by an [[Intimacy]] towards the target or external evidence can attempt to see through this illusion with a difficulty 5 ([[Perception]] + {[[Awareness]], [[Investigation]], or [[Occult]]}) roll.
The victim must roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) against (necromancer’s [[Manipulation]] + 1) when presented with the opportunity to see his horrific reflection. He suffers a −2 penalty if doing so is especially easy, such as in a manse of mirror-polished marble or on the shore of a glassy lake. If he fails, he is transfixed by his own grim until he spends one [[Willpower]] to break free. In combat, he must take a miscellaneous action each round to observe his reflection. If he spends (necromancer’s [[Essence]], maximum 3) total [[Willpower]], he inures himself against this fixation, but doesn’t break the illusion.
Against mortals, this spell’s duration is indefinite, though the necromancer may proclaim a circumstance under which it breaks: when her victim slays one of her foes, swears his fealty to her, stands atop Mount Namas, and so on.
On ghosts, this spell can instead be used to change their natural forms, shaping their corpus to change the apparent nature of their death and associated cosmetic supernatural features.
## Control
The necromancer may spend three motes or one [[Willpower]] to change her apparent age, inflict herself with cosmetic wounds and afflictions, or appear either dead or alive. This grants her (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) non-Charm dice to appropriate [[disguise]] rolls. This transformation lasts until she chooses to end it.
## Distortion (9)
The illusion is lessened for the scene, removing the [[Hideous]] merit and allowing the character to see their reflection without incident. Characters still perceive them as undead.
