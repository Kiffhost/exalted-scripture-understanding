Grown in the gardens of Yu-Shan, these peaches are fabled for their youth-restoring efficacy. A peach is eaten in three bites. For most characters, including mortals and Dragon-Blooded, each bite undoes ten years of aging, while eating a whole peach restores them to their physical prime. For the long-lived Solar, Lunar, and [[Sidereal Exalted]], a single bite undoes a century of age, while an entire peach undoes a millennium. This will never revert a character back before the physical prime of youth. Note that while Sidereals can reclaim youth with these peaches, they cannot outlive their allotted span. (Exalted, p. 34).
