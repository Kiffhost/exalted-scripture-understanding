The Sidereal mirrors her enemy’s hostility, wreathing her fists in baleful radiance. The Sidereal’s attack adds (lower of her Strength or enemy’s Essence) dice to of post-soak withering damage or decisive damage. Against enemies of fate, she isn’t limited by her Strength and her decisive attacks deal aggravated damage.
