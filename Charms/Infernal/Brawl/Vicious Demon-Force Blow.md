*The Infernal strikes with strength born of cruelty, relishing her victim’s pain.*

The Infernal adds (Strength/2, rounded up) to a withering attack’s Overwhelming. If the attack hits, her target loses an additional (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) Initiative. The Infernal doesn’t gain this Initiative unless it crashes her target. She also gains it if she makes a savaging withering attack against a grappled enemy.
