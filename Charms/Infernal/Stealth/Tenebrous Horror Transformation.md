*The Infernal dissolves into inky darkness, a thing of shifting, amorphous shadows.*

The Infernal’s umbral transformation grants the following benefits:
- In darkness or shadow deep enough to impose a visibility penalty, she adds dice equal to the penalty on Stealth rolls, movement actions, and unexpected attack rolls.
- She also adds the above bonus on damage rolls for unexpected attacks, adding decisive or post-soak withering damage.
- She lowers the penalty for Stealth rolls in combat by one.
- At the end of each round, if she’s within close range of an enemy who can’t perceive her, she gains one Initiative.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she uses [[Noon-as-Night Invocation]].
