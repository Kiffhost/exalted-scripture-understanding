Clash Attacks are a special roll used when two characters [[Attack]] one another on the same [[Time#Tick|tick]]. In these situations, the quality of a character’s defensive prowess becomes irrelevant—victory goes to the fighter whose strike is superior. 

Clash Attacks ignore both characters’ [[Defense]]. Instead, the two attacks act as an [[Dice Rolls#Opposed roll|opposed roll]]. The character who accumulates more [[Dice Rolls#Successes|successes]] wins, striking his opponent, while the loser’s attack is thwarted. 

Finally, in addition to suffering damage, the loser of the Clash Attack suffers a -2 penalty to Defense until their next turn.
# Withering
If a Clash Attack is [[Attack#withering|withering]], then it adds the [[Dice Rolls#Threshold Successes|threshold by which the winning fighter beat his opponent’s roll]] to its [[Attack#raw damage|raw damage]]. A successful withering Clash attack adds 3 additional points of [[Initiative#Damage]] *after* damage is rolled. 

# Decisive
A successful [[Attack#decisive|decisive]] Clash attack adds 1 automatic point of Health Track damage after damage is rolled.
