*The Sidereal’s battle prowess is all-encompassing, drawing no distinction between weapons.*
The Sidereal can wield weapons with the [[Martial Arts]] tag (Exalted, p. 586) using an appropriate Ability. This is typically [[Melee]], but those similar to [[Brawl]] weapons may be compatible with it — e.g., wind and fire wheels could be used with [[Brawl]] or [[Melee]]. Ranged weapons, like [[Meteor Hammer|meteor hammers]] (p. XX), use the Ability they’re tagged with. For two motes, the Sidereal may reflexively ready a weapon. This cost is waived when she changes from a weapon of one Ability to another (including [[Martial Arts]] weapons rendered compatible with other Abilities).
