The wind bears the Dragon-Blood’s sight aloft, elevating her perspective. She sees the world around her from a bird’s-eye view, as though she were looking down from a point at long range above herself. She can see her surroundings out to long range horizontally from herself, unless environmental conditions or obstructions block some or all of this range. She cannot see from her normal perspective, but neither does she suffer any penalties that only apply to it rather than her line of sight from above — a blindfold or a maimed eye would be no obstacle, nor would a stone wall as long as the other side were within her vision’s range. However, she may still suffer penalties or be unable to see certain areas entirely as a result of obstructions to her bird’s-eye perspective: dense fog, low-lying clouds, foliage, roofs, and the like (though she may use magic like Cloud-Piercing Focus to negate applicable obstacles). The Dragon-Blood’s other senses aren’t affected.
The Dragon-Blood adds an automatic success on any Perception-based rolls she makes to look for or examine anything larger than a single person from this perspective, such as spotting a concealed battle group or surveying the architecture of a palace. When making command actions (Exalted, p. 209), she can roll with (Perception + War) as long as she’s able to perceive the battle group she’s commanding, and adds an automatic success on such rolls.
