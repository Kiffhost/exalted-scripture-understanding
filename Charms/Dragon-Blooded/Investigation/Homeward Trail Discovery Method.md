*Both dragons and thieves take great interest in tending to their lairs; neither can hide from the vigilant magistrate.*
Once the Dragon-Blood has used this Charm’s prerequisite to determine that a character lives in a location, this Charm activates when she comes in sight of a door or other entryway into his home. In her perspective, the entryway briefly flashes blue with the [[Essence]] of air, automatically revealing it to her. If she rolls to pick a lock, force a door, or otherwise secure her entry by physically manipulating an entrance, she doubles 9s on the first such roll.
