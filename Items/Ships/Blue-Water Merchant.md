This model of ship is broadly representative of the longrange merchant vessels that ply the waters of the Great Western Ocean, carrying cargo from port to port, or transporting troops to distant shores. Pirates also occasionally prize these ships for their balance between speed and maneuverability, but tend to pair them with scout ships, operating in packs.
# Role
Seagoing merchant vessel; troop carrier
# Cargo
2,000 tons or more. Troop transports carry 125 soldiers and their gear in lower-decks stowage.
