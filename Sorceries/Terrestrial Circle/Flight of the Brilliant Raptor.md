*The sorcerer shapes flames of diamond and ruby into the form of a majestic bird of prey, evoking the elemental majesty of the garda birds.*
The player rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) as a decisive attack against an enemy at up to long range, then sends the raptor streaking forth to consume her foe in deadly flames. The brilliant raptor embodies the sorcererâ€™s will, with a base lethal damage equal to (her [[Initiative]] + current temporary [[Willpower]]), and resets her to base [[Initiative]] on a successful attack. As long as the raptor deals 3+ levels of damage to its target, it ignites a bonfire (p. 230) that engulfs him and all terrain within short range of him, and burns until the end of the scene. 

A sorcerer who knows [[Flight of the Brilliant Raptor]] as her control spell may use it to attack a target one range band beyond long range by paying an extra 5sm when casting the spell.
