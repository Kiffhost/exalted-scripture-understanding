Forged to be a legendary thief, worn by a legendary thief, Sozen conveys mastery of its art. This Evocation enhances the following [[Charms]] as described below: 
- Picking a sorcerous lock with [[Lock-Opening Touch]] (Exalted, p. 317) doubles 8s, while the cost of opening a mundane lock is reduced by two motes. 
- The Solar gains ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on the roll to use [[Master Plan Meditation]] (Exalted, p. 318). 
- Once per day, she may waive the [[Willpower]] cost of [[Door-Evading Technique]] (Exalted, p. 321).
