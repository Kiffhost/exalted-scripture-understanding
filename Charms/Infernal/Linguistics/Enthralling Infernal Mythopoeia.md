*The Infernal writes of a world more compelling than reality, a paradise that imprisons those who read it long after they’ve finished the last page.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Linguistics) influence roll to pen a story, poem, or other text that ensnares its readers’ minds. Characters affected by this influence gain a Major Obsession with reading other texts written by her, convincing others to do the same, and seeking her attention (Exalted, p. 169). The Obsession is Defining if a character has a Defining Intimacy that supports the influence.

The Obsession’s Resolve penalty applies against any written influence the Infernal uses and is increased by one against her influence. The Obsession fades away once the target has spent (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) Willpower resisting it.

If an affected character already has an Obsession from this Charm, its intensity is increased by one step instead. This resets the target’s count of Willpower spent resisting the Derangement to determine when this Psyche effect ends.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used against a character once per story.
