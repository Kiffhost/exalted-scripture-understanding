*Seeing the world around her with utter clarity, the Lunar draws power from the perfection of her senses.*
When she succeeds on a [[Perception]] roll to detect a concealed enemy or hidden danger, she gains motes equal to the 9s and 10s on her roll. This can’t exceed the number of motes spent enhancing the roll. If the Lunar knows [[Understanding the Prey]] (p. XX), this Charm also benefits read intentions and profile character rolls.
