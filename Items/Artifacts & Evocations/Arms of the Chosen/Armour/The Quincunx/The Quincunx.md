*Forged in the High First Age by the renowned [[Twilight]] sorcerer Devon, who believed that the secrets of the universe could be harnessed with careful mathematical reckoning, the Quincunx put to rest any claims that a sorcerer could not hold his own on the battlefield. When his Circlemate, the [[Dawn]] warrior Kati, plunged headlong into Malfeas alone to settle a score with a demon lord, Devon saw little choice but to gird himself for battle and follow, donning the Quincunx as a sorcerous defense against the alien geometries he would encounter there. The breastplate was buried along with its creator and lies entombed still, waiting for the hand that will awaken its mystical potential once more.* 
This breastplate consists of two perfectly symmetrical pentagonal plates of burnished orichalcum. Both are inlaid with resonant crystals aligned in significant occult patterns and inscribed with runes. The front plate has one hearthstone socket in the center of the prominent quincunx pattern that gives the artifact its name. The breastplate is worn over a long, high-collared tunic with flared sleeves, lined with the fur and [[Essence]] of five huraka. The sorcerer who dons this armor can calculate his opponent’s next move and capture mystical energies to power acts of occult might. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the Quincunx

A character attuned to the Quincunx gains +1 [[Defense]] while shaping [[sorcery]], attempting countermagic, or distorting a spell. A [[Twilight]] Caste Solar at bonfire anima may pay six motes and one [[Willpower]] to harmonize her anima banner with the Quincunx, stacking its [[Hardness]] bonus with the armor’s for the rest of the scene.
