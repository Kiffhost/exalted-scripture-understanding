Even if its master can barely stand, Seven Fangs Caged forces her body to obey her will, moonsilver doing what muscle cannot. When she uses Frenzied Desperation Strike (p. XX), she adds her wound penalty both to the attack’s damage roll and to her Initiative after resetting if successful. Frenzied Desperation Strike is reset the first time in a scene she takes damage to a −4 health level. 

## Resonant

If Relentless Lunar Fury is active, waive Frenzied Desperation Strike’s Willpower cost.
