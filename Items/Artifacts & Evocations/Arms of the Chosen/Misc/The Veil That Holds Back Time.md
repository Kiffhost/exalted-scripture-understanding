*This sheet of pale gauzy fabric, three yards on a side, scarcely conceals whatever it covers.*
Said to have been woven from the cocoon of what would become the Butterfly Star, its gossamer fabric is delicate enough that an infant could tear it. The veil has one simple, subtle power: Anything it covers is unaffected by the passage of time, utterly immune to decay. A living creature is frozen between one breath and the next: alive but unmoving, unthinking, undreaming, not perceiving the passage of moments or centuries. Lifting or disarraying the veil returns what it covers to the natural flow of time. A living being must be immobile — either willing, paralyzed, or unconscious — to be affected, lest his struggles rend the veil and destroy its magic.
