*The Sidereal weaves her blueprints into the pattern of fate, ensuring her project’s swift completion.*
The Sidereal undertakes a basic or major project, completing most such tasks in a matter of minutes as long as she has all necessary tools and materials. The most arduous, work-intensive projects can be completed in an hour if basic or a day if major. A [[Craft]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Sidereal pay a two-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to undertake superior projects with this Charm. Creating artifacts require ([[Artifact]] – 1) months, or half that for repairs; the time to complete a manse is halved; mundane large-scale projects can be completed in no more than (10 – [[Essence]]) weeks. She can’t use this Charm to create N/A artifacts or First Age artifice.
