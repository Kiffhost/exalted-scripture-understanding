*The Sidereal’s weapon unspools into a shimmering yellow strand of needle-sharp [[Essence]], piercing both armor and soul.*
The Sidereal’s attack ignores her enemy’s soak and [[Hardness]] (including any from armor). Instead, he’s treated as having soak ([[Resolve]] + current temporary [[Willpower]]) and [[Hardness]] ([[Resolve]]) against the attack, if these are lower than his own values. He can raise these values further with applicable magic.
