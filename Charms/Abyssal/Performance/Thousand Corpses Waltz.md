*The Abyssal leaves ballrooms strewn with the severed limbs and moldering remains of her dance partners.*
As long as the Abyssal dances while in battle, she gains the following benefits:
 - If she makes a reflexive [[move]] action, [[rush]], or [[disengage]] action on her turn, she doesn’t need a separate action to continue her performance.
 - She gains +1 [[Defense|Evasion]] against enemies whose [[Resolve]] is lower than her [[Appearance]].
 - If she attacks an enemy whose [[Resolve]] is lower than her [[Appearance]], she adds non-Charm dice equal to the difference on the attack roll and damage roll, maximum ([[Essence]]).
 - If she beats an enemy’s [[Resolve]] with an influence roll, any attacks she makes against him become surprise attacks until the end of her next turn.
 - When she gains [[Initiative]] from [[Macabre Dancer’s Rhythm]], her enemy loses that much [[Initiative]].
