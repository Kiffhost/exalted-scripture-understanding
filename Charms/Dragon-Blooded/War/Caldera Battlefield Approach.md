*Reshaping the battlefield to her will, the Dragon-Blood calls great pillars of stone up from the earth, only to strike them with such tremendous force that they shatter and melt into lava.*
When she uses [[Ramparts of Obedient Earth]], she can create a lava hazard (difficulty 5, damage 6L/round) filling the space of an enemy battle group by spending (higher of its [[Size]] or 3) points.
Additionally, if the Dragon-Blood employs the Reshape Battefield option, she can create lava hazards for one point each, with each hazard extending out to close range from a point anywhere on the battlefield, so long as no nontrivial, non-battle-group enemies are caught in the hazard’s area when it forms.
If the Dragon-Blood wins [[Join Battle]], she can use [[Magma Hell Upheaval]] without needing to be in an Aura or expend one.
Once the scene ends, lava created with this Charm cools and hardens into obsidian.
