The Dragon-Blood settles into a rooted stance of evasion through non-evasion, unleashing a seismic wave of spiritual force. It’s not she who recedes, but her foes. She rolls her (Stamina + Dodge) against the Resolve of all enemies within close range as she unleashes incredible spiritual pressure. Each enemy whose Resolve is beaten must immediately make a disengage roll opposing her at a −3 penalty. On a success, an enemy must immediately use his reflexive movement to move away from the Dragon-Blood. On a failure, the only action he can take on subsequent turns is to continue disengaging from the Dragon-Blood until he succeeds, even if subsequently forced beyond close range. Characters may resist this for one Willpower and five Initiative. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless the Dragon-Blood resets it by beginning her turn at medium range or further from all enemies while in Earth Aura.
