*Ghostly nails rivet the Abyssal’s armor to her flesh while chains of spectral Essence coil around it, binding her in steel.*
The Abyssal seals herself in her armor. Its mobility penalty is reduced to zero as if it was an extension of her body. Light armor gains +1 soak, reinforced by spectral chains and rivets. Regardless of weight, artifact armor also gains +2 Hardness. When used with heavy armor, this Charm costs an additional two motes.
The Abyssal’s armor can’t be removed by any means while this Charm is active — not even her own efforts.
Mundane armor becomes as durable as an artifact.
Artifact armor’s attunement can’t be broken by magic.
To end this Charm, the Abyssal must rip herself free of her armor, using the normal rules for removing it (Exalted, p.
591). This increases her wound penalty by −1 for the rest of the day. This isn’t necessary for armor created by magic like Wraith-Forged Plate once that armor fades away.
