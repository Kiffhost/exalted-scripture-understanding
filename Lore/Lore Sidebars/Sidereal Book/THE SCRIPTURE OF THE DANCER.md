Once, there was a maiden…
...who stood at the center of every dance.
Back then, she knew all the dances.
She never missed a step.
One day, she heard something in the music, as a
singer dropped the beat.
It taught her the joy of dancing poorly.
She started dancing more and more awry.
“Love has no rules,” she said.
