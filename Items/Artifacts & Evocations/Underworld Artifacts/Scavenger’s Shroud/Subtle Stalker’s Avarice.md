*The Shroud conceals its wearer from watchful eyes, letting her ply her subterfuge in secret.*
The wearer ignores up to two points of penalties on [[Larceny]] and [[Stealth]] rolls, except for the penalty for using [[Stealth]] in combat. If she makes a [[Larceny]] roll to steal something while concealed from her victim, she adds a non-Charm success.
