*The bleak saint embraces all who come to her, even if she must impale herself upon the blades they bear against her. This, too, is a lesson.*
The stylist can use this [[Charm]] after being hit by a [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack]], but before the damage roll. As long as her attacker rolls at least one success on the damage roll, she gains (his [[Essence]]) [[Initiative]]. If she takes enough damage to increase her [[Health Track#wound penalties|wound penalty]], she gains additional [[Initiative]] equal to her new base penalty. If the damage increases her wound penalty by multiple steps, she gains Initiative for each. She can’t be incapacitated by the attack, negating any excess damage.
Additionally, the stylist’s attacker treats the damage roll as a special [[instill]] roll against himself. He subtracts the stylist’s new base wound penalty from his [[Resolve]] against it. If his attack would have incapacitated her, he can’t assert his Resolve against it. If successful, this [[influence]] creates or strengthens a [[Intimacy|Principle]] representing a reason the attacker believed harming the stylist was justified, chosen by his player. At the end of each turn, if he didn’t make an attack, he loses ([[Intimacy]]) [[Initiative]]. However, if he makes a decisive attack and misses, he also adds (Intimacy) to the amount of Initiative he loses. He must pay one [[Willpower]] to end hostilities before all opposition is dead or fled.
Resisting this Charm’s Psyche effect costs one Willpower and five Initiative. Doing so renders an enemy immune for the rest of the scene, though the stylist can still use this Charm to gain Initiative from his attacks.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by going two consecutive rounds without taking a [[movement]] action.
Being forcibly moved or knocked [[prone]] by an enemy also disrupts this reset.
