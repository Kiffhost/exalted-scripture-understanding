Every word the Dragon-Blood has ever written is engraved into her soul, giving her the strength to defy. In a Decision Point (Exalted, p. 221), she may call upon a novel, collection of poetry, or other long-form written work she’s completed over the course of the chronicle. Her player summarizes the work’s theme or moral in a short phrase, which she treats as a Major Intimacy in the Decision Point. The Dragon-Blood can’t invoke the same work twice — she must continue writing to maintain her resolve. Works that have already played a significant narrative part in the Dragon-Blood’s story carry a stronger weight, and count as Defining Intimacies. This includes any work whose completion fulfilled a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) or legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134), or any other work the Storyteller agrees is sufficiently meaningful. In Earth Aura, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Aura state in place of the Willpower cost to resist influence in a Decision point.
