*The Infernal scourges unrighteous lands with devastation, laying low kingdoms that refuse to praise her name.*

The Infernal creates a flesh-scouring sandstorm, extending out to medium range from her. It’s an environmental hazard with difficulty 6, Damage (Essence + 1)L. Blinding sand inflicts a −1 penalty on vision-based rolls. The hazard doesn’t affect the Infernal or characters with Ties of reverence to her. It expands outward by one range band at the start of each of the Infernal’s turns, up to an initial maximum of (Essence + 5) bands, extending into extreme range.

If the Infernal sustains this Charm for an hour, the sandstorm becomes a calamity, extending out to one mile. She may have it take on the semblance of her iconic anima banner whenever she pleases. It’s no longer tied to her location — it moves as she wills, at a speed of (higher of Essence or 3) miles per hour. In combat, she can use her movement action to reflexively move it two range bands. The Storyteller determines how much damage it deals to mundane scenery and trivial opponents, up to uncountable damage. The Infernal can maintain this sandstorm for up to (Essence) hours. All characters within the sandstorm are instinctively aware they can escape it by forming a Tie of reverence to its creator.

This Charm ends if the Infernal is crashed or incapacitated, allowing foes to prevent the sandstorm from growing into a calamity. Noticing something unusual about the forming sandstorm requires a difficulty 5 (Perception + {Awareness, Occult, or Survival}) roll from a mile off, or difficulty 3 if they’re nearby.
## Reset
Once per story. No reset is required if this Charm is disrupted before the calamity forms.
