The Lunar recognizes the sweet perfume of miracles and the vile stench of damnation. She can use Scent of Midnight Dweomers to detect traces of Essence left by the use of magic, or by an anima banner flaring to bonfire, with a difficulty equal to the number of months that have elapsed since the event occurred, minimum 1. Success reveals that the event occurred and how long ago it happened. She may spend extra successes among the following options, in any order: 
-  1 extra success: Determine the responsible character’s Essence rating. 
-  1 extra success: Determine whether the responsible character is her Solar mate. 
-  2 extra successes: Discern the responsible character’s general nature — e.g., whether he’s a god, demon, raksha, Dragon-Blood, Sidereal, or something mysterious and unclassifiable. 
-  2 extra success: If the Lunar knows Catching the Prey’s Scent (p. XX), memorize the responsible character’s scent. 
-  4 extra successes: After determining the responsible character’s general nature, determine his identity if she’s already familiar with him. 
-  (Charm’s minimum Essence) extra successes: After detecting the use of a spirit Charm, discern its general function and the purpose it was used for. 
-  (Circle x 2) extra successes: After detecting the use of a spell, discern its general function and the purpose it was used for. 
-  (Artifact) extra successes; 10 if N/A: After detecting the use of an artifact’s Evocation, discern its general effect and the nature of the artifact it belongs to.
