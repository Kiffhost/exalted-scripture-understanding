*The Abyssal embodies death’s eternal perfection, unmarred by anything less than annihilation.*
When the Abyssal is hit by an attack, she can use this Charm before the damage roll to diminish any crippling effects the attack inflicts. Any penalties she suffers from it are halved, rounded down, and it heals completely in (7 – [[Stamina]]) rounds.
This Charm doesn’t apply when the Abyssal’s player chooses to take a crippling injury, unless the choice was forced by magic like [[Artful Maiming Onslaught]].
