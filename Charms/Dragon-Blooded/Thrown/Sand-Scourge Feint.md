A sandstorm spits forth to swirl around the Dragon-Blood’s weapon in flight, harrying her foe. She makes a distract gambit. If successful, the gambit’s victim loses [[Initiative]] equal to the gambit’s [[Initiative]] cost. If this crashes him, the [[Initiative]] Break is awarded to the beneficiary of the gambit, instead of the Dragon-Blood.
In Earth Aura, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Aura in lieu of paying the gambit’s [[Initiative]] cost.
