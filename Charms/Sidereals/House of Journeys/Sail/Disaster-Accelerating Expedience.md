Tugging at the thread of a crisis that yet awaits her, the Sidereal pulls it forward — why put off for tomorrow what can be done today? Upon learning of some future danger, suffering, or disaster that she’s likely to face in the future, the Sidereal rolls (Intelligence + Sail) to ensure it happens sooner than normally would. The difficulty depends on how far in the future that disaster lies: difficulty 1 for days, difficulty 3 for weeks, difficulty 5 for months, 7 for years, or 10 for anything more. If the disaster is the result of magic like God-King’s Shrike, she makes an opposed roll instead. Additionally, if accelerating the disaster requires changes in the decisions of nontrivial characters, the Sidereal’s roll must beat their Resolve and leverage at least a Minor Intimacy. They can enter a Decision Point to resist for one Willpower, unconsciously breaking from the course fate has prepared for them. If the Sidereal succeeds, the disaster occurs at the next dramatically appropriate sunrise or sunset. Though it comes early, it’s diminished or flawed in some way that gives the Sidereal a significant advantage in overcoming it, taking into consideration the reduced time to prepare for it. A mutiny occurs before her entire crew turns against her; the assassin sent against her turns out to be mortal rather than an outcaste; a hurricane befalls her ship while it’s near a refuge where the storm can be more easily weathered. Overcoming the challenge counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX). Additionally, fate ensures the Sidereal won’t face a similar peril for a year and a day, barring magical intervention. They may loom in her future, like an impending mutiny, but won’t boil over into outright disaster until that time’s passed.
