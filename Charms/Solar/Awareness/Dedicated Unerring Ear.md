*The Lawgivers can listen across vast spaces for the sound of a favored voice.*
The Exalt must have activated [[Keen Hearing and Touch Technique]] in order to use this Charm. Upon doing so, the Exalt becomes aware any time she is addressed by someone for whom she holds a Major or Defining positive [[Intimacy]], no matter how far away he is. So long as she’s on the same plane of existence as they are, the Solar can hear the words of her favored people clearly, as if they were in the same room, so long as they are addressing their speech to her. This Charm’s duration is Indefinite: each time a character addresses the Solar, she has an instant in which she feels a tingle in the base of her skull, telling her to tune her hearing and listen. Upon activating the Charm, she can hear everything her compatriot wishes to say to her, until the character has been silent for ten seconds or longer. The cost of this Charm cannot be reduced by its prerequisite.
