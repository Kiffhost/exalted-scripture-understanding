Armor is inherently complex. It takes ({armor’s mobility penalty} +1) minutes to put a suit of armor on. Characters who rush can don armor in half that time, but any botch the player later rolls almost certainly indicates that something has gone wrong—a poorly fastened strap may have come undone, or an inadequately tightened greave may have turned around. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this botch can deprive a character of the armor’s benefits or cause her significant penalties, like adding -1 or -2 to the armor’s mobility penalty as it hangs awkwardly on her body.
Removing armor takes half as long as donning it, which may be important if the character is busy trying to get out of her armor in a hurry to e.g. avoid drowning or hide it from the guards outside in the corridor. Rushing armor removal halves the time required but doubles the time needed to don it again.
