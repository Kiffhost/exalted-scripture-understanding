# [[Toad Style]]
Toad style emphasizes defense above all else. Its stylists wear no armor, but their skin is said to be hard as iron. They go through grueling training regimens to toughen their bodies, enduring countless repeated blows until they can withstand them without flinching. Students also eat a variety of poisons and venoms to cultivate resilience and heighten their understanding of toxins. Some even develop the [[Venomous]] Merit (Exalted, p. 167) as a result.
This style is widely practiced throughout the East, Southwest, and the Blessed Isle, and in parts of the West. It’s sometimes known as Frog style, especially in tropical Eastern forests where colorful poison dart frogs thrive. Its defensive techniques are sometimes studied to complement other styles; Snake and Mantis are common combinations.
## Weapons
Toad style’s offense focuses on delivering a single powerful blow rather than rapid flurries, using punches, palm strikes and kicks. It’s incompatible with weapons.
## Armour
Toad style is incompatible with armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Resistance]] is key to Toad style’s defense. The style’s [[Charms]] don’t use [[Medicine]], but it’s good to have if you’re going to poison yourself
