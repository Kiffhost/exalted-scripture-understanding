*The Infernal slams her foot down with the force of a falling star.*

The Infernal rolls a special feat of demolition to unleash a shockwave against all scenery and unattended objects within medium range. Characters caught in this shockwave must make a (Dexterity + Dodge) roll with a difficulty equal to half the Infernal’s successes. If they fail, they’re knocked one range band away from the Infernal and fall prone. She can’t choose to exempt objects or characters from this effect — her destructive force doesn’t allow for precise control.
## [[Keys]]
#### Destruction Beast Stampede (+4i)
For a four Initiative surcharge, enemies who fail their roll also suffer four dice of bashing damage as an environmental hazard.
#### All Attend the King
The Infernal can use this Charm to instead draw everything within medium range toward her with the force of her spiritual pressure. Enemies who fail their roll are drawn toward the Infernal, rather than knocked back. Enemies already at close range lose one Initiative for each success they failed by, maximum (Infernal’s Essence + 2).
