*Construing the distance between herself and a loved one as an attack, the Sidereal deftly steps around it.*
The Sidereal extends Trouble Reduction Strategy’s range to short. When an ally she’s protecting with it is attacked, she may pay two Initiative to move one range band toward him if this brings her within range to protect him. This doesn’t count as her move action.
If the Sidereal moves toward a nontrivial enemy with this reflexive movement and then successfully defends her ward, she gains one Initiative.
