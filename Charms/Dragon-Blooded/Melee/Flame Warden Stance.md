*The Dragon-Blood’s gleaming blade flickers into place between her allies and her enemies.*
She takes a defend other action (Exalted, p. 196) that extends its benefits to one scene, without needing to take the defend other action again on subsequent turns. Her ward must be within close range to benefit, but this Charm doesn’t end if he moves out of range. In Fire Aura, each time the Dragon-Blood parries an attack against her ward, she adds one bonus die to his next attack roll.
