*Some dare to hope they’ve struck down the Infernal, only to discover their triumph is an illusion.*

The Infernal perfectly defends against a ranged attack, revealing that the projectile is only an illusion, a figment of her attacker’s imagination. If the attack hits her, she suffers (attacker’s Essence) unsoakable withering damage, but suffers no other harm. She may seem to be struck and wounded, but this is likewise revealed as illusion.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by using [[Firefly Arrowhead Grip]] to successfully clash a decisive attack made by an enemy with 20+ Initiative.
