Cover raises a character’s [[Defense]] against attacks by 1 for [[#Light]] cover or 2 for [[#Heavy]] cover. [[#Full]] cover makes ranged attacks impossible. Attackers at close range also enjoy equal cover against attacks from the character in cover— crossing blades across a fence or around a tree is equally impairing for both parties.

Cover is subject to common-sense limitations. A wall provides cover only to opponents on the other side, for example.
# Light
+1 [[Defense]]. Light cover protects a significant portion of the character’s body, such as leaning into a doorway or standing behind a waist-high wall.
# Heavy
+2 [[Defense]]. Heavy cover protects the majority of a character’s body, leaving at most part of the head and an arm and shoulder exposed. Shooting through an arrow slit would provide heavy cover.
# Full
Full cover protects the character’s entire body, it makes ranged attacks impossible against them.
