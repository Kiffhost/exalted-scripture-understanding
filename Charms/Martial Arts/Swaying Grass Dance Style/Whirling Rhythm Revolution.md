Listening to the music pounding in her heart, the dancer whirls into an attack. Upon a successful rush, disengage, or dance-based Performance roll, she reflexively makes a decisive attack, which doesn’t count as her attack that round. The total mote cost of any Excellencies or other Swaying Grass Dance Charms used to enhance it are discounted by the number of motes spent enhancing the action that triggered it. 
## Terrestrial

The dancer’s attack doesn’t receive a mote discount and counts as her attack for the round.
