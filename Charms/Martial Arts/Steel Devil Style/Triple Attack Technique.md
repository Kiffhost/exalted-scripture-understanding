Moving with blazing speed, the Steel Devil makes three attacks in succession. This Charm upgrades Double Attack Technique, allowing extra successes from the second blow to roll over the target’s Defense again and create a third attack. If Triple Attack Technique is successful, add (Dexterity + Charge) to the attack’s base damage. This Charm can trigger Steel Devil Strike and Empty Mind Strike in an identical fashion to Double Attack Technique. 

## Terrestrial

When used by a Terrestrial, this Charm’s base damage is increased by the Exalt’s (Dexterity + [Charge/2, rounded down]). 

## Mastery

Reroll (Essence) non-successes on the attack’s damage roll.
