A master of the sublime, the Lawgiver hooks a mark with her charisma and genuine seeming. When used, this Charm supplements an instill action to make a person believe an object or structure belongs to the Exalt. This Charm cannot force an assertion on someone that directly contradicts what he knows. However, a character who does not know the truth cannot benefit from any Intimacies that would bolster his Resolve against the attempt. A character may not spend Willpower to contradict this belief unless he sees direct evidence to the contrary.
