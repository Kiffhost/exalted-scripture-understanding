Drifting Hawk Tactics Merciless Essence streaks from Hunting Hawkâ€™s taut string to the gleaming tip of an arrow, and thence into its target. This Evocation supplements an attack made from an elevated position above the target, allowing the Solar to re-roll a number of failed dice equal to her range bands of elevation above the target. If the attack succeeds, the Solar gains one point of Willpower, though this cannot raise her above her permanent Willpower rating. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation can only be awakened after the Solar has mastered at least 10 Archery Charms.
