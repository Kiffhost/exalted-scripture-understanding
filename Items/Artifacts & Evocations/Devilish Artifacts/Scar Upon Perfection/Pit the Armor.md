*The Scar melts through chain and plate that stands between its blade and flesh.*

The wielder can use this Evocation after dealing decisive damage to an armored foe. His armor suffers −2 soak and −2 Hardness, which increase to −(higher of wielder’s Essence or 3) against attacks enhanced by Sting the Guard. This lasts until the end of the scene for artifact armor, while mundane armor requires a repair project.

This Evocation’s penalty stacks. Artifact armor can’t be reduced below half its base soak or Hardness, rounded down, but there’s no limit against mundane armor. Reducing mundane armor’s soak to zero destroys it beyond repair, though it still inflicts a mobility penalty.

Against enemies with Principles or pride or vanity or Ties towards material objects, the penalty is increased by an additional point against attack enhanced by Sting the Guard.
