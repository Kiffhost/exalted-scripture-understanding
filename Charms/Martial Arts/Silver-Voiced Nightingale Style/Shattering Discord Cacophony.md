An eerie calm chills the Nightingale’s voice as she moves through countless scales of song, seeking to find the one deadly note that will unravel the Essence of her foe. The martial artist makes a difficulty 4 kiai gambit against an enemy. Every success on the Initiative roll delays that enemy’s next turn by one tick. The enemy’s physical form begins to decohere, his features become blurry and amorphous, trailing behind him in streaks as his very existence threatens to dissolve into nothing more than a few notes of music. Any decisive attack made against that enemy before he acts also adds one die to its raw damage for each success rolled on the Nightingale’s Initiative roll. If he’s incapacitated, the target’s body dissolves in a cacophony of disparate noises as his heart-song is ripped apart note by note, leaving only silence behind. 

## Mastery

The martial artist may breathe in the ruin of a destroyed enemy’s heartsong, making it a part of her own. This restores a number of motes equal to that character’s Essence, and provides the Nightingale with any knowledge she could have obtained with a read intentions action against that character. 

## Terrestrial

Only up to (Performance) successes on the Dragon-Blood’s Initiative roll are counted for determining how many dice of damage are added to her ally’s attacks.
