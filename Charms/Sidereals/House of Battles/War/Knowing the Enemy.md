The Sidereal sees her enemy’s true face revealed in his strategy. The Sidereal adds ([[Perception]]) dice on a Strategic Maneuver roll and ignores penalties for being unfamiliar with an enemy general or forces. She also treats her roll as a special read intentions opposing the enemy general’s [[Guile]]. Beating his [[Guile]] lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes over his [[Guile]]: 
-  What’s his motivation for fighting? 
-  What should I watch out for in the coming battle? 
-  What are his forces’ greatest weakness? 
-  Which of my positive Ties does he pose the greatest threat to? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if introducing a fact.
