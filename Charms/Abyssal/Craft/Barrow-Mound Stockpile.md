*Prolific in her dark craft, the Abyssal artisan is rarely found empty-handed.*
When the Abyssal uses Ceaseless Wicked Toil while facing a significant challenge, she can pay a seven-mote surcharge to reveal more dramatic contingency and preparation, as long as it could be completed with a single major project (Exalted, p. 239–240). Examples include a strategic cache of ammunition, a canoe concealed by a lakeside, or a lavish banquet awaiting unexpected visitors. This awards craft points like a major project, or a basic project if she fails the roll.
If this preparation’s larger than the Abyssal could carry on her person, her player declares a nearby location where it’s stashed. She can’t reveal something that would solve the challenge outright.
