*The martial artist brings the battle to a close with grim solemnity, dispatching foes to their appointed ends.*
The stylist’s attack adds (1 + enemy’s wound penalty) dice of post-soak withering damage or decisive damage. 
## Mastery
If the stylist’s attack increases her enemy’s wound penalty, she rolls an additional die of damage for each point his penalty increases.
