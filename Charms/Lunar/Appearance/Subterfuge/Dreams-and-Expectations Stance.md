Essential Mirror Nature Casting off the constraints of selfhood, the Lunar becomes a mirror of Essence, reflecting the unspoken hopes and fears of those who peer into her. She must use this Charm the instant she comes into someone’s view, causing him to perceive her as the person he most desires to see then (even if she isn’t currently in a human shape). She needn’t know the hoped-for individual’s identity, nor does she learn it. She reflexively rolls to disguise herself with (Appearance + [Larceny, Presence, or Socialize]), doubling 8s; the target can’t roll to contest it unless he has magically enhanced senses and the Lunar acts grossly out of character for the assumed persona.

## Special activation rules

The Lunar may stack this Charm to appear as multiple different people to different observers. Uses past the first cost only five motes, although these discounted activations end if the original activation ends. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as a Manipulation Charm.
