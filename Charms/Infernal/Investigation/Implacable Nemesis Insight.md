*No transgression is beneath the Infernal’s notice, no sin too small to draw her wrath.*

The Infernal makes a case scene or profile character roll in a handful of seconds, rerolling 6s until they cease to appear. If the roll aligns with an Intimacy based on suspicion, doubt, or paranoia, or one based on a desire for revenge, she also adds (Intimacy) automatic successes. If she already knows a culprit’s identity, she can also gain this bonus from any negative Tie toward him.
## [[Keys]]
#### Infallible Demon Judge
If a roll benefits from a Major or Defining Intimacy, the Infernal rerolls 5s as well as 6s. If she upholds such an Intimacy with a successful roll, she may exchange the Willpower she’d normally receive for an additional clue.
#### Imprecation of Accursed Sinners (Investigation 5, Essence 2, [[#Infallible Demon Judge]])
Once per scene, the Infernal may strengthen a supporting Intimacy by one step before rolling, or form a supporting Intimacy at Minor intensity. Doing so makes the automatic successes added by that Intimacy a non-Charm bonus.
