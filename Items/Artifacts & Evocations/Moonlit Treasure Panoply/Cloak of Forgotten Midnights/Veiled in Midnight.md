The cloak’s starry darkness spills out into its surroundings, plunging all into darkness.
The cloak’s darkness extends out to medium range from the wearer, following her as she moves. It inflicts a −3 penalty on her enemy’s vision-based rolls, but not hers or her allies. Mundane light sources can’t illuminate the darkness, while anima banners and other supernatural light can’t reduce the penalty below (the wearer’s Essence/2, rounded up).
While using this Evocation, spirits or fae related to darkness, night, or the moon count as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of reverence toward the Lunar.
## Resonant
Supernatural light sources can’t illuminate the darkness.

## Special activation rules
This Charm can be flurried with a [[Shape Sorcery]] action.
