*The Abyssal’s unwavering focus casts aside the frailty of mortal limitation.*
This Charm upgrades [[Superior (Sense) Focus]], and must be purchased separately for each set of senses.
While using [[Superior (Sense) Focus]] to enhance the chosen set of senses, the deathknight gains addition benefits:
 - The range at which she can make out fine sensory detail is further extended: one mile for vision or hearing, or (Essence/2, rounded up) miles for scent.
 - Instead of reducing sensory penalties by one, she halves them, rounded down.
 - When she makes a ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll using an enhanced sense, she reduces the cost of any instant-duration [[Awareness]] [[Charms]] she uses to enhance it by one mote each. If all five of her senses currently benefit from this Charm, she gains this discount on all [[Awareness]] rolls, including [[Join Battle]].
 - While using [[Awful Clarity Insight]], she rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on [[Awareness]] rolls using the enhanced sense.
