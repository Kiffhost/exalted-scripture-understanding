Moonlit Huntress was crafted in a potent Eastern demesne in the days when Creation was still untamed, shaped by the steady claw of the Lunar artisan Meheret. Burning ritually cultivated wood from the demesne, she heated and shaped the moonsilver by night, and hid it by day. Each night of its construction, she quenched it in the blood of a mighty beast hunted just for its making. After carrying it for some centuries, she later made of it a wedding gift to her Solar wife, who shared Meheretâ€™s passion for the hunt. The bow passed back into Lunar hands after the Usurpation. Its last owner, Fangs-of-Ivory, was slain by the Wyld Hunt three years ago. Moonlit Huntress still sleeps where the Lunar hid it, awaiting the arrival of a new Lunar or Solar master. Magic binds it into a clear stream somewhere in the East. It can only be seen at night during a full moon when the thaw is a month past and the stream is no longer rushing but no longer still, when the moonlight bends on the water in the rock bed where the bow rests. Then the curve of a bow sleeping beneath the surface may be seen, and Moonlit Huntress claimed. Moonlit Huntress is a gracefully recurved bow decorated with carved lunar phases along its arms. The two new moons of this design are hearthstone sockets. 

## Evocations of Moonlit Huntress 

A Solar or Lunar attuned to Moonlit Huntress gains a blessing from the weapon, which fluidly shifts depending on her standing in the ebb and flow of battle: 
- No Moon (0 or fewer Initiative): +1 non-Charm success to Stealth rolls. 
- Waning Moon (1-4 Initiative): +1 non-Charm success to disengage actions. 
- Half Moon (5-9 Initiative): +2 non-Charm successes to Awareness rolls. 
- Waxing Moon (10-14 Initiative): +3 automatic successes to rush and disengage actions. 
- Full Moon (15+ Initiative): The character may aim reflexively from up to long range for a decisive attack. Doing so grants no aiming bonus.
