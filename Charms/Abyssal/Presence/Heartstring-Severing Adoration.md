*The Abyssal’s terrible beauty eclipses all others, poisoning those who yearn for her.*
The Abyssal makes an instill roll against a single target to create or strengthen a Tie of romantic or sexual desire towards herself. If successful, her target suffers the following effects for this Charm’s duration
- The instilled Intimacy counts as one level higher against the Abyssal’s influence rolls if it’s advantageous for her. If the Tie is already Defining, her influence costs an additional Willpower for him to resist.
- Against influence that leverages the instilled Intimacy, he must weaken another of his positive Ties to resist with Willpower, if he has any.
Ties based on romantic or sexual desire must be weakened first.
- If he voluntarily weakens a positive Tie, it can’t be strengthened by any means unless he pays two Willpower per level of intensity.
- Once per day, when he voluntarily weakens another positive Tie in the Abyssal’s presence, she gains one Willpower.
With an Essence 5 repurchase, the Abyssal may target multiple characters with this roll, paying a three-mote surcharge for each additional target.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used against a character once per story.
