*The Infernal swallows her voice, consuming that which is most antithetical to blessed quiet so that she might speak in silence.*

The Infernal can communicate telepathically with other characters within long range, but can only do so in Old Realm. She can direct her mental messages either to a single character, or to all characters within this Charm’s range. They can’t respond to the Infernal’s message. Those familiar with the Infernal recognize the mental voice as hers.

The Infernal is incapable of speech or any other utterances while using this Charm, except for laughter.
## [[Keys]]
#### Every Tongue Severed (Linguistics 4)
This Charm and its [[Keys]] are no longer restricted to Old Realm. The Infernal adds two dice on telepathic influence rolls made in Old Realm.
#### Distant Whisper Wind (Linguistics 4, Essence 2) (3m)
The Infernal can pay three motes to extend this Charm’s range to (Essence x10) miles for a brief message or influence roll to a single recipient, or one band of extreme range beyond long range when addressing all characters in range.
#### Voice-Swallowing Kiss (Linguistics 5, Essence 3, [[#Every Tongue Severed (Linguistics 4)|Every Tongue Severed]])
The Infernal can use this Charm on other characters, requiring her to touch or kiss them. If her target is unwilling, she must also make a special (Charisma + Linguistics) influence roll against him. Intimacies don’t modify his Resolve against this. He can spend one Willpower to resist for a scene, breaking free once he’s done so (Infernal’s Essence) times. The Infernal can stack this Charm to affect multiple characters.
