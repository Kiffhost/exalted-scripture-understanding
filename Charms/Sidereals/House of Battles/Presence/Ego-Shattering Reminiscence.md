The Sidereal exhales wisps of crimson stardust heavy with her memories, sharing her past with those caught in their light. Focusing on a memory, the Sidereal makes a special (Charisma + Presence) instill roll, ignoring multiple target penalties and the need for a shared language. Affected characters have the memory implanted in their minds, remembering it as if they’d lived it themselves. The chosen memory can’t be more than a scene long. If the embedded memory is drastically inappropriate for a character’s life experiences, he suffers a −3 penalty on social and mental actions: giving a memory of berserk violence to a pacifist, or of life in Yu-Shan to a peasant. A character who uncovers evidence of a discrepancy in his memory may pay three Willpower to resist this Charm. 

## Special activation rules

If the chosen memory relates to an Intimacy, the Sidereal can reflexively use Impose Nature, conveying its effect through this Charm’s roll.
