*The Abyssal’s steed surges forward as if pursued by all the horrors of the Underworld.*
The deathknight gains the following benefits for one hour
- She adds (higher of Essence or 3) successes on mounted movement rolls.
- When she succeeds on a mounted rush, she gains two Initiative. If her mount is rolled into combat, it also gains two Initiative.
- Outside of combat, her mount can carry her at incredible speed: she can cover a distance that would normally take an hour to cross in ten minutes, a distance that would take a day to cross in a handful of hours, or a distance that would take a week to cross in a day.
This Charm’s cost is reduced to two motes, one Willpower while Ridden to the Bone is active. If the Abyssal reactivates this Charm when its effect runs out, she waives its Willpower cost.
