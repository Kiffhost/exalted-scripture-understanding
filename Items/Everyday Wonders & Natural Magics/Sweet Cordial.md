Syrupy and cloyingly sweet, this purple elixir is made from the glands of deep-sea fish from the far West, tubers from the Imperial Mountain, and orchids from jungles north of the Dreaming Sea. It is a powerful narcotic, leaving a character who consumes it in a drugged haze for half a day, but it is also a puissant remedy for physical harm. The recipient makes a difficulty 1 ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll, and if she is treated by a physician, he also rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) at difficulty 1. As long as one roll succeeds, the patient is healed of any infected wounds (Exalted, p. 235). If at least one roll nets 3+ successes, the patient heals one level of lethal or bashing damage. 

Sweet cordial remains in the patient’s system for a full month. Taken again during that time, it becomes toxic. Instead of healing, the patient spends half a day tormented by maddening hallucinations, and must succeed on a difficulty 6 ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) roll or suffer one die of lethal damage for each success she failed by, ignoring hardness.
