The Sidereal twists strands of fate into a cord, bringing strangers together as harmonious communities. The Sidereal sets events in motion that will lead to the formation of a new group or organization. She determines the group’s nature and its initial agenda but has no control over who joins it unless she intervenes directly; otherwise, coincidence and serendipity determine the group’s membership as like-minded people meet, discover shared interests, and form connections. This is a major project that takes a few days to complete, using a Craft related or associated with the group: Weaponsmithing for a mercenary company, Cooking for teahouse employees, Masonry for a mountain-god’s cult, etc. Once the project is complete, the Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Craft); the group forms with membership equivalent to one dot of Size (Exalted, p. 206) for each success. The Storyteller may impose a limit on the group’s maximum size if the surrounding community isn’t large enough to sustain a huge organization. Alternatively, the Sidereal can choose to bring together a group of people who share some trait — hair color, ethnicity, taste in fashion — without dictating the nature or agenda of the group they form, a technique known as the Singular Plumage Riot. The Storyteller chooses an agenda that will be beneficial to the Sidereal. Those brought together to form the group gain a Minor Tie of belonging toward it and a Minor Principle reflecting its agenda. With Singular Plumage Riot, these Intimacies are Major instead. This doesn’t apply to characters who subsequently join the group. Once per story, when the Sidereal interacts with the official affairs of a Fortuitous Fellowship or the personal affairs of a group member, she rolls (Charisma + Craft), gaining gold points equal to her successes.
