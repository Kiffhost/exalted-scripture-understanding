The stylist’s blow echoes through the future, striking at multiple points along her enemy’s progression through time. The stylist makes a withering or decisive attack against an enemy. If it hits, the attack is repeated at the end of the round as a surprise attack, inflicting a −2 Defense penalty. It benefits from all magic used to enhance the original attack, but the stylist can’t use additional effects to benefit it. Decisive attacks have the same base damage as the initial attack and don’t reset the stylist’s Initiative. She doesn’t need to still be within range of the enemy when the attack recurs. Reset: This Charm can only be used once per scene unless reset by landing a decisive attack at 12+ Initiative against a crashed enemy.
