Embodying predator and prey, the Lunar impossibly moves away and toward her foe simultaneously, both evading and intercepting. She adds [[Defense|Evasion]] to her [[Defense|Parry]], or vice versa. She can enhance her [[Defense]] with [[Charms]] that only apply when she uses that form of defense — e.g., if she added [[Defense|Parry]] to [[Defense|Evasion]], she could enhance it with [[Heron Sheds Rain]]. She can’t add [[Defense|Evasion]] against undodgeable attacks, or [[Defense|Parry]] against unblockable attacks. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by successfully defending against three decisive attacks from nontrivial enemies.
