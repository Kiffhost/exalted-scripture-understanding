When the Lunar uses Shining Moon-Child Mark, she may enhance it with one or more of the following: Enduring Argent Blazon: The mark can’t be removed except by efforts enhanced by magic. This doesn’t apply to marks that are objects. Geas-Brand Affliction: The Lunar specifies a task or condition. If the marked character satisfies it, this Charm ends. Saga-Scribing Rune: The Lunar imbues the mark with information related to her Tie, such as how she expects her herald to be treated or the crimes committed by a marked enemy. Those who see the mark intuitively discern this information. Watchful Shepherd’s Sign: The mark’s meaning can only be recognized by members of a culture or cultures designated by the Lunar.
