Sometimes, a player will attempt to simply sway a mass of people with social influence, rather than appealing to any one character or specific group. While a player character or significant NPC should always be allowed to resist influence with her [[Resolve]], if all the characters in the audience are effectively minor, unimportant characters who would not normally be given their own mechanical definition, the Storyteller can simply treat the entire audience as a single entity with a single [[Resolve]] rating. 

Most mortal audiences will have a [[Resolve]] of 1 or 2, while audiences of exceptional mental resilience, such as ascetic monks or spiritually powerful beings, may have a [[Resolve]] of 3 or 5 (though there are few cases when it would be appropriate to lump magical creatures into an audience) The Storyteller can assign [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] to the audience based on the general feelings of the crowd—an audience composed of Gem citizens is likely to have a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of patriotism towards Gem, for example. 

Generally, when the rules for targeting an audience are brought into play, the Storyteller shouldn’t bother with the rules for rejecting influence with [[Willpower]], but instead define what percentage of the audience is convinced, usually based on how it aligns with their [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. This might range from the entire crowd, if the influence aligns with a Defining [[Intimacy]], to only a sizable minority, if it opposes a Defining [[Intimacy]]. 

Any character who has her own individual traits always resists social influence using her own [[Resolve]] and [[Willpower]], even if she’s a member of an audience being targeted by such an action. In the case of magic that specifically targets an audience, such characters are treated as separate targets, rather than automatically following the actions of the crowd
