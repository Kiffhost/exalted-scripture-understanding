Grows-in-the-Telling Technique The Lunar’s eyes burn with devilish intensity as she scours her presence from a witness’ memory. At a scene’s end, she makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [Presence or Socialize]) instill roll against one character. Success suppresses his memories of the scene, without a chance to resist with [[Willpower]]. He forgets everything that happened during that scene, and believes no time has passed since the scene’s beginning. If a character failed an influence roll targeting solely the Lunar’s victim during the erased scene, that action resets. Conversely, if a character succeeded on a persuade, bargain, or threaten roll against the target, that influence is terminated along with his memory of it. If the player of the influencing character doesn’t consent to this, the Lunar’s instill roll is subject to the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221), and fails entirely if she can’t overturn the opposing influence. Instilled Intimacies and inspired emotions remain, though the victim doesn’t realize they’re the result of another’s influence. If someone reminds the victim of the scene’s events, or he finds evidence that time has passed without his awareness, he may resist this influence for three [[Willpower]], regaining his memories. Terminated influence resumes, while reset actions must be reset again, if characters haven’t already attempted them. This Charm can only be used once per day. Once the Lunar uses this Charm against a character, he’s immune to further uses for (his [[Integrity]]) days.
