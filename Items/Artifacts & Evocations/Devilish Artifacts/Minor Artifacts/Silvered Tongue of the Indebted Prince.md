The merchant prince Ofrid Pineborne was as notorious for his negotiation skills as for his gambling. When his debts grew beyond bearing, Makarios, the Sigil’s Dreamer, visited Ofrid’s dreams to strike a deal, hoping to expand his own market in Creation. Ofrid was all too happy to find mortal dreamers for his demonic visitor, but the demon demanded more, requiring the merchant prince’s silver tongue as collateral. Ofrid happily accepted, having already wagered his head (tongue included) on a business venture. In time, Makarios discovered their deal had been struck on false pretenses, and made certain that Ofrid surrendered much, much more.

Ofrid’s tongue, now coated in silver, serves as the centerpiece of an ornate amulet. When attuned for three motes, the bearer becomes fluent in spoken Rivertongue, Guild Cant, and Old Realm, though not their written forms. She triples 10 on rolls to bargain, gamble, or cheat at games, 1 but any 1s that she rolls subtract successes. Using magic that rerolls 1s deprives her of the amulet’s benefits on a roll.
