That’s not a typo. This is a Reflexive Charm with no cost. Surprise Anticipation Method represents a Solar who has honed her senses to a near psychic degree. They act on her behalf to reveal threats to her. Remember, though, Charms are not actors—it is simply easier to communicate the idea to the player in terms of what a Charm does. In reality, Charms only represent the naturally enhanced proclivities of the character in question, pre-existing, validated by the player’s investment of experience points.
