*Having retired from soldiering, Ophione grew old and blind with her kin, but her alertness never dimmed.*
When her village sheltered a band of travelers overnight, she sensed a wrongness about them. When the bandits threw off their disguises to strike by night, she Exalted fighting them off.
Though Ophione loved her people, a small village offered little scope for her renewed vitality and heroic passions. While wandering Creation, Ophione encountered the Dragon-Blooded prince Anandra of Brass; she deemed him honorable and well-intentioned, and eventually sought a commission among his captains. Anandra had [[Eyebright]] forged so that Ophione need not go without sight in his service. She was his strong right hand on the battlefield and in his Dreaming Sea court, but Anandra’s lifespan proved shorter than hers. Though she was his logical heir, she had no interest in ruling or generalship, and left to wander Creation once again. After Ophione perished in the fateful duel where she slew her overambitious Solar mate, the formidable East Wind Prince, [[Eyebright]] vanished from history for centuries, reappearing after the Usurpation in Thousand-Swords Oravan’s armory. Since his Silver Principiate’s fall, the hauberk has passed between many Lunars; it currently resides in the treasure vaults of the Three Devil Princes of the Southwest, who await a worthy bearer. 

A coat of glittering moonsilver scales reinforced with pauldrons and vambraces, Eyebright’s most noteworthy features are its star sapphires. Seventy-seven in number, large as robin’s eggs, the gems sparkle all across its surface. Each serves as an eye, its chatoyant star shifting to follow its wearer’s attention.

## [[Evocations]] of [[Eyebright]] 

Eyebright’s wearer can see in all directions, adding one success on sight-based rolls opposing [[Stealth]]. She ignores penalties from visual impairment to her own eyes, such as blindness, but not from impairment that also affects the armor’s eyes, such as darkness or fog. 

Eyebright’s [[Evocations]] rely on the wearer’s understanding of her opponents, measured by *Insight*. Her Insight into each opponent equals the highest value of any of that character’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] relevant to the fight of which she’s aware, e.g., [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that sparked the confrontation or those that influence the opponent’s tactics and priorities during the fight.
