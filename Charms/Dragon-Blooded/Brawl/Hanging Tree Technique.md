Arms and legs twist as the Dragon-Blood throws her entire body into an attack, lunging with each of her limbs to grapple and pin down foes. She makes a grapple gambit against up to (Dexterity) enemies in close range, clinching one or even two foes at a time with each of her limbs. She makes only one attack roll and Initiative roll against all enemies, but rolls (Strength + Brawl) separately to establish control against each enemy. On each turn of the clinch, she may either restrain all foes, expending two rounds of control over each of them; make a withering or decisive savaging attack against all foes; or release all foes. Withering savaging attacks use a single attack roll, but roll damage separately against each grappled foe. Only the single highest withering damage roll awards Initiative to the Dragon-Blood, although she can receive Initiative Breaks for crashing multiple foes. Decisive savaging attacks divide her Initiative evenly among all foes (rounded up) to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring Hardness.
