*Wearer and wings move in harmony.*
This Evocation permanently upgrades its prerequisite, removing the −3 precision penalty from the [[Wings]] merit. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder, who must have been attuned for at least one story and is aerially engaged with a dangerous foe, defeats that foe or emerges from [[Initiative]] Crash.
