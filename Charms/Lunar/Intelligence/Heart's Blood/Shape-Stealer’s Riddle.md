Outwitting a worthy foe in a duel of minds, the Lunar claims his shape as proof of her superior intellect.
The Lunar performs a sacred hunt to claim a human’s shape by challenging him to an intellectual contest, battle of wits, or the like — philosophical debate, games of riddles, racing to solve a puzzle, making legal arguments to a judge, etc. This can often be resolved with an opposed (Intelligence + Lore) roll.
If the Lunar wins, she may conclude the sacred hunt and claim her opponent’s form by accepting a Major Tie of respect toward the opponent — if she deems him unworthy, she can’t gain his form. This counts as the Intimacy needed to take a human shape. Winning by cheating is valid if the Lunar isn’t caught, but her opponent must be genuinely trying to win.
If the Lunar’s target wins or catches her cheating, the sacred hunt fails, and she can’t take his shape through this Charm for the rest of the story. She may still attempt sacred hunts against him by other means.
