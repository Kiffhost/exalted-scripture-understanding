*The Infernal burns immortals to ash, searing a victim’s shadow into the ground. All that remains of him are horrific visions of his death that haunt the dreams of those who sleep nearby.*

The Infernal’s decisive attack deals aggravated damage to spirits. Each 10 on the damage roll sets the spirit’s very Essence ablaze, causing it to lose one mote and rolling an additional die of decisive damage. A spirit incapacitated by this attack is permanently destroyed.

This Charm’s cost is reduced by one mote against demons. [[Wayward Divinity Oversight]] can extend this discount to other kinds of spirits.
