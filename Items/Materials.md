# Special [[Materials]]

Various unusual materials can be found all across Creation. Armaments made from these usually cost one dot of resources more than normal, and this cost can increase to two dots in regions far from where they’re normally found. 
## Chiaroscuro Glass

In portions of the South, especially near the city of Chiaroscuro, armorers make weapons and armor from crimson shards of the city’s almost indestructible First Age glass. Unlike metal armaments, which rust, chip and require regular polishing and oiling, weapons and armor made from Chiaroscuro glass require almost no care because the glass is so durable. 

## Feathersteel

In portions of the far North, especially in the Haslanti League, miners find veins of feathersteel in the ice-covered mountains. Feathersteel is a light metal that also has the virtue of not rusting. Feathersteel armaments never rust and are somewhat lighter than normal. All armor made from feathersteel gains the [[Item Tags#Silent|silent]] tag (p. 593). 
## Ironwood

In portions of the forests of the East, especially near the regions ruled by the Republic of Halta, woodworkers know the secret of making wood as hard as steel. Ironwood arms and armor require as much care as similar metal equipment, but are made from wood. Ironwood armor gains the [[Item Tags#Buoyant|buoyant]] tag (p. 593). Unlike other special materials, in the region where they’re made, ironwood armaments cost no more than normal. Elsewhere, they costs one resource dot more.

# The Five Magical [[Materials]]

The five magical materials are the most mystically potent substances known to the craftsmen and savants of Creation, and they almost universally form the basis for artifact creation. The dominant magical material used in an artifact has an enormous impact not only on its character, but on who most strongly covets the item—for while the [[Solar Exalted]] are equally adept with all magical materials, other varieties of Exalted have powerful affinities for a particular magical material, and limited aptitude in establishing a bond with artifacts not of that substance.

It’s also not unheard-of for an artifact to be forged of an alloy of different magical materials, or to incorporate multiple magical materials into different parts of its substance. Such nuanced artifacts are highly valued by some Exalted, as those with perfect blends lent new, hybrid strength to the Solars, while those that incorporated small amounts of an additional magical material to support or shade the power of a dominant material were greatly valued by their fellow Chosen.

That said, an artifact’s dominant magical material is a heavy influence on its [[Evocations]], but not the only influence—the guidelines below can be modified by the artifact’s construction, history, and the rapport it establishes with its wielder. They’re a starting point, not a set of hard constraints.

## Jade

Jade is the most common of the magical materials, found in quarries and deposits all across Creation. It resonates with the Dragon-Blooded, and is used not only to forge their artifacts, but as the true currency of the Realm. Jade is the most diverse magical material, appearing in five varieties—while all Dragon-Blooded are equally adept with any variety of jade, most prefer to adorn themselves with jade matching their inborn Aspect. All varieties of jade are adept at manifesting and channeling their associated element, but beyond that commonality, the [[Evocations]] of jade differ significantly. These secondary qualities, combined with its availability, make jade the most common magical material used in composite artifacts.

#### Black Jade 
Black jade resonates with the element of water. Its [[Evocations]] grant control over water, flexibility, the ability to communicate with or beckon spirits, the power to flood things or draw the moisture from them, and occasionally the manifestation of destructive liquids such as acid or boiling water. 
#### Blue Jade 
Blue jade resonates with the element of air. It can be used to stir the air, create blasts of wind, lower the temperature or create ice, harness or manifest lightning, or anticipate the intent of opponents or even briefly glimpse their thoughts. 
#### Green Jade 
Green jade resonates with the element of wood. Its [[Evocations]] control plants, make things grow or wither, produce manifestations of wood, establish rapport with the natural world, siphon [[Essence]] from living things or transfer it into them, and manifest toxins. 
#### Red Jade 
Red Jade resonates with the element of fire. Its [[Evocations]] frequently control, manifest, or grant protection from flames. They also heighten reflexes, raise temperatures, grant a controlled battle-fury, quicken movements, and grant explosive power to attacks and evasions. 
#### White Jade 
White jade resonates with the element of earth. It grants control over or allows manifestation of earth, sand, dirt, and stone, hardens things, immobilizes, strikes with enormous force, grants calm and mental clarity, and mesmerizes opponents.

### Arms of the Chosen

More common than any other magical material — though still far scarcer than mundane silver — jade appears throughout the lands of Creation. Unlike the others, jade is stone rather than metal, though powdered jade is usually alloyed with steel to craft weapons and armor. It’s smooth and glossy in either state, its colors rich and brilliant. The Realm covets jade, using it both for currency and for almost all of its artifacts, and the Empress dedicated much of her foreign policy to controlling Threshold jade mines. With her disappearance, the Great Houses and other Dynastic factions squabble to control this rare, precious resource. 

Like the Dragon-Blooded who resonate with its elemental nature, jade comes in five hues. As stone, it comes in endless patterns and gradations of subtle shades, though jade-steel alloy loses those natural variations. Each of jade’s colors has its own characteristics, rooted in affinity for one of the five elements. This includes both direct elemental manifestations and more metaphorical expressions.

**Black jade** glitters black as the sea at midnight, though some is shot through with shadowy swirls and whorls. It’s most often found near rivers, along coastlines, and on the ocean floor. Its powers draw on the [[Essence]] of water — the subtle fluid motion of currents, the ebb and flow of tides, and the irresistible pull of the deeps. Its affinities include aquatic life, resilience, fluidity, elusiveness, deception, illusion, mystery, intuition, emotion, indirect forces, change, adaptation, corrosion, acid, dissolution, and spirits.

**Blue jade** glows blue as a cloudless sky, whether the pale azure of winter dawn or a summer evening’s rich cerulean. It feels lighter than other jades, and is cool to the touch. Veins appear atop snow-capped mountains and throughout the frozen North. Its magic is tied to air and winter, and its affinities include wind, cold, ice, precipitation, lightning, flying creatures, swiftness, precision, intellect, understanding, memory, language, philosophy, music, and silence

**Green jade** appears in all the vibrant hues of fresh vegetation, sometimes mottled brown. Even when worked, it looks more grown than carved. It can be found within forest-cloaked hills, beneath the jungle soil, or caught in the roots of ancient trees. Its [[Evocations]] tap the [[Essence]] of life, giving it an affinity for plants, animals, wilderness, fertility, growth, vitality, interconnection, pleasure, nourishment, healing, narcotics, and poisons.

**Red jade** blazes scarlet, often shot through with fiery orange and yellow veins, occasionally streaked with smoky gray. Its colors shift as it catches the light; it feels warm to the touch. It’s found in places that have known great heat — volcanic islands, lava tubes, or under burning desert sands. It has affinities for flame, smoke, heat, light, illumination, revelation, warmth, passion, zeal, unpredictability, flickering movement, violence, destruction, purification, and renewal.

**White jade** feels heavier and denser than other jades. Most often ivory-hued, it can be white as mutton fat, while Underworld veins tend to be ashen gray. Found inside mountains and deep within Creation’s bedrock, it’s associated with the roots of the earth: solid as a mountain, stable as a foundation, unstoppable as a landslide. White jade artifacts have affinities for earth, stone, solidity, stability, harmony, strength, momentum, gravity, resistance, inertia, magnetism, stubbornness, tradition, history, passivity, and sleep.
## Moonsilver

Moonsilver is a silvery metal, harder than steel in its unworked state, with a liquid, quicksilver sheen when viewed in dim light. It resonates with the [[Lunar Exalted]], and in the past, Luna’s Chosen felt that for any non-Lunar to carry moonsilver arms and armor burdened them with proving themselves worthy of the substance—it was common for Lunars to challenge the bearers of moonsilver to contests and competitions. In the modern day, the Lunars are prone to simply stealing or seizing any moonsilver artifacts they become aware of, making such wonders dangerous to own. 

Moonsilver’s [[Essence]] is protean and wild. Its [[Evocations]] often unite wielder and weapon in a bridge of primal instinct or mystical insight. Its attacks are often either flamboyant and barely-restrained, or else subtle and insidious, laced with poisons, slivers of heart-seeking metal, or ever-bleeding wounds. Some moonsilver [[Evocations]] produce physical manifestations in the weapon—while it’s unusual for a moonsilver artifact to flow and reshape itself like water or clay, a longfang might flex to strike around interposing blades, a daiklave might stretch to drive its point deeper into vital organs, and a grimcleaver might release its mighty ax-head to fly into the Lunar’s foes like a moth, only to draw it back in the next moment.

### Arms of the Chosen

Moonsilver is harder than steel, never tarnishes, and exhibits a special brilliance in moonlight. Though it’s the color of ordinary silver, it reflects light in ripples like troubled water, and its surface slowly shifts and pulses as if alive. Moonsilver has an affinity for the [[Lunar Exalted]].

The metal is most often found at world’s edge, on the borders of chaos. Its ores manifest in liminal places where land meets water, such as riverbanks, lake shores, sea-caves, mountainous islands, or benthic chasms. Lodes of moonsilver have grown rarer of late; the Realm has sealed off many sources, while others have simply vanished.

Moonsilver hosts a feral magic. Some moonsilver artifacts bristle with barely-restrained fury. Others are cool and subtle, their [[Evocations]] lurking like serpents. Like ever-changing Luna herself, the metal is associated with transformation and inconstancy: shapeshifting, malleability, cyclic change, reflection, opposition, duality, purification, emotion, creativity, secrecy, insight, intuition, dreams, madness, and otherworldly realms. Like Luna’s Chosen, it also has affinities for beasts, predation, pair bonds, adaptation, strength, deftness, vitality, trickery, and witchcraft. These effects are often internal to the artifact or its wielder.

Some moonsilver artifacts can modify their own shape or substance — normally an unobtrusive process, but occasionally a spectacular one. The metal’s sorcerous applications lean toward internal power and transformations, as well as transmogrification of others.

## Orichalcum

Orichalcum is a super-hard, bright, golden metal to which only the [[Solar Exalted]] feel a natural affinity. Although they can wield all of the magical materials with equal facility, the Solars much valued orichalcum, for it resonated with their own [[Charms]] far more strongly than any other substance. Orichalcum can sometimes be found in naturally-occurring veins, often on mountains, plateaus, and other elevated locales. In the First Age, a process was known that could refine gold into orichalcum by using lava and mystical mirrors to concentrate the light of the sun, but those refineries were destroyed or abandoned during the Usurpation and the centuries of collapse that followed. 

Orichalcum’s properties lead to diverse and powerful [[Evocations]]. The substance is a natural amplifier for power, and was frequently used for this purpose in mixed-material artifacts. It is the best magical material for empowering [[sorcery]]. Orichalcum has great potential for harnessing the power of light while taming shadows, channeling divine judgment to burn away that which is tainted or unclean, and channeling elemental power into stored energy, then unleashing it as omni-elemental or non-elemental force. Powerful orichalcum artifacts can harness celestial and terrestrial phenomena, provoking earthquakes, calling down shooting stars, or raising a tempest. Orichalcum can unleash cutting or smashing [[Essence]]-pressure like no other substance, and can take on the qualities of other magic; it was often called “wishmetal” by those who worked with it, for its diverse applications. 

When the Solars were murdered, they were buried in lavish tombs to appease their powerful ghosts, and most of their orichalcum panoplies were sealed away with them as grave goods. Solars reborn in the Age of Sorrows sometimes dream of these tombs’ locations, and the wonders hidden within.

### Arms of the Chosen

This warm, brilliant metal is as invulnerable and puissant as the Unconquered Sun himself. It gleams at all times as though sunlight shone upon it, its color richer and more vibrant than gold. Its nature resonates with that of the [[Solar Exalted]], for whom its use seems natural as breathing. Veins of orichalcum ore appear close to the sun, beneath mountain peaks and alpine plateaus. Ancient savants knew methods to distill gold into orichalcum using lava and sun-focusing magic mirrors, but the relevant tools and techniques are lost. 

Orichalcum partakes most purely of potencies mythically associated with the sun: raw power, unshakable strength, excellence, light and shadow, revelation, healing, divine judgment, purity, majesty, and glory. Orichalcum channels [[Essence]] and sorcerous energies better than any other magical material. While lacking jade’s pure elemental character, it can harness forceful, vibrant, or energetic natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions, and can channel, absorb, and redirect elemental forces. Most orichalcum artifacts are straightforward, direct, and unsubtle. Like the sun, they claim the center of attention.

Pre–First Age orichalcum artifacts often exhibit a greenish patina, a consequence of channeling overwhelming amounts of baleful sorcerous [[Essence]]. Between this and its long association with the Solar Anathema, some Dragon-Blooded call orichalcum “demon-gold” and reject it as tainted with infernal power. Dynastic military forces aligned with the Wyld Hunt guard known orichalcum lodes, anticipating that returning Solars will try to gain access to their favored metal.

## Starmetal

Starmetal, once refined and worked, is the least ostentatious of the magical materials—it looks like top-quality steel, with an unusually reflective and polished surface. When light strikes starmetal just so, it gleams in the prismatic colors of the Five Maidens. Starmetal is the rarest magical material, refined from the ore found in fallen stars. The [[Sidereal Exalted]] find starmetal alone resonates with their [[Essence]], and use their astrology and [[sorcery]] to predict and chart the course of falling stars, then venture out into Creation to recover the meteoric ore. Due to its extreme rarity, most starmetal artifacts sport delicate and minimalist designs, and when starmetal appears in composite artifacts, it is usually in the form of wire filigree or etched designs rather than amalgamated alloy.

Starmetal [[Evocations]] are adept at binding spirits and exuding god-miracles, at revealing hidden truths or unraveling intricate tactics, at striking at or harnessing ephemeral concepts, at translating one kind of power into another, and at deferring unacceptable fates by substituting some lesser loss—starmetal armor might protect its wearer from a certain killing blow by instead diverting the attack to slay a cherished memory or bond of love, for example. Certain starmetal artifacts also harbor [[Evocations]] that duplicate spirit [[Charms]].

### Arms of the Chosen

Where other magical materials originate beneath the earth, starmetal comes from the sky. Creation’s anima — formed of [[Essence]] expenditure by terrestrial and celestial gods — gathers among the constellations like fishes in a net. Masses of this gathered power fall from the heavens as meteors. Meteoric ore appears identical to ordinary iron, and is refined using the same techniques. Purified starmetal resembles polished steel, albeit harder and lighter, and it flashes with the Five Maidens’ colors when it catches the light.

No other magical material is scarce as starmetal — meteors fall but rarely, and their size cannot compare to veins of subterranean ore. The Sidereals claim most of it, their astrology leading them unerringly to freshly fallen meteorites. Artificers use it sparingly, forging it into slim unadorned designs, or applying it as inlay or filigree to artifacts of other magical materials.

Gathering as it does among the constellations, starmetal has an affinity for the thrumming threads of the Loom of Fate, and for the magic of the [[Sidereal Exalted]]. Starmetal is associated with fate, destiny, luck, time, knowledge, foresight, mysteries, esoteric forces, and ephemeral things. Some meteors retain qualities of the constellations they fell from, or the astrological Houses of Journeys, Serenity, Battles, Secrets, or Endings.

Coming as it does from the heavens, starmetal holds influence over gods and other spirits. Some starmetal artifacts possess [[Evocations]] that replicate spirit [[Charms]].

## Soulsteel

Soulsteel is a gruesome magical material, appearing at first glance like black steel. When light strikes it, however, tortured faces can sometimes be glimpsed deep in the metal, and under extended scrutiny, they can be seen (and in the heat of battle, occasionally heard) to writhe and scream. Alone among the magical materials, soulsteel cannot be found in naturally-occurring deposits in Creation, but is instead made in the soul-forges of the Deathlords, pounded together from rare Underworld ores and the souls of those who have angered the lords of the realm of tears and dust. The Abyssal Exalted find that soulsteel resonates with their nature, and are rarely seen in Creation without it. Soulsteel artifacts dating back to the First Age are exceedingly rare, but not unknown.

Soulsteel [[Evocations]] excel at binding and harnessing the powers of violence and death. They summon or bind ghosts, call up the dark power of the Underworld, cause injuries to fester, animate dead flesh, transform the wielder’s injuries into a source of power, amplify pain, hold death at bay so their master can fight on, and drain the vital energies of those they harm.

### Arms of the Chosen

Soulsteel is the only magical material that doesn’t naturally appear in Creation. It’s occasionally found in the Underworld’s depths, where many ghosts have fallen into oblivion, or where necrotic energies gather into demesnes. Writings from the First Age — when a handful of Chosen smiths made occasional use of the metal — mention primeval veins forming where the blood of dying enemies of the gods seeped into the earth. But most soulsteel is smelted in the soul-forges of the Underworld, alloying strange shadow-ores with souls of the tormented dead.

Though soulsteel resembles dark iron at first glance, further examination reveals its ghastly nature in the faces of horror-stricken ghosts writhing and wailing beneath its surface. Battle and ritual intensify their torment, calling forth terrible moans or screams.

The Abyssal Exalted possess an affinity with this macabre material, whose magic is linked with the negative influences of suffering, emptiness, and endings — blood, silence, cold, darkness, death, disease, weakness, violence, pain, fear, despair, rage, greed, and hatred. In addition, no other substance has such strong ties to the Underworld, commanding, banishing, binding, transforming, and slaying ghosts and other undead. Soulsteel can efficaciously channel sorcerous [[Essence]] towards destructive ends, and is an ideal focus for the necromancy of the Abyssal Exalted.

# Magical [[Materials]] and the Exalted

The extent to which an Exalt can draw out an artifact’s [[Evocations]] depends on the affinity between its magical material composition and her Exalted [[Essence]]. The differing degrees of power that can be roused are represented through two keywords: Dissonant and Resonant. The Dissonant keyword restricts or limits an Evocation’s power for an Exalt who doesn’t resonate with the artifact’s material. The Resonant keyword depicts the heights of power a wielder whose [[Essence]] fully resonates with the artifact’s material can evoke.

**The Solar Exalted**, masters of [[Evocations]], are resonant with all magical materials. 

**The Lunar Exalted** are resonant with moonsilver. Their affinity with the other magical materials is neutral. 

**The Sidereal Exalted** chase fallen stars for precious starmetal, the only magical material they’re resonant with. They’re dissonant with all other magical materials. 

**The Dragon-Blooded** are resonant with jade. They have neutral affinity with moonsilver, orichalcum, and starmetal, but are dissonant with soulsteel. 

**The Abyssal Exalted** have a dark affinity for soulsteel, resonating with it. Their affinity with other magical materials is neutral. 

**The Liminal Exalted** have a mysterious connection with soulsteel, but their affinity with it is only neutral, unable to fully resonate with it. They’re dissonant with all other magical materials. 

**The Getimian Exalted**, like the Sidereals, are resonant with starmetal and dissonant with all other materials.

**Exigents**, as always, are impossible to generalize. They can resonate with any magical material, or more than one, or none. Some rely solely on artifacts made from exotic materials. 

Other Exalted, as of yet unrevealed, have their own affinities for the magical materials. 

Gods, demons, fae, and other un-Exalted beings capable of attuning to artifacts normally don’t harmonize with any of the magical materials. Weaker entities are dissonant, while stronger beings — such as Second Circle Demons, nephwracks, or raksha nobles — have a neutral affinity. Many exceptions to this general rule are found in Creation, and the Storyteller always has final say on what level of power an un-Exalted character can evoke.
