*The Abyssal is an artist of dead flesh, transforming bone and viscera into undead masterpieces.*
The Abyssal spends an hour laboring over a human or human-like corpse with surgical tools, reanimating it as a zombie (Exalted, p. 502) with a Defining Tie of obedience towards her that can’t be weakened.
Alternatively, for a five-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge, the Abyssal can surgically enhance a zombie or other reanimated corpse, increasing the time needed to use this Charm to eight hours. This confers one of the following benefits:
 - +1 die to all [[Strength]]-based dice pools and raw withering damage. An undead can only receive this benefit once.
 - +1 die to all [[Dexterity]]-based dice pools. An undead can only receive this benefit once.
 - +1 die to all [[Stamina]]-based dice pools and +1 soak. An undead can only receive this benefit once.
 - A −4 health level. An undead can only receive this benefit (higher of Abyssal’s [[Essence]] or 3) times.
If the deathknight has dots in a [[Craft]] that involves the preparation or use of dead flesh, such as embalming, taxidermy, tanning, or cooking, she receives craft points for meeting objectives with this Charm as though she’d completed a major project (Exalted, p. 241).
