The Solar champion Vaznia took up dozens of artifacts across the ages, but few held her interest for long. Among those arms were Sirrush and Anshar, a pair of artifact flame pieces she commissioned to match a favored concubine’s eyes. She gifted them to her lieutenant Rylo Stormsong without ever wielding them in battle. A thrill-seeker, Rylo went looking for trouble in every teahouseanddarkalleyofOldWu-Jian.Thussheentangled herself in all manner of violent altercations, from battling armiesofthugssentbydouble-crossedcrimelordstostealing relics from hidden shrines to forbidden undersea gods. In extricating herself from such situations she employed hertwindevilcasterstodeadlyeffect.Eventuallyshefound herself outmatched, hunted by an affronted sorcerer’s seademons.LeapingfromthepinnacleoftheCrescentTemple into the sea-spray to escape pursuit, she never surfaced. Sirrush was found a thousand years later by Wu-Jian mudlarks. It worked its way up through the city’s teeming layers in cutthroat deals and throat-cut thefts, until one of the now-defunct Lords Criminal traded it to the outcaste pirate Storm Mother’s Son for a cargo of firedust. Sirrush’s counterpart Anshar remains lost.
