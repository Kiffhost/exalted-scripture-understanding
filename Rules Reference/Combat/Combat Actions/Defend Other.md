The character protects an ally within close range interposing himself to deflect attacks. The defending character may apply his [[Parry]] against any attacks directed at his ward until his next turn. Should an attack defeat the guardian’s Parry, the attacker may choose either to apply the attack to the guardian, or may attempt to strike his original target by using his [[Dice Rolls#Threshold Successes|threshold successes]] to attempt to overcome the original target’s [[Defense]]. If he chooses to strike his original target with a [[#decisive]] attack, the [[#damage roll]] suffers a [[Dice Rolls#Modifiers|penalty]] equal to the protecting character's [[Defense]]/2 (rounding up).
