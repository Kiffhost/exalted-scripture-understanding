TheDragon-Bloodâ€™sstrengthisinexorable,findingpoints of leverage like an ancient tree digging roots into stone. She adds a bonus success on a feat of strength, and may use her [[Stamina]] in place of her [[Strength]] rating to determine if she qualifies to attempt it. If she has [[Strength of Stone Technique]] active, she counts the dot of [[Strength]] it grants as a dot of [[Stamina]] for the purposes of the feat. In Wood Aura, the added success is a non-Charm bonus. An [[Athletics]] 5, [[Essence]] 4 repurchase lets the Dragon-Blood spend one [[Willpower]] to add her [[Stamina]] to her [[Strength]] to determine if she may attempt a feat, rather than substituting it.
