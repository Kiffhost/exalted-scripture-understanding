Her incandescent spirit magnifies the Lawgiver with aspects of glory and terror. While this Charm is active, characters must pay a point of temporary Willpower to speak against her or attack her. Her enemies need only pay this price once per scene. In addition, all threaten actions against her suffer a penalty equal to her Essence.
