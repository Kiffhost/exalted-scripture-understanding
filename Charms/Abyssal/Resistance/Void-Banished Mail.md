*The Abyssal’s armor bursts into countless wisps of foxfire, vanishing until she has need of it.*
The Abyssal banishes either or both of her armor or a shield Elsewhere. If she has both armor and shield, a single use affects both.
A second use of this Charm recalls the banished equipment. Recalled armor must be donned normally (Exalted, p. 591).
