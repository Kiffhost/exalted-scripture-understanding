*Buried beneath a stone cairn by the Sidereal, a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and the Road erupts with ten spines of indigo light that rise skyward, revealing a spirit in such desperate peril that he might accept the Earth-and-Sky Bargain.*
The Sidereal rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) to introduce the fact that there’s a god or elemental on the brink of permanent destruction nearby. Such spirits might be found in danger from monstrous horrors, supernatural diseases, exotic poisons, sorceries that compromise immortality, or Exalted capable of permanently slaying spirits.
The Sidereal can specify the general kind of spirit — “a fire elemental,” “a martial god,” etc. — but not an individual or a specific kind of spirit, like “a lion-dog.” She also chooses the spirit’s desired Essence rating, maximum 6. The roll’s difficulty is the chosen spirit’s (Essence + Willpower).
On a success, the Sidereal will find the spirit in time to offer her bargain. If she fails, a spirit of the Storyteller’s choice still appears, similar in nature to what the Sidereal’s player had specified but with a lower Essence commensurate to her roll’s successes. Alternatively, failure might reveal a spirit with the same Essence rating but a very different nature, as long as this doesn’t undercut the reason the Sidereal’s player used this Charm.
If the Sidereal tries to convince the spirit to accept her offer with a persuade roll, then doing so is only an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216). She can take other social approaches if she wishes, and may not even need to make an influence roll, depending on the circumstances she finds the spirit in.
If the spirit accepts the bargain, the Sidereal binds him to her soul. She gains the following benefits
- She gains his Cult rating.
- She can temporarily access his Eclipse Charms for three motes each, which she must commit upon using this Charm. She can learn them permanently for eight experience points each.
- She adds (his Essence) soak and gains Hardness (his Essence + Willpower).
- She gains half his total health track as temporary health levels, rounding up for each type of level (e.g., if the god has five −1 levels and three −2 levels, the Sidereal would gain three −1 levels and two −2 levels). These levels are the first of their type to be filled and vanish when damaged. The Sidereal regains a single lost temporary level after a full night’s sleep, starting with −4 levels and moving up.
- If the spirit is an air or wood elemental or a god associated with those elements, the Sidereal adds his Essence to the number of motes she recovers each hour.
The Sidereal can pay 15 motes and one Willpower to transfer the bound spirit to a touched character, conferring the above benefits on him. She must still maintain her mote commitment to this Charm. That character can’t transfer the spirit to others, nor can he return it to the Sidereal.
Once this Charm ends, the bound spirit reforms. Its nature often changes to reflect the personality and passions of its host, and spirits weaker than their host may become more powerful. If the Sidereal maintains this Charm for its full duration, the spirit is unlikely to feel any obligation to her, but if she cuts it short so the spirit may be reborn earlier, it may be willing to perform a serious or even a life-defining task for her without requiring a roll.
