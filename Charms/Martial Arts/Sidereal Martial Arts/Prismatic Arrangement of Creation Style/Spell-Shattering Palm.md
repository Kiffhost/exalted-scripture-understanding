*Delicate threads of spellcraft unravel as the stylist yanks and pulls at them.*
When a character the stylist can perceive casts a spell that targets her, she clashes the final Shape Sorcery roll with a decisive attack, rolling (Intelligence + {Lore or Occult}). If the caster gathered the final motes to cast the spell without a Shape Sorcery action or it was otherwise unrolled, he rolls (Intelligence + Occult) for the clash. Winning the clash negates the spell’s effect, including its effects on other characters. The stylist doesn’t make a damage roll or reset her Initiative.
If the stylist isn’t a sorcerer, or if she’s not initiated into the Circle of the spell she clashes, she must pay a surcharge of one Willpower per circle she falls short — e.g., a Terrestrial Circle sorcerer would need to pay a two-Willpower surcharge to clash Solar Circle sorcery.
Sorcerous initiation doesn’t aid in clashing necromantic spells or vice versa.
### Enlightenment
The stylist can channel and redirect a clashed spell’s Essence back at the caster, dealing (spell’s Circle ×2) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. This doesn’t reset her Initiative.
