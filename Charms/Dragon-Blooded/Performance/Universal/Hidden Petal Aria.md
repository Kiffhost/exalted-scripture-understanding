The Dragon-Blood expresses multiple layers of meaning via an artistic performance, conveying a secret message through nuances of speech and movement. She may embed a message one sentence long into a performance, conveying it only to select members of her audience. This can incorporate social influence. Magical attempts to detect the message must succeed on a roll at difficulty (higher of her [[Manipulation]] or [[Performance]]).
