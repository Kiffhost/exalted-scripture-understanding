*This Charm hardens the Exalt’s skin, making it incredibly difficult to cut or pierce.*
Against a withering attack, the Solar can pay two motes to apply her [[Stamina]] as soak against unsoakable damage as an instant effect. Against a decisive attack, she may pay six motes after damage has been rolled to create ([[Stamina]]) -0 health levels, which take damage first, effectively shunting the attack away from her bones and vital organs. She still feels the pain of the strike, but a blow that appears to run her through may be shrugged off while drawing a mere trickle or no blood at all. If the created health levels exceed the damage successes for that attack, subsequent attacks’ damage is automatically applied to remaining created -0’s before damage begins registering with her regular health levels. !!Themotesforthedecisiveversion’scostarecommittedindefinitely.!! The Solar keeps her commitment to this Charm for as long as she remains injured; after combat ends, the health levels convert from -0 to -1 wounds, requiring the Solar to seek rest or treatment in order to end the Charm. !!Thesehealthlevelsarethefirsthealedbyanykindofrestor!! magical healing. Healing these levels is the only way to end the Charm; once they are healed they vanish. Undamaged health levels vanish at the end of the scene. The Solar may !!choosetocontinuefightingwhilecarryingshuntedinjuries,!! but each day she does so increases the wound penalty by -1. At [[Essence]] 3+, the Solar may create up to ([[Stamina]] + [[Essence]]) health levels, but choosing to do so changes the cost of the Charm to five motes + one mote for every -0 created beyond the Solar’s [[Stamina]].
