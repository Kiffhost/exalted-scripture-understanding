*Transgressors against death’s law must be brought to justice.*
[[Hateful Scorn Panopticon]] alerts the Abyssal when an organization member acts against an [[Intimacy]] imposed by [[Accursed Overlord Authority]] or witnesses someone else doing so. (This isn’t limited to negative Ties).
If the transgressor is a member of the organization, the Abyssal can reflexively use [[Accursed Overlord Authority]] to impose a Defining Tie of vengeful hatred toward him on that organization, instantly forming one herself. She waives its [[Willpower]] cost against mortals and [[Essence]] 1 ghosts.
