The inexorable cold that radiates from [[Glacial Mantle]] numbs those who stand against its master, leaving their weapons rimed with ice. After an enemy hits the wearer with an attack from close range, she can use this Evocation to unleash a wave of numbing cold against him, causing him to lose one [[Initiative]] (which she doesn’t gain). Against decisive attacks, this [[Initiative]] is taken before calculating damage, not from the attacker’s base [[Initiative]] after resetting.
This Evocation can also be used while grappling or being grappled by a character at close range. The wearer may use it once on each of her turns to drain one [[Initiative]] from the opposing character (which she doesn’t gain).
