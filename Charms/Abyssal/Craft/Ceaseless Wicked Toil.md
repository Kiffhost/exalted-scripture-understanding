*The Abyssal’s hands are never idle, leaving her prepared for every contingency.*
The Abyssal reveals that she’s previously created a mundane object and has it on her, rolling ([[Wits]] + [[Craft]]) at a difficulty of the object’s [[Resources]] rating. She must have a [[Craft]] appropriate to the object, and the object must be something she could have feasibly kept hidden on her.
On a successful roll, the revealed item counts as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580). The Abyssal gains craft points as though she’d completed a [[basic project]] (Exalted, p. 240), even if the object would normally require a [[major project]].
On failure, the Abyssal still produces the object, but it suffers a flaw determined by the [[Storyteller]]: a −1 penalty on all uses, falling apart at end of scene, etc. She doesn’t gain craft points.
## Special activation rules
The Abyssal can use [[Magnificent Cenotaph Allure]] or [[Five-Fold Malice Curse]] when she uses this Charm to confer their effects on the revealed object. These [[Charms]] use the result of [[Ceaseless Wicked Toil]]’s roll instead of their own.
## Reset 
Once per scene.
