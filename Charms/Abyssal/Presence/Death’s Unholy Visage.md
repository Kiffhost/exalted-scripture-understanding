*The Abyssal sloughs off the face she wore in life, revealing what has risen from her grave.*
The Abyssal’s appearance changes as death’s Essence permeates her body. The nature of this transformation depends on whether she has the Hideous Merit (Exalted, p. 162), which she may gain for free as part of learning this Charm.
An Abyssal without Hideous is suffused with deathly beauty: her skin turns deathly pale or colors with rich vitality; her hair darkens or pales; her lips and cheeks flush with blood.
An Abyssal with Hideous decays into a grotesque horror: her eyes sink deeper into her skull; her skin withers, desiccates, or rots away entirely; blood or bile drips from her eyes, mouth, or skin; the scent of death clings to her.
The Abyssal’s altered appearance adds (Essence) nonCharm dice on certain influence rolls. If she doesn’t have Hideous, she does so on persuade and bargain rolls to seduce others and instill rolls to create or strengthen Ties based on desire for the Abyssal. If she has Hideous, she does so on threaten rolls and instill rolls to create or strengthen Ties of fear toward herself.
Whether beautiful or hideous, the Abyssal’s distinctive appearance betrays her nature. She suffers a −(Appearance) penalty on disguise rolls.
With Presence 3, the Abyssal adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice.
