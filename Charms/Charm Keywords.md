Keywords are used to quickly and easily denote that a Charm is using a special rule, or belongs to a particular category that other effects may interact with. A list of keywords follows:

# Solar

#### Aggravated
The [[Health Track]] damage inflicted by this Charm cannot be healed magically, nor can magic be used to speed up the natural process of healing it.
#### Bridge
A Charm with this keyword can be purchased with alternate prerequisites from another Ability. If all the prerequisites used to buy a Bridge Charm enjoy a Caste/Favored cost discount, so does the Bridge Charm. No non-[[Integrity]] Charm can act as a prerequisite for more than one Bridge Charm, and [[Integrity]] [[Charms]] can never serve as an alternate Bridge prerequisite. If [[Integrity]] is Caste or Favored, the character may buy in via half the listed number of Bridge prerequisites (round up, or round down if Supernal).
#### [[Clash]]
Cannot be used simultaneously with or in response to a Charm with the Counterattack keyword.
#### Counterattack
Cannot be used in reaction to a Charm with the Counterattack or [[Clash]] keyword.
#### Decisive-only
If it’s an attack Charm, the Charm can only be used with a decisive attack. If it is a defensive Charm, it can only be used to defend against a decisive attack.
#### Dual
This Charm has two different functions, one for withering and one for decisive. 
#### [[Mute]]
This Charm’s cost will not add to the Exalt’s anima level unless she wants it to.
#### Pilot
The character must be the captain or the helmsman of the sailing vessel to use this Charm.
#### Psyche
A power with this keyword is an unnatural, hypnotic, or sorcerous power that magically influences, controls, or cripples an opponent’s thoughts or feelings.
#### Perilous
Be cautious about your reliance on this Charm! [[Charms]] with this keyword cannot be used in [[Initiative#Crash]].
#### Salient
This keyword indicates that the Charm’s cost requires silver, gold, and white points for major, superior, and legendary craft projects, respectively. -Stackable: This Charm’s effects can stack.
#### Uniform
This Charm has the same function for both withering and decisive attacks or defenses.
#### Withering-only
If it’s an attack Charm, the Charm can only be used with a withering attack. If it is a defensive Charm, it can only be used to defend against a withering attack.
#### Written-only
A Charm with this keyword can only be used to enhance, supplement, or create written social influence.
#### Apocryphal
A Charm with this keyword is non-canonical and not considered to be an actual Charm of the [[Solar Exalted]]. 
##### Apocryphal [[Charms]]
The apocryphal keyword is handed out to [[Charms]] that are narratively unbalanced or outside the functional capacity of Solar powers. This does not discount them for your individual games; you may use or discard an apocryphal Charm just as easily as you may discard or use any standard Exalted Charm as it fits your game. 

The main limitation of Solar [[Charms]] is that they require a very standard method and approach, springing from knowably human actions. But Solar [[Charms]] are by no means hidebound; the [[Charms]] of the social Solar and the occult Solar show some of the strange and interesting conversions possible for those with Solar [[Essence]].

However, you will also notice that such [[Charms]] take a tremendous amount of buy-in and cultivation, and a strange Ability such as [[Occult]] slips into the uncanny much more easily than [[Socialize]]. The strangest Solar [[Charms]] build out of a valid demonstration of the Solar’s capacity with any certain Ability before becoming deviant in any way — and even then, the most eclectic Solar [[Charms]] are still anchored heavily within the limitations of human technique and myth-hero logic. Which is to say, a Solar Charm will never involve taking your eye out and hurling it over the rooftops so you can spy on the streets below.

So apocryphal [[Charms]] are thus because they violate the tenets of skill or technique that make Solar [[Charms]] allowable. Just be aware that if you allow apocryphal [[Charms]] without discernment, you will find it harder to discern Solars from some of the stranger Exalted that appear later in the edition.

# Dragon-Blooded

#### Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Wood
Every Dragon-Blooded Charm has an elemental aspect, typically marked by these keywords. Dragon-Blooded [[Charms]] without these keywords specify what aspects they can take on in their text. 
#### Aura
Aura [[Charms]] can only be used while the Dragon-Blood is in the Elemental Aura that matches its aspect. An Aura Charm can’t be used in the same instant with [[Charms]] of other elements, unless those [[Charms]] have the Balanced keyword. 
#### Balanced
Balanced [[Charms]] don’t interfere with the Dragon-Blood’s Aura even if they don’t match its aspect — they won’t prevent her from entering an Aura at the end of her turn if used with [[Charms]] of another element, and never end her Aura. If she uses only Balanced [[Charms]] on her turn, she may enter the Aura of any of the elements whose [[Charms]] she used. 
#### Excellency
This keyword indicates Dragon-Blooded [[Excellencies]]. 
#### Signature 
This keyword marks an Ability’s five elemental Signatures.
##### Signature [[Charms]] 
Each Ability has five puissant elemental Signatures. A Dragon-Blood can only learn one Signature Charm per Ability. She doesn’t have to pick the Signature Charm that matches her own elemental aspect. At [[Essence]] 5, she unlocks the potential to learn one more Signature Charm from each of her Aspect and Favored Abilities. She must use her second choice to learn the Signature Charm that matches her own Aspect if she hasn’t already done so.

# Lunar

#### Protean
A Protean Charm gains greater power when the Lunar uses it while shapeshifted into certain animal or human forms. (Her own human shape doesn’t count.) 

#### Totemic
Lunars with certain spirit shapes may learn a Totemic Charm as a Charm of a different Attribute than it normally belongs to, using different minimum Attributes and potentially enjoying Caste or Favored Attribute discounts. Totemic [[Charms]] have alternative prerequisite [[Charms]] from this second Attribute, unless they have no prerequisite [[Charms]], or their prerequisites are Totemic themselves. This extends to the Attribute minimums of any automatic upgrades or repurchases of the Charm, but not to any dice rolls or other calculations involved.

#### Archetype
A synonym of [[#Totemic]] used in the Many-Faced Strangers book.

# Sidereal

#### Divination
Divination [[Charms]] are a Sidereal’s powers of foresight, prophecy, and prediction. They’re limited in how much information they can provide on enemies of fate (p. XX). Their presence and actions can be divined, but not their appearance, identity, or specific nature; they are indistinct, featureless voids within prophetic visions. Note that non-Sidereal [[Charms]] that predict the future, like God-King’s Shrike, aren’t Divination [[Charms]]. 

#### Shaping
Shaping effects transforms characters’ bodies, minds, souls, or fates. They can be defended against with magic like [[Destiny-Manifesting Method]] (Exalted, p. 304). 

#### Versatile
[[Archery]], [[Brawl]], [[Melee]], and [[Thrown]] [[Charms]] with this keyword can enhance attacks and parries with [[Martial Arts]] if the Sidereal uses a weapon compatible with that Ability. Versatile [[Charms]] from multiple Abilities can’t enhance the same action.

#### Enlightenment 
Attaining the apex of Sidereal Martial Arts’ power demands an understanding of subtle cosmic principles and a harmony with the nature of reality beyond many students. Sidereals always gain the benefits of a Sidereal Martial Arts’ Enlightenment effects. Getimians access Enlightenment effects based on whether their Essence’s current nature is Flowing or Still. Other Exalted can’t ordinarily access Enlightenment effects.
