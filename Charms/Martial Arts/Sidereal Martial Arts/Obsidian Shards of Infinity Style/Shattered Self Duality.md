*Nothing exists in itself; reality is defined by its reflection.*
The stylist manifests her reflection within close range of herself. Its appearance is almost identical to hers, save for subtle evidence of it having lived a different life, such as a missing tattoo, a scar, or a lack of laugh lines. If there’s a reflective surface that’s at least as large as the stylist is within long range, she may have her reflection emerge from it instead.
This has the following effects
- She and the reflection are treated as a single character, sharing all traits except for their health track. The reflection has (Essence + 3) −0 levels.
- Her player can take actions through either her or her reflection (or both, with a flurry), subject to the usual rules on how many actions she can take in a turn.
- If she flurries one of her actions with one of her reflection’s actions, she ignores flurry penalties and can combine two of the same action, except for attacks. She likewise doesn’t gain this benefit on Shape Sorcery rolls if another effect lets her flurry them.
- If she takes a reflexive move action, both she and her reflection can move.
- She waives Black Shards Fall Like Ice’s Willpower cost.
- Neither she nor her reflection appear in mirrors.
If the stylist’s reflection is incapacitated, it shatters into black glass, reappearing after a day. Until then, the stylist can’t use this Charm.
### Enlightenment
The stylist can transfer any decisive damage her reflection takes to her own health track, or vice versa.
## Special activation rules
The stylist can use this Charm reflexively when she uses this style’s Form.
