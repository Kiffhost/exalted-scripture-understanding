The Dragon-Blood builds her case day by day, every piece of evidence or witness questioned adding another drop to the rising tide of her investigation. As she completes her case, these waters overflow their banks in an overwhelming torrent of revelations. After uncovering a number of clues equal to (higher of her target’s Essence or Larceny) through case scene rolls, profile character rolls, or roleplaying, the Dragon-Blood gains the following benefits until she’s conclusively closed the case: 
-  She adds (Essence) bonus dice on Investigation rolls against her suspect, Awareness rolls opposing his Stealth or Larceny, and on Join Battle rolls against him. 
-  When she uses one or more Investigation Charms targeting him, the total Willpower cost is reduced by one point and their mote cost is muted. 
-  She may treat any social influence that requires her to end the investigation as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). Once she apprehends the suspect and decides on how best to do justice, any influence to deter her from that course is likewise unacceptable. Inescapable Wave Insight can only be used once per story, unless reset by witnessing a serious crime that offends against one of her Defining Intimacies.
