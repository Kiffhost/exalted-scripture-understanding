*The pinnacle of Vainglory’s power is to make manifest its wearer’s hold over the human heart.*
The Exalt hurls [[Vainglory]] at an opponent that she knows has a negative Defining [[Intimacy]] toward her. This is a gambit with a difficulty of the target’s [[Resolve]]. If successful, the crown !!vanishesbloodlesslyintothetarget’schest,encirclinghisheart,!! before reappearing in the Exalt’s hand. An unseen band of [[Essence]] remains wrapped around the target’s heart, binding him to the Exalt’s will. His negative Defining [[Intimacy]] is inverted into a positive Defining [[Intimacy]] that cannot be eroded or altered for the rest of the story This Evocation can only be used once per scene.
