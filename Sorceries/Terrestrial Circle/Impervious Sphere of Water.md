Water streams from the sorcerer’s outstretched palms, twisting and coiling like flowing serpents into a dome that encompasses her and her allies. The dome extends out to short range from the sorcerer, although those within find that they can breathe the water as easily as air. While the dome is translucent, its surface provides [[Cover#Full|full cover]] to those within it against attacks from without, and vice versa. Moving into or out of the dome requires a (Strength + Athletics) roll at a difficulty of (sorcerer’s Intelligence). If the sorcerer takes a move action or non-reflexive action, this spell immediately ends. Once the spell ends, the sphere collapses, and can be collected to drink. 

A sorcerer with this as her control spell can take move actions without ending this spell. The sphere moves with her, although it doesn’t drag those within its area along with it, flowing around them without friction. 
# Distortion 
(Goal Number: 12)
Distorting this spell strips the water of its breathability, causing those within the dome to begin [[Deprivation|drowning]]. It ceases to provide cover to those within (but not without) the dome, and characters may enter (but not exit) the dome without a roll. The dome remains intact even if the sorcerer takes an action that would end the spell.
