Whether it be lightning crackling from a sorcerer’s fingertips or the fires of Hell, the Dragon-Blood diverts deadly energies into her weapon, grounding them harmlessly. She gains +1 non-Charm Parry against an attack made up entirely of [[Essence]] or other magical energy with no physical component, such as [[Elemental Bolt Attack]], and 1s on the attack roll subtract successes.
She can parry such attacks even if they’re unblockable.
In Earth Aura, when one of the Dragon-Blood’s allies within medium range is targeted with an attack made up entirely of [[Essence]] or other magical energy, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Aura to reflexively protect that ally as per a defend other action, diverting the flow of energy toward herself. Even if her Parry is beaten, the attacker must target her, not her ward.
