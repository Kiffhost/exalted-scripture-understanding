The Exalt taps deeply of her Essence, merging ship, sea and self into one form. For the rest of the scene, as long as she is on her ship, add the vessel’s Speed as automatic successes to her movement actions, and the ship’s Maneuverability to her defenses. Any magic which increases these values cannot increase the bonus to these traits by more than +1 each. In addition, regardless of whether she is aboard her ship, she may speak in an ancient maritime tongue that is instinctually understood by oceanic spirits, aquatic raksha, the Lintha family and members of the Niobraran League. She may drink salt water as if it were fresh, and though she can be incapacitated by drowning, she can never die by being submerged, neither from running out of oxygen or by the crushing weight of the depths.
