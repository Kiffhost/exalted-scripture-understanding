*The Infernal’s words draw no distinction between truth and lies, exposing the limits of both concepts.*

The Infernal adds (Socialize) dice and rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on a Manipulation-based influence roll with any Ability. She rerolls 5s as well if her influence is supported by a negative Intimacy, or if her influence is intended to cause emotional harm to her listener.
## [[Keys]]
#### Weak Minds Believe Anything (Socialize 4) (+2m)
For a two-mote surcharge, the enhanced influence roll also counts as an instill roll to create or strengthen a Tie of trust to the Infernal. This fails if the target has a Major or Defining Intimacy that opposes trusting the Infernal.
#### Truth is a Lie (Socialize 5, Essence 3, [[#Weak Minds Believe Anything (Socialize 4) (+2m)|Weak Minds Believe Anything]]) (+1m, 1wp)
The Infernal tells a perfect lie, either in an influence roll enhanced with this Charm or in ordinary conversation. Until the end of the scene, it’s impossible to uncover any sign that she was lying through read intentions rolls, profile character rolls, or even mind-reading magic. Against lie-detecting magic like [[Judge’s Ear Technique]], this forces an opposed roll, with the Infernal rolling (Manipulation + social Ability). She adds (Essence) automatic successes and doubles 8s on the roll.
