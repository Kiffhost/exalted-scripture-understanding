*Great forces sent against the Lunar merely multiply her opportunities for carnage.*
The Lunar adds a non-Charm die to her [[Join Battle]] roll for each nontrivial enemy she faces, maximum (higher of [[Essence]] or 3). If she wins [[Join Battle]], on her first turn, she ignores penalties from flurrying and can flurry an attack with a shapeshifting action.

## Archetype 
Lunars with predatory spirit shapes may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm.
