With a deft flick of her wrist, the Lunar reveals timeless wonders she just happened to have tucked away. Her player declares that she’s had a two-dot artifact with her all along — one she’s previously crafted, looted, stolen, etc. She rolls ([[Wits]] + [appropriate Ability]) at difficulty 7. Regardless of the roll’s outcome, she produces the artifact, but on a failed roll, it’s badly damaged, requiring a repair project to restore to functionality (Exalted, p. 242). She can’t produce artifacts previously established as being in another character’s possession or First Age artifice. If the Lunar has [[Craft]] (Artifacts), a successful roll grants gold points equal to her extra successes, maximum 5. This Charm can only be used once per story.
