The Immaculate’s raw power is all the mightier for her precision, striking a weapon’s weakest point to shatter it. Her disarm gambit destroys a mundane weapon on a success. Alternatively, she may supplement a feat of demolition (Exalted, p. 229), doubling 9s and completing in a miscellaneous action what would normally take longer, such as punching through a brick wall. The Immaculate may expend her Earth Aura to target an artifact weapon with a supplemented disarm gambit, adding its rating to the gambit’s difficulty. Success fractures the weapon, breaking its wielder’s attunement and rendering the artifact unusable until repaired (Exalted, p. 242). Such repair projects only require a single successful roll, rather than an extended action.
