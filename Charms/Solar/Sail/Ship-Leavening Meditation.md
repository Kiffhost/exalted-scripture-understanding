Concentrating on damage to the hull, mast, or rigging, the Exalt sends her [[Essence]] lancing into the ship’s wounds, suffusing them to strengthen timbers, tighten bolts and gaps, and hold frayed gear and sails together. This Charm negates the ship’s hull penalty, and must be dropped and renewed each time that penalty increases.
