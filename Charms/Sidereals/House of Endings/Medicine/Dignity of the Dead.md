*The Sidereal is assured of eloquence in her last words and dignity in her final moments.*
The Sidereal negates penalties on an influence roll from wounds, crippling, poison, fatigue, or deprivation, paying one mote per point. If she lowers an influence rollâ€™s target number, each point of reduction negates a point of penalty for free.
