Sometimes an avalanche sweeps an entire town off the side of a mountain. Sometimes a manse is converted into a geomantic bomb. Sometimes you’re standing beneath the miraculous floating mountain Metagalapa when suddenly it falls on you. These situations produce uncountable damage—apocalyptic destruction totally out of scale with what combat resolution, environmental hazards, and [[Health Track]]s are designed to deal with. When a character is subjected to uncountable damage, the Storyteller decides what happens to him (usually death, although in some cases it might be reasonable to permit a roll to reduce a sure demise down to mere incapacitation). Luckily, the Chosen have a number of Charms which allow them to deal with uncountable damage, such as [[Adamant Skin Technique]].
