*Wandering the wilderness, the Infernal glimpses the secret at the heart of the world: Suffering is truth.*

The Infernal seeks out revelation through a day spent meditating in harsh wilderness, practicing austerities, allowing venomous wildlife to sting her, or similar ascetic or self-flagellating practices. Her player asks the Storyteller for insight into a given topic and makes a difficulty 3 ({Intelligence or Perception} + Survival roll). The Storyteller may increase or decrease this difficulty based on how obscure or wide-ranging the topic is. If the question involves the Infernal’s worshippers, she adds (Cult) automatic successes on the roll.

If the Infernal succeeds, she experiences an epiphany, learning a useful piece of information chosen by the Storyteller. If she seeks information on the Bureau of Destiny’s opposition to her schemes, she might glimpse a location where she’d find an opportunity to impede Sidereal efforts or learn detailed information about them. If she asks about whether an expedition will be profitable, she might receive a vision of an obstacle it might face or the bounty that it might find.

The Infernal banks her extra successes on this roll as bonus dice, and can add up to (higher of Essence or 3) banked dice on rolls with any Ability that benefit from her revelation. This can’t enhance attack rolls. The Infernal can only have banked dice from a single use of this Charm at a time.
