*Forged to protect the privacy and integrity of the Exalted Host’s communications, these artifacts appear as orichalcum signet rings or hand-held seals.*
Such a seal is blank unless attuned for one mote, when its owner’s name appears on its face in [[Language#Old Realm]]. She may change its image at will to any insignia she can rightfully claim as her own.

While sealing a document, the owner may identify an individual — either by name or a unique title, such as “the prince of Fajad” or “Cathak Cainan’s personal secretary.” If anyone but the person thus identified breaks the document’s seal, the message’s contents vanish before they can be read.

Jade versions of this artifact, called auspicious secret seals, are used by a handful of Dynasts and Lookshyan magnates. Most are blue jade, but House Iselsi once favored black jade seals that turned their writing to water, while Cathak herself carried a red jade seal that set a tampered message afire.

When an Exaltation passes to a new hero, these seals recognize both incarnations as the same person. A newly minted Solar can thus open her First Age incarnation’s sealed correspondence without erasing it.
