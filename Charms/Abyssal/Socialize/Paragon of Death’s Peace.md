*Death’s Lawgiver speaks with the authority of eternity, her every proclamation as unassailable as the grave.*
The Abyssal gains the following benefits:
 - Characters can’t use negative [[Intimacy|Tie]]s toward her, her allies, or a group she belongs to bolster their [[Resolve]] against her [[Social Influence|influence]] or resist it in [[Decision Points]].
 - Against mortals and [[Essence]] 1 ghosts, the level of [[Intimacy]] needed to justify her [[persuade]] rolls is lowered by one step (Exalted, p. 216). Against trivial characters, it’s lowered by two steps.
 - She adds ([[Essence]]) to her [[Defense]], [[Guile]], and [[Resolve]].
 - If an enemy initiates hostilities, she and her allies add (her [[Essence]]) automatic successes on the [[Join Battle]] roll.
 - Any decisive damage that would fill her Incapacitated [[Health Track|Health Level]] is negated. She loses this protection while [[Initiative#Crash|crashed]].
This Charm ends if the Abyssal or any of her allies take hostile action, even in self-defense. She can’t reuse it for the rest of the session. Even if she ends the Charm, any such hostile action during the same scene will prevent her from reusing it.
## Reset 
Once per story unless reset by achieving a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).
