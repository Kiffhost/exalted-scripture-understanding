*The Infernal bears witness to world’s hypocrisy, delighting or despairing in the petty failings of those around her.*

The Infernal intuitively senses whenever a character acts in a way that opposes or violates one of his own Intimacies. This doesn’t reveal what the Intimacy in question is, but adds an automatic successes on read intentions rolls to uncover it. This includes acts of hypocrisy that the Infernal isn’t actively paying attention to, though the Storyteller should limit this to revelations that are interesting or narratively relevant. She can’t shut out her awareness of hypocrisy, though this isn’t mentally overwhelming or susceptible to sensory overload.
