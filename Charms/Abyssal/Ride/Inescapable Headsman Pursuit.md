*Death’s Lawgiver rides down her foes, brooking no escape or evasion.*
When the Abyssal makes a mounted rush or disengage, she gains one mote for each 1 on her enemy’s opposed rolls. The can only be spent on [[Ride]] [[Charms]], and are lost if they aren’t used before her next turn ends.
This Charm can also be used in mounted races and other opposed rolls representing contests of speed. The Abyssal must use the motes before the end of the extended roll’s next interval or lose them.
