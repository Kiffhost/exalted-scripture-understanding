Her lungs expanding like a bellows, the wearer exhales a breath like a typhoon. She makes a single withering attack roll with ([[Stamina]] + [Athletics, [[Brawl]], or Performance]) against every opponent in a 90-degree arc out to medium range. This can generally target one opponent at close range, three at short, and five at medium. Each target hit suffers (15 + threshold successes on the attack roll) raw damage. The wearer gains [[Initiative]] only from the target that lost the most [[Initiative]] in the attack. Targets taking 5+ damage are knocked back one range band and fall prone. This Evocation can be used once per combat. An [[Essence]] 4 repurchase allows the wearer to spend two levels of anima to fill her storm-breath with lightning. Every opponent hit by the withering attack also faces a one-time environmental hazard with Difficulty 5, Damage 4L.
