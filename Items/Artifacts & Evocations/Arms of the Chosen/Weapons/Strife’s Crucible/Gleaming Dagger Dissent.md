*Strife’s Crucible believes that only the pure thrill of the duel can truly test Chosen born to rebellion and war.*
The [[Essence]] of Mars pierces the target’s fears and composure, removing mental obstacles to combat. She enhances an influence roll to inspire anger or hostility by incorporating [[Strife’s Crucible]] into a stunt such as issuing a challenge while pointing it at her opponent or performing a weapon kata. A character whose [[Resolve]] is beaten forms a Major [[Intimacy]] of his player’s choice that will encourage him to fight the wielder — either immediately or at a later time — in additional to the influence’s usual effects. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the wielder isn’t dissonant with star metal, this Evocation awakens at no cost when she witnesses a character use strength or martial prowess in a way that offends one of her Major or Defining Principles.
## Resonant

If an enemy provoked by this Evocation initiates hostilities and the wielder designates him as her chosen opponent, she may reflexively clash the first attack he makes against her with a decisive attack. This doesn’t count as her [[combat action]] for the round.
