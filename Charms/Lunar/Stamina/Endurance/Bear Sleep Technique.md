Withdrawing into herself, the Lunar enters a rejuvenating hibernation. The rate at which she heals naturally (Exalted, p. 173) is multiplied by (Essence + Stamina). Time spent hibernating doesn’t count toward the maximum she can go without food or water (Exalted, p. 232). The Lunar may choose to hibernate until she’s fully healed from all damage, or for a set period of time. She isn’t completely unaware of her surroundings while hibernating, and can roll to detect external stimuli with (Perception + Awareness) at a −4 penalty, which can’t be enhanced by non-Excellency magic. Some stimuli, like being slapped across the face or stabbed, are obvious enough to detect without rolling. Detecting external stimuli lets the Lunar end this Charm prematurely. With Stamina 5, the Lunar doesn’t age while hibernating.
