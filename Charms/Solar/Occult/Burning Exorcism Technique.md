*Sometimes those who are physically ill or mentally weak become prey to spiritual possession or another malaise of the soul.*
The Lawgiver may draw the malevolence from such a victim, rolling ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) against the [[Resolve]] of the possessing spirit, or the morbidity of a spiritual malaise. If she succeeds, the Solar draws a malaise or a spirit of equal or lower [[Essence]] into her anima, neutralizing it until she wishes its release. If the spirit is of a greater [[Essence]] than the Solar, then it is automatically forced out of the host, and may not return to the victimâ€™s body for a season, but it is otherwise free. The Exalt may not capture more spirits than she has points of permanent [[Essence]].
