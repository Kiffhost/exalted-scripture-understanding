The Lawgiver whispers the ten koans of utter stillness, each quieter than the next. When she is finished, her concentration is improved, allowing her to swallow even the tiniest sounds. For the duration of this Charm, any [[Awareness]] attempt to detect her by hearing alone loses one success for every 1 and 2 the opponent rolls.
