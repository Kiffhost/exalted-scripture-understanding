When the sorcerer takes a Shape Sorcery action within medium range of a prominent living plant, such as a tree, large hedge, or flower garden, she can draw (Essence) sorcerous motes from it towards the spell. She can also draw power from a wood elemental within medium range, draining (her Essence) motes from him, but only if her Shape Sorcery roll exceeds his Resolve. Each such source can only be tapped once per day. Drawing motes to cast a control spell doesn’t count towards the once-per-day limit.
