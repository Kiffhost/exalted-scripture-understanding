The Sidereal draws her soul’s fire back against her bowstring, unleashing an arrow of anima. The Sidereal fires her anima banner as a decisive attack, resetting it to dim. An enemy damaged by it is wreathed in her anima. Exalted enemies gain levels of anima equal to the Sidereal’s; the un-Exalted manifest the Sidereal’s anima, including her distinctive colors and iconic display, which impairs stealth and disguise as usual (p. XX). They don’t gain her anima powers. The Sidereal can transfer anima to a willing ally without an attack or damage roll. This doesn’t reset her Initiative. Alternatively, the Sidereal can fire her anima without a target, causing it to explode in a blinding flare that extends out to (Anima/2, rounded up) range bands from a point within her weapon’s range. Enemies within the flare must roll (Stamina + Resistance) opposing the attack roll or be blinded, suffering a −3 penalty on vision-based rolls for (Anima) rounds. This doesn’t reset the Sidereal’s Initiative.
