*The Infernal creates intricate, enticing traps out of words and narrative, linguistic puzzle-boxes too delightful to escape.*

The Infernal imbues a text she writes with a tantalizing allure that compels any character who sees it to begin reading it. He doesn’t realize that he’s being influenced. Once he begins reading it, he must do so for at least (Infernal’s Essence) minutes, or until he’s finished. If the influence aligns with one of his Major or Defining Intimacies, he must instead read for at least (Intimacy) hours, if necessary.

If dropping everything to read the text would put him in peril, he’ll only do so if the Infernal’s written influence leverages an Intimacy sufficient to convince him to undertake that level of risk. Otherwise, he’ll wait until he has a safe opportunity to do so. This costs two Willpower to resist, or (Intimacy) Willpower if aligns with an Intimacy as above.

Once a character is exposed to this Psyche effect, he’s immune to it for the rest of the story.

#### Exquisite Temptation Calligraphy (Essence 4)
If the Infernal’s successes on the written influence roll exceed the target’s base Resolve, he can’t spend Willpower to resist this influence.
