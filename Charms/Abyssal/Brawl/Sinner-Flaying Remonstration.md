*The Abyssal’s murderous instincts respond to the slightest provocation with brutal speed, lunging to strike her foe before he can touch her.*
The Abyssal reflexively clashes an attack with a decisive attack.
A [[Brawl]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase reduces this Charm’s cost to four motes if the Abyssal’s wound penalty and her victim’s wound penalty have a combined total of −4 or higher.
