The Solar’s perfect form is quicker than an eyeblink and more tractile than water. Once per scene, the Solar may invoke this Charm to dodge any attack from any source without a contest. The Solar’s anticipation of harm is so perfect that she can even evade recurring uncountable damage with a single use. As a cyclone tears apart a mountain, the Exalt steps through the vortex unharmed. As the Pole of Earth spills down atop her, she escapes into the seeps and fissures of the world, moving like a fleeing shadow. This Charm may be reset by using Reed in the Wind to dodge three decisive attacks from dangerous opponents.
