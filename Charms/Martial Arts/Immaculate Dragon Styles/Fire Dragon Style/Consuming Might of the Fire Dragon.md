A swirling flame erupts from the Immaculate’s crown chakra, engulfing her in a deadly blaze. Upon entering Fire Dragon Form, she may pay five motes and one Willpower to enhance it. She treats her Initiative as (Wits) points higher to determine when she acts each round, and for the purposes of Charms of this style or similar effects that offer benefits against lower-Initiative foes. Withering attacks gain (Strength/2, rounded up) Overwhelming, while decisive attacks add one die of damage. An enemy that hits her from close range suffers one die of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. The Immaculate’s blazing aura grows stronger as she defeats her foes. Each nontrivial enemy she incapacitates or battle group she successfully routs adds one to the Initiative bonus, Overwhelming bonus, decisive damage bonus, and damage dealt to enemies that hit her.
