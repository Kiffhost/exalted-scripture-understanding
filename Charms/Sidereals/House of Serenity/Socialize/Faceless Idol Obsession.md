*Leash-and-Collar Wisdom Cutting away her identity, the Sidereal deepens the feelings of her would-be masters into obsession, becoming a faceless object of their desires.*
The Sidereal wordlessly makes a special ({Appearance or Manipulation} + [[Socialize]]) instill roll, ignoring multiple target penalties, against all characters with positive Ties toward her or [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that reflect a feeling of dominance over her or desire to exploit her. Affected characters treat those Ties as Obsessions of equal intensity (Exalted, p. 169) with the Sidereal, and must immediately roll against the [[Derangement]] and the Sidereal’s [[arcane fate]]. Weakening these Ties voluntarily costs two [[Willpower]], and characters can’t do so while interacting with the Sidereal. [[Influence]] rolls to weaken them face the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221). Obsessed characters experience [[arcane fate]] differently. It erases all memory of the Sidereal except for the fact of her existence and an obsessed character’s emotions involving her, even if she has a resplendent destiny. A paramour might remember promenading with someone he was infatuated with, but nothing else. Their rolls against her [[arcane fate]] suffer +1 target number, and victims don’t benefit from any intrinsic immunity to [[arcane fate]]. Pointing out a gap in a victim’s memories works as overturning influence.
