*Transgressors against death’s law must be brought to justice.*
Hateful Scorn Panopticon alerts the Abyssal when an organization member acts against Accursed Overlord Authority’s Intimacy or witnesses someone else doing so. (This isn’t limited to negative Ties).
If the transgressor is also an organization member, the Abyssal can instantly form a Defining Tie of hatred toward him and reflexively use Accursed Overlord Authority to impose the Intimacy on that organization. She waives its Willpower cost against mortals and Essence 1 ghosts.
