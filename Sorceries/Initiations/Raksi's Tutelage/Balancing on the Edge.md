Once per story, after rolling Shape Sorcery, the sorcerer may propose a twist or caveat for the spell being shaped — something that diminishes the spell’s effect or her control over it, but doesn’t negate its purpose or function. A Death of Obsidian Butterflies might veer off course, inflicting collateral damage on bystanders as well as targeted foes; her Peacock Shadow Eyes might continue to shine noticeably for hours.
If the Storyteller accepts, she reflexively makes a second Shape Sorcery roll. If she used an Excellency to enhance the first roll, she applies the same benefits to the second one for free — and, if she’s shaping her control spell, she likewise carries over the benefits of all effects that enhanced her first roll.
