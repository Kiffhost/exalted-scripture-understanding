*The Infernal reveals the laws of god and man for the joke that they are, bidding those who labour under them to heed only their own will.*

The Infernal subverts the laws of a region in which she oversees a criminal enterprise, limited only by the scope of her organization’s reach. This takes hold of any characters within the region who engage in her organization’s criminal dealings (knowingly or not) or choose to overlook such crimes, imposing the following:
- If they have Principles based on belief in or obedience to laws or positive Ties toward authority figures, governments, or rule-imposing organizations, they’re treated as one step weaker if they’re Defining or suppressed entirely if they’re Major or Minor. A character can spend three Willpower to restore a Major or Defining Intimacy. Once (Infernal’s Essence) Intimacies have been restored, any remaining Intimacies are also restored (including Minor Intimacies). Mortals and First Circle demons can only restore Defining Intimacies and aren’t automatically freed after restoring (Essence) Intimacies.
- They gain +1 Resolve against influence that opposes illegal activities aligns with the kinds of Intimacies this Charm suppresses or opposes illegal activities.
- They suffer −1 Resolve against influence that encourages criminal activity or support for it or that oppose the kinds of Intimacies this Charm suppresses or opposes illegal activities.
- Affected characters can’t spend Willpower to resist [[Shameless Devil Stride]].
- Once per session, the Infernal can waive [[Crown-Seizing Sneer]]’s cost when she uses it against an affected character.
- If she has [[Forbidden Endeavor Clientele#Preeminent Wickedness Advertising (Larceny 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)|Forbidden Endeavor Clientele (Preeminent Wickedness Advertising)]], it extends that Charm’s range to the entirety of the affected region.
