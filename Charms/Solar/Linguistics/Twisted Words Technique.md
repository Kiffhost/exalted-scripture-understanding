Concentrating on the formation of sounds and the weight of certain meanings, the Solar shapes her words like a weapon. This Charm is a mental attack disguised as social influence, entailing a written or spoken action made with ([[Manipulation]] + [Linguistics or another relevant Social Ability]). The Solar must target an [[Intimacy]] when using this Charm—exploiting something the character cares about to get him to accept influence. However, upon success, the target will feel overwhelmingly compelled to act in a way that is the opposite of what she agreed to, as if her [[Intimacy]] had been inverted. For example, a Solar convinces an Immaculate priest of the evils of the harlotry in Great Forks, convincing her to shun the temple prostitutes. The priest agrees vehemently, and then goes to live with them. Likewise, a Solar forced to brainwash a Circle member could outwardly torture him, while actually strengthening his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] of love for her and his understanding of why his suffering is necessary. Once successful, persuasion caused by this Charm can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]] until another character successfully dissuades the target from a chosen course of action (p. 221), and upon doing so, the target must pay (Solar’s [[Essence]]) [[Willpower]] to break free. [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] tainted by this Charm are more insidious— they are both harder to root out, but also indecipherable from what a character truly believes. While [[Transcendent Hero’s Meditation]] (p. 308) can shatter persuasion caused by this Charm, it can’t change the Solar’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], though it does make her realize how she’s been influenced.
