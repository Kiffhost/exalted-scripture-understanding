*The Sidereal sways public opinion to her cause’s side, revealing her opposition’s iniquities.*
To invoke this Charm, the Sidereal must be using Worthy Cause Demonstration, unless she’s actually a member of the group she’s representing. After a few hours or days spent advocating for the group she represents, participating in public events put on by them, or suffering public persecution, she makes a special (Charisma + Serenity Ability) instill roll against all characters who interacted with her during this time.
Success instills a Major Tie of sympathy to the Sidereal’s group and a Major Tie of condemnation toward the other. If an affected character has a Major or Defining Intimacy that opposes one of these Intimacies, then that Tie is instilled at Minor intensity instead. When the Sidereal uses Worthy Cause Demonstration while interacting with affected characters, these count as one step higher, instead of that Charm’s usual effect.
Voluntarily eroding one of these Intimacies costs three Willpower per step. If both are fully eroded, the character is freed from this effect.
## Reset
Once per story.
