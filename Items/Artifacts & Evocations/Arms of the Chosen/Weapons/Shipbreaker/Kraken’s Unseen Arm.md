Having snared a vessel with its power, Shipbreaker draws the leash tight. When a ship the Exalt is on makes a naval maneuver roll, it gains one bonus success for each cumbrous bolt embedded in the ship it opposes, up to a maximum of (Essence) bonus successes. In normal combat, when the wielder attempts a rush action or contests a disengage action, she gains one automatic success for each cumbrous bolt embedded in the target, up to a maximum of (Essence) bonus successes.
