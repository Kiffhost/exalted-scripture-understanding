*With a deft twist of Tulat’s heel, his wearer unwinds the fate of foes sent flying.* The wearer can use Passage-Erasing Step after a successful smash attack or other action using Tulat’s Tread that moves an enemy or object. If successful, he returns to his initial position, as usual, but still suffers any harm he normally would from moving. She gains one Initiative. If the wearer incapacitates an enemy, she may kick him out of her presence entirely, sending him back to somewhere he’s been in the last day or so, chosen by the Storyteller. Sidereals with Avoidance (p. XX) may use it reflexively, waiving its Willpower cost and the need to roll, to follow him and erase memories of both of them. This Evocation’s cost is waived when used on an attack enhanced by To Walk Unbeheld. 
## Resonant
If an enemy is crashed by a withering attack, the wearer may reflexively make a decisive attack against him when he returns. If she does so with an attack that forces movement, she adds any range bands of movement undone by this Evocation to the distance he moves.
