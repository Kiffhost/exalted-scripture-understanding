The Lunar breathes in the world’s [[Essence]], revealing the past. She cases a scene instantly with ([[Perception]] + [Awareness, [[Investigation]], or Survival]) to reconstruct a specific event, subtracting one success per day since it occurred. This can’t be negated by [[Sense-Sharpening Change]] or [[Heightened Sense Method]]. Success lets her mentally reconstruct a single scene from the scents of the people and things involved. She identifies any characters she knows, gets a general description of unknown characters, and discerns all characters’ movements and emotional states. She can’t usually discern visual or auditory details, such as an unknown character’s appearance or the content of a conversation, but creative stunting may circumvent this. Certain conditions increase the time interval used in determining the roll’s penalty. Each applicable condition increases it by one step (from days, to weeks, to months, to seasons, to years): 
-  The Lunar has used [[Prey’s Scent Discernment]] to memorize the scent of a character who was present. 
-  She’s pursuing an investigation that upholds one of her or her Solar mate’s Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. 
-  A character she has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward was present. Her Solar mate always counts, including past incarnations. 
-  She has [[Essence]] 5+.
