*The Infernal's soul unfolds beyond her fingertips, brushing distastefully against an unworthy world.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- Her sense of touch extends out to short range, letting her make touch make touch-based Perception rolls without contact. She can do so through physical barriers, though she may suffer a penalty depending on its thickness. She can’t exert any actual pressure, but subjects of her active attention can detect it as a phantom sensation with a difficulty 3 (Perception + Awareness) roll. While using [[Mind-Hand Manipulation]], her sense of touch extends to that Charm’s range.
- She adds two dice on touch-based Awareness rolls, including rolls opposing the Stealth of characters within range. The Storyteller should give her wide leeway in stunting incredible feats, albeit potentially at high difficulties, like feeling out a budding tumour or identifying the brush used for a painting’s strokes.
- She ignores two points of penalty for examining small details.
- She can make a touch-based Awareness roll to sense whether a character is subordinate or inferior within a legal, social, or metaphysical hierarchy (including First and Second Circle demons). It’s difficulty 3 by default, but may require a roll against a character’s Guile, disguise roll, or the like if he’s taken steps to conceal that status.

This Charm lasts one scene for three motes or indefinitely for six motes, one Willpower.
### Keys
#### Expansive Proprioception Scan (Awareness 5, Essence 3)
This Charm’s range extends to medium, or one range band beyond [[Mind-Hand Manipulation|Mind-Hand Manipulation's]] range. She converts this Charm’s bonus to automatic successes against subordinates and inferiors. She can instantly scan and visualize objects and tangible phenomena like wind within range without a roll, learning spatial details such as size, shape, and the direction and velocity of movement.
