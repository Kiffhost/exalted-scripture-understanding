The Lunar’s body subdues and subsumes pestilence. She adds an automatic success on rolls to resist disease. After successfully rolling to resist exposure to a disease or overcome a contracted disease, the Lunar may retain it within her body. She suffers no ill effects, but remains a vector for contagion and can transmit it through Rabid Beast Bite. She may choose to lower the disease’s virulence by up to (Essence), minimum 1, when she exposes another character to it, letting her spare allies and innocents. She can expel a carried disease as a miscellaneous action. Incurable diseases like the Great Contagion are unaffected by this Charm.
