*The Green Sun Prince will not be denied her vengeance.*

The Infernal swears to avenge a significant wrong committed against her or one of her Intimacies, forming a Minor Intimacy appropriate to her vengeance. The Intimacy can’t be fully eroded, only reduced to Minor intensity, and the Infernal adds +2 Resolve against influence opposed by it. She can’t voluntarily weaken the Intimacy.

If the Infernal achieves her vengeance in a narratively significant way, she gains one Willpower. If she ends this Charm before her revenge is complete, she gains one Limit.
