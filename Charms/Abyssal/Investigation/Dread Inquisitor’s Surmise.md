*The Abyssal has come to expect crime and vice from those around her, and rarely finds herself disappointed.*
Whenever a character the Abyssal can perceive makes a [[Larceny]] roll, she is intuitively aware of this fact and adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice on an [[Awareness]] or [[Investigation]] roll to detect this use of [[Larceny]].
She also gains this benefit when a disguised character attempts to do something he couldn’t without the benefit of the disguise — such as walking past guards keeping out all but a select few — even if he doesn’t roll [[Larceny]].
