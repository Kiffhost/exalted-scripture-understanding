The Immaculate’s hands cut through the air as she executes a rapid kata and draws a deep cleansing breath, respiring the Essence of the Air Dragon. Her withering chakram attacks are treated as made from close range to determine their Accuracy bonus, regardless of the actual distance. She gains +1 Evasion, and adds an automatic success on disengage rolls and Stealth rolls.

## Special activation rules 

When the Immaculate deals enough withering damage to lower a foe’s Initiative from a rating higher than her own to a lower rating, she may reflexively enter this Form.
