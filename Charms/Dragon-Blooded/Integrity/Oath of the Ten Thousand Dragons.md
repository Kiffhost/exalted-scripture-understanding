The Dragon-Blood swears a vow of personal fealty to a character she holds a Tie of loyalty towards, or swears to complete a task at the request of such a character. She gains +2 Resolve against any influence that would weaken or alter that Tie (if she promised personal loyalty), or that would dissuade her from completing the task. This Charm can only be used once per story. If the Dragon-Blood maintains it through multiple stories, she cannot use it again until sheâ€™s ended it and a new story begins.
