Savoring the taste of slain divinity, the Lunar subsumes its nature into her own. Upon permanently killing a character, she may access any of his Eclipse Charms (Exalted, p. 514) of whose Essence minimums she meets, committing three motes per Charm. She may have up to (Essence) Eclipse Charms accessed through God-Body Consumption at a time, either through a single use or multiple stacked activations. The Lunar may permanently learn Charms accessed through God-Body Consumption for eight experience points each. She no longer needs to commit motes to use such Charms, and they don’t count toward the maximum of (Essence). She waives the experience point cost of the first Eclipse Charm purchased this way. If the Lunar uses Charms to perform a non-lethal sacred hunt, she may trigger God-Body Consumption to take the Eclipse Charms of a God-Blood, Eclipse Caste Solar, or similarly empowered human when she takes his shape.
