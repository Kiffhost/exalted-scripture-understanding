The Solar can teach the land to hone its masters. With use of this Charm, each time the Exalt uses [[Wyld-Shaping Technique]] to build a place of trade, practice, or service, her creation will also produce a specialist to work there. This works through a system of conceptual graduation: if she shapes forest lands, the people who rise from her working will be forest people. If she creates a blacksmith’s forge, one of the arisen mortals will be a blacksmith with an appropriately high [[Craft]] score. If she creates a hunting lodge, her working will produce hunters. If she creates a medicine hut, her land will produce a shaman-healer, and so on.
