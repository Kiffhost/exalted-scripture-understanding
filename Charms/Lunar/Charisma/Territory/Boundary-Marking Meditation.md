Laying her mark upon the world, the Lunar claims a land as hers. She claims a single contiguous region no more than (Essence x 10) square miles as her territory. To do so, she must fully master the land she wishes to claim. She must physically traverse the majority of the region. Any mortal communities living in the territory must accept her presence — they need not make her their leader, but must acknowledge her presence and that they lack the ability or desire to force her out. Finally, if any supernatural beings — such as spirits or fellow Exalted — occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Lunar must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge. Land already claimed by another Lunar’s BoundaryMarking Meditation can’t be taken from him unless he voluntarily relinquishes it or dies. Upon claiming a territory, the Lunar’s player chooses three qualities that describe it, e.g. fertile, shadowy, and dense for a thick forest, or open, windy, and guarded for a steppe village. When a character within the territory takes an action that’s supported by any of these qualities, like foraging in a fertile woodland, he’s treated as having an applicable specialty. When a character takes an action opposed by a quality, like a general enacting a Strategic Maneuver roll to march a large army through the dense forest, each such quality imposes a −1 penalty. The Lunar never suffers these penalties. She can reflexively render a character she perceives immune to her territory’s penalties, or deny him its benefits. Story events may cause a territory to lose qualities — if the forest burns down, it’s no longer shadowy or dense. Once per story, the Lunar may change a territory’s qualities, replacing lost qualities and potentially swapping existing qualities for new ones as fits the story. A Lunar can’t have more than (higher of Essence or 3) territories. Her control of a territory ends if she voluntarily revokes it, or upon her death.
