*The Solar argues from her beliefs, persuading listeners with the depth of her emotion.*
This Charm supplements a persuade action, granting the Solar one automatic success. In addition, when the Solar argues from a [[Intimacy|Principle]] she holds, she gains two, three, or four bonus dice, based on the intensity of the [[Intimacy|Principle]]. In essence, this Charm persuades a character to act as the Solar would act. She might argue from her own compassionate principles to convince her target to be merciful or generous, or principles reflecting temperance, to convince the target to abstain from debauchery, vice, dereliction or iniquity. Likewise she might invoke valorous [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] to urge courageous action, or she might sell a course of action with the force of her conviction.
