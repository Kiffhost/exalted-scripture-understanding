The Lawgiver pens a soul-shattering missive, convincing her subject he leads a pointless existence. This Charm can only be directed at a specific target. Roll the Exalt’s ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Linguistics), rerolling 6s until 6s fail to appear. If she beats her target’s Resolve, his soul falls off and sinks directly into lethe. This Charm only targets characters who have unintelligibly abstruse Intimacies or no Intimacies at all; however, its effect depends on such an unfulfilled soul’s yearning for purpose and meaning—characters who are incapable of feeling (such as the soul-eaten victims of the Fair Folk) are not valid targets for this Charm.
