*The Infernal cannot be caged, labouring tirelessly and furiously to shatter her prison’s walls.*

The Infernal adds an automatic success and rerolls 1s until they cease to appear on a roll with any Ability to escape physical restraint or confinement: a Larceny roll to pick the lock on her cell’s door, a feat of strength to shatter her manacles, a Brawl roll to resist an enemy’s grapple, an influence roll to win her captors’ sympathy. This can’t be used to help others escape — the Infernal’s freedom comes first.

This Charm can be used to enhance attack rolls, but only if the Infernal’s enemy is actively restraining her or blocking the only exit from a confined space.
## [[Keys]]
#### Freedom-Seizing Fury
On unopposed Larceny rolls, the Infernal successfully overcomes the obstacle or restraint even if she fails the roll. Instead, failure indicates an unfortunate development: she draws a guard’s attention, breaks her lockpicks, triggers a trap, etc. This doesn’t apply on rolls against supernatural restraints or barriers, like a gaol-manse’s locks or sorcerously enchanted manacles.
#### Shattered Chains Escape (Larceny 4)
The Infernal can use this Charm to help free others, as long as her roll directly contributes to their liberation. If she frees a character this way, he forms a Minor Tie of gratitude to her.
