The Sidereal escapes from bad into worse, trading imprisonment for the perils of freedom. When the Sidereal rolls to pick a lock, she succeeds even on a failed roll. Instead, her failure introduces some complication: her tools break, a guard catches her, she can’t pick the lock quickly enough to evade the Lunar chasing her, etc. If opening the lock would directly imperil the Sidereal — e.g., the chest she’s opening is trapped or there are enemies on the other side of the door she’s unlocking — she succeeds automatically without needing to roll. This Charm can also enhance rolls with any Ability to bypass esoteric barriers and obstructions, like a curtain of sorcerous flame or a ring of runes that render a door immovable, but it doesn’t let the Sidereal make a roll if she couldn’t normally attempt one.
