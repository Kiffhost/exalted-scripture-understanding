The [[Essence]] of the universe flowing through her mind, the Solar draws on a library of words as deep as the celestial vault. This Charm magnifies the Solar’s ability to compose massive volumes of complex information, allowing her to complete difficult manuscripts with increased speed. This Charm supplements an extended roll to produce such work (see p. 221), automatically reducing the interval by one unit, from years to seasons, seasons to months, and months to weeks. While this Charm greatly speeds the Solar’s efforts, it does not directly influence the mechanical speed with which she lays down words—her speed is increased by a streamlining of thought processes and an amplification of the mental faculties that surround vocabulary and dissemination skills, rather than an increase of manual dexterity. The Exalt must use this Charm against each interval she wishes to shorten, and must be able to dedicate the required time and writing instruments to the task. If this Charm is used in combination with its prerequisite, ignore this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost. A repurchase at [[Essence]] 4+ allows the Exalt to pay twelve motes, one [[Willpower]], to reduce an interval by two units. Reducing the work of years to months, or seasons to weeks is a challenging feat if the Solar does all the work mentally; if she is physically writing, she may need [[Whirling Brush Method]] to keep up with the speed at which she can process ideas. The Lawgiver may not yet reduce production time of a tome to less than a unit of weeks. A second repurchase at [[Essence]] 5+ allows the Exalt to pay fifteen motes, one [[Willpower]], to reduce an interval by a full three units of time. An Exalt with this Charm can reduce the time it takes to produce work from years to weeks, and from months to hours. If the Lawgiver is writing as she works, she will not get the full speed of her creative process without the use of [[Whirling Brush Method]], and even then, she may be seen to spend several sleepless nights constructing single massive works.
