*Singing softly in a minor key, the Nightingaleâ€™s voice cuts through the clangor of the battlefield, stilling the hearts and calming the nerves of her allies. Then, shifting into a major key with a triumphant flourish, her voice swells with glory and wrath, a battle-anthem to turn the tide of wars.*
The martial artist and all allies who can hear the song gain a single point of [[Willpower]] at the start of each turn, which must be spent to resist influence or add a success to an action before their next turn. This can raise characters above their permanent [[Willpower]]. This bonus [[Willpower]] disappears after one turn if unused. 
## Terrestrial
A Dragon-Blood must pay four motes for each round after the first she wishes to maintain the effects of this Charm, in addition to its committed cost.
