*Striking at the pattern of her foe’s Essence, the stylist impedes and redirects its flow.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have Initiative 10+.
When she deals decisive damage, she may forgo (his Essence/3, rounded up) levels of damage to negate one of her target’s ongoing magical effects. This doesn’t affect Permanent Charms. This Charm can also enhance grapples, letting the Sidereal forgo (enemy’s Essence) rounds of control to negate an effect.
