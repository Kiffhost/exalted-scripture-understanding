*Pra Gita’s razored talons extend outward for a single breath, proving that no one is beyond the reach of revenge.*
The wielder can make a withering or decisive attack against an enemy within short range. Against the unfaithful, the attack’s range increases to medium and she adds an automatic success on the attack roll.
## Resonant
Once the wielder hits an enemy with this Evocation, she waives its cost against him for the rest of the scene or until she attacks a different enemy.
