The Sidereal stands tall as a legend of the battlefield to every soldier who has ever fought for her. Characters who’ve served under the Sidereal’s command count as having a Minor Tie of respect to her. If the Sidereal makes an influence roll to convince such a character to rejoin a military she commands, it’s treated as a Major Tie for that roll unless he has a negative Tie to her. If any such characters have negative Ties applicable to the Sidereal that aren’t directly toward her (e.g. a Tie of contempt for the Sidereal Exalted as a whole), their intensity is treated as one step lower when applied to her.
