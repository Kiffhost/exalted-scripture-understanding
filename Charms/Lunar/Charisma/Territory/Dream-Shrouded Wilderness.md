*Whispering to the land’s heart, the Lunar suffuses it with dreams of moonlit passion.*
She makes a ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) instill or persuade roll, imbuing her influence throughout a territory claimed with [[Boundary-Marking Meditation]]. The first time a given character sleeps in the territory each story, he’s subjected to her influence as he experiences the land’s dream. This Charm ends if the Lunar goes more than a season without visiting the territory. If the Lunar knows [[Moonstruck Reverie Trick]], she may use it reflexively with this Charm, committing its mote cost to convey its influence through the dreams this Charm causes. This is incompatible with Moonstruck Reverie Trick’s repurchase effect.
