Abyssals seeking spiritual communion with the [[Neverborn]] learn to hear the Whispers of the dead titans, an almost-silent susurrus that is the dead titans’ perpetual death rattle. Those who wander the Labyrinth may come to hear them too, as the [[Deathlords]] have; ghosts who do so are sometimes called specters. There are no words, no demands, no explanations; the Neverborn speak in cryptic premonitions and nightmarish visions. Those who listen to Whispers can glean insight and meaning from them, but they take a heavy toll on minds never meant to bear them and unable to shut them out.
Once per session, a character with Whispers can pay one [[Willpower]] to invoke one of the following benefits:
- [[Introducing a Fact|introduce a fact]] about death, the undead, the [[Underworld]], or [[necromancy]] without requiring an applicable [[Lore]] background, or add (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) non-Charm dice if she has one.
- Add (higher of Essence or 3) non-Charm dice on any roll to navigate the Underworld or avoid the perils of its terrain, or on rolls to understand the thoughts and passions of the undead (including [[read intentions]] and [[Profile Character]] actions).
- Add (higher of Essence or 3) necromantic motes towards a spell she is shaping. This isn’t compatible with [[sorcery]].
- Call on her Whispers in a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] as though they were a Major [[Intimacy]] of nihilistic despair and enmity towards all living things — or, for characters with four-dot Whispers, a Defining [[Intimacy]].
Characters with four-dot Whispers can do so once per day instead.
Some Abyssal Charms have the [[Charm Keywords#Whispers|Whispers keyword]], granting additional benefits to characters with this [[Merit]].
## Drawback
Whispers can distract or overwhelm those receptive to them. Once per session, the Storyteller may inflict either a –(Whispers) penalty on a social or mental roll, or a −1 penalty to Resolve or Guile for an instant. The player can describe what alien or horrifying sensations her character experiences as part of her stunt.
