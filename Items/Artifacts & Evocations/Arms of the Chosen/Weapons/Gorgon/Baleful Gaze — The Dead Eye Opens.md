This Evocation can only be used when the eye on Gorgon’s blade is at least half-open.
*The eye fixes an opponent with its ghastly stare, such that its glittering malice holds him in thrall.* 
Snaring the target’s gaze requires a special ([[Dexterity]] + [[Melee]]) gambit with a difficulty of the target’s [[Resolve]], which can be made out to short range. If this gambit succeeds, the target is paralyzed and cannot take any physical or social actions, even reflexive ones, save to defend himself with a −2 penalty to [[Defense]]. 
To maintain this paralysis, Gorgon’s master must continue to roll [[Initiative]] on each subsequent turn against the target’s [[Resolve]]; this doesn’t require an attack roll, and only costs a single point of [[Initiative]] on each turn after the first. Gorgon’s paralysis is broken if the target’s view of Gorgon’s eye is entirely blocked for a full turn; the Exalt takes any [[Combat Action]] other than moving or maintaining control; either the Exalt or the target is struck by an attack or otherwise harmed; or the distance between them exceeds this Evocation’s maximum range. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with [[Gorgon]] cannot awaken this Evocation. 

## Resonant

This Evocation’s range is extended to medium range, and the wielder doubles 10s on all [[Initiative]] rolls for this Evocation.
