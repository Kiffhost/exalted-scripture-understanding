*Bending a beast to her will, the deathknight empowers her steed with dark [[Essence]]..*
The Abyssal imposes a mental bond on a touched animal she intends to ride as a mount, giving the steed – 1 [[Resolve]] against her persuade and threaten rolls, and reducing any penalties she suffers on [[Survival]] rolls to train it by one. The mount counts as a creature of darkness for this Charm’s duration.
This bond also empowers the deathknight’s steed. Upon purchasing this Charm, her players picks two of the boons below. Additional boons can be purchased for three experience points or one bonus point.
Fear-Killing Exercise: The mount is never spooked or frightened by indirect circumstances, including the presence of the undead and being in the Underworld. If its [[Resolve]] is beaten by fear-based influence, the Abyssal can spend one mote after the roll to negate it. This also renders the mount immune to fearbased influence for (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]).
Forceful Spirit Spur: The Abyssal can call the mount to her side with a brief sensation of phantom spurs digging into its flanks. If willing, the mount makes its way to her as circumstances best allow, adding ([[Ride]]) dice on any rolls necessary to do so.
Ghoul-Steed’s Hunger: As long as the mount’s diet consists primarily of raw meat, it gains [[Exalted Healing]] (Exalted, pp. 165-166). . Even normally herbivorous animals are both able and willing to do so.
[[Ride]] Beyond Death: If a living mount dies, it’s reanimated as a zombie animal (p. XX). The Abyssal may spend one mote to reduce an undead mount’s wound penalty by one for a tick.
Tireless Charger Technique: While riding the mount, the Abyssal can spend one mote reflexively to suffuse it with deathless vitality for (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) hours. Any fatigue penalties it suffers it reduces are one, and exertion during that time won’t cause it to tire or accrue further fatigue penalties.
Unfaltering Deathknight’s Steed: The Abyssal is sure in her saddle, and will never fall off the mount unless another character actively intervenes, even if asleep or unconscious. She gains +1 [[Defense]] against attacks that might knock her from her mount. Even if such an attack succeeds, she can spend one mote reflexively after the damage roll to stop herself from falling off.
The Abyssal’s player may work with the [[Storyteller]] to create new boons.
