Zelator penetrates dark magic with contemptuous ease. When supplementing a baneful attack, this Evocation adds one automatic success on the attack roll, and ignores four points of soak on withering attacks and four points of [[Hardness]] on decisive attacks. 

## Resonant

Waive this Evocationâ€™s [[Willpower]] cost when used with an impaling attack (Exalted, p. 203).
