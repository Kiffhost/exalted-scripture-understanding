*As demagogues and sycophants speak, the wielder deprives their words of weight with a flourish of the sabers and a display of disarming wit.*
When someone makes a spoken influence roll, the wielder opposes it with a special (Social Attribute + [[Martial Arts]]) roll. She must use the sabers as part of this, though it need not be aggressive or hostile. If successful, her roll is also applied as an instill roll against all characters targeted by the original influence, instilling a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of contempt to the speaker. This [[Intimacy]] automatically opposes his influence. If a character already has an opposing [[Intimacy]], its [[Resolve]] bonus increases by one instead. 
## Resonant
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the wielder can pay a five-mote surcharge to negate the influence roll entirely and prevent him from repeating it for the rest of the scene if she beats the roll. She canâ€™t use this effect against the same influence for the rest of the story.
