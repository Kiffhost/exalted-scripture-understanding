*The Dragon-Blood may activate this Charm when her mount would take decisive damage, after any attack roll but before damage is rolled.*
She may spend up to ([[Essence]]) [[Initiative]] to subtract that many dice from the damage roll. Outside of combat, such as riding through an environmental hazard, she always subtracts ([[Essence]]) dice.
