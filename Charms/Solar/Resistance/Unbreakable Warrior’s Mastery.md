*Through the course of lifetimes, the Solar has felt a rain of blows that would shatter any mortal.*
Through this Charm, she knows all harm at once, and yet the greater truth is that she still exists, unbowed and unbroken. When struck with a crippling attack, the Solar may use this Charm to trade irreparable or permanent harm for a lesser effect of a shorter duration. Instead of her eye being gouged out, it is closed by a glancing blow; instead of her arm being shattered, it simply hangs limp. Halve the penalty (round down) associated with a successful crippling attack, and eliminate it after (7 [[Stamina]]) turns.
