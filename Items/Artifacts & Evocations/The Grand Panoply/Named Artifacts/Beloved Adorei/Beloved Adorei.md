Auravash the [[Twilight]] craftsman saw a need for the daiklave Adorei when he looked upon the [[Dawn]] of his Circle, Brother of Brothers, [[Night]] of His Heart, whom he considered to be an idiot and perhaps the single greatest reaver the Celestial Host had ever produced. He also saw a man who sowed his oats with gods and devils, spirits of the Wyld and the protected daughters of princes and the select and inviolate priestesses of various cults. Auravash forged Adorei to save the Idiot of His Heart from causing a national scandal, touching off a war, or bringing down the Deliberative on the heads of their Circle. Adorei was to be the perfect defender: powerful, temperate, and empathic. It would guide the unruly [[Dawn]] to true greatness, instilling him with a sense of decency and balance. When Auravash awoke the blade, he heard her sigh with relief to have finally been made, and he was glad, for he could feel the stolid power emanating from the inviolable weapon. But Adorei fell madly in love with the Twilight’s Brother of Brothers and he ruined the daiklave as surely as he’d ruined the resolve of countless temple priestesses. The [[Dawn]] and his blade were inseparable, and she exulted in his prowess, increasing it by allowing him to understand his opponents on the instinctual level, in order to find a way to defeat them. It would not be the sword to settle the Dawn’s wild heart, but a Lunar named Ashala. But that is a tale for another day. Adorei was lost in the fires of the Usurpation, and now it sits clasped in the lid of a sarcophagus in a lonely tomb, where its living glow pines for love of the Solar who would carry it into the light of Creation once again. Adorei has three hearthstone sockets. 

## [[Evocations]] of Adorei

If the Solar who wields Adorei exults in battles, the blade offers +1 to [[Accuracy]] upon attunement. The weapon will form an instant Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of affection to a Solar who takes her out of the darkness of the tomb to carry her into battle. If the wielder uses her as their favored weapon, polishes her blade bright and acknowledges her as a companion, her bond will continue to grow until she has a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]]. At the Defining level, Adorei grants one automatic success to all withering damage rolls. At this level, Adorei automatically knows all of her wielder’s [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. Her Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] is predicated on being taken into battle and experiencing her wielder’s battle prowess, and being the medium through which it manifests. After three stories in which the [[Intimacy|Tie]] is Defining, Adorei will love her wielder forever and nothing can break or lower the [[Intimacy|Tie]], not even death. 

Adorei speaks in the mind of her wielder. She makes her will known through a language of strong emotions and instincts.
