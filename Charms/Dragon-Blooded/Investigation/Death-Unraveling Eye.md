*The ravages of decay and deterioration fall away from the Dragon-Blood’s perspective as she looks on the dead through eyes lit with Wood [[Essence]].*
She can examine a corpse that has been dead for no more than ([[Essence]] + [[Perception]]) years with a case scene roll, ignoring penalties from the decomposition of the corpse or any dismemberment inflicted on it. In addition to any information turned up by the case scene roll, the Dragon-Blood is capable of mentally rewinding the corpse’s decomposition, allowing her to view it as it was at the time of death and potentially identify him. She can analyze the state of the corpse’s injuries or diagnose any conditions present at the time of death with a ([[Perception]] + [[Medicine]]) roll, doubling 9s. Additionally, by viewing the entire process of the corpse’s decomposition in reverse, she automatically notices any conflicts with information she’s already turned up. For example, if a criminal hid a corpse in an ice chest to slow its rate of decay, the Dragon-Blood would be able to notice the slowed progress of deterioration and infer that the victim has been dead longer than he appears.
