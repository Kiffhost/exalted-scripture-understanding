When the sorcerer takes the first shape [[sorcery]] action to begin casting a spell and stunts it with a description of how she casts the spell through the talisman or draws on its power, she gains (stunt rating + 2) sorcerous motes towards completing this spell. This benefit can only be received once per scene. Stunts to enhance the sorcererâ€™s control spell do not count against the once per scene limit
