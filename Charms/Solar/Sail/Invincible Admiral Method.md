*The Solar is master of the sea and all that sail upon it.*
Her actions ignite fervor in her followers, impelling them toward emulation of her perfect form. Through use of mirrors, flags, and other signaling devices, the Exalt signals orders to ships in her fleet, preparing them for a series of naval maneuvers to combat their enemies. Roll the Lawgiver’s ({Charisma or Intelligence} + [[Sail]]); all allied ships that can see the Exalt’s orders add a number of dice to their naval maneuvers equal to half the successes, rounded up. This bonus also applies to the Solar’s own ship. While this Charm is active, the Solar must make this roll each round, renewing her orders to her fleet. Because of the mobile nature of combat, the same ships probably won’t always be able to see the Solar’s orders, and if the Exalt’s own ship falls under attack, she may be unable to signal for rounds at a time.
