*Offering philosophical guidance or spiritual insight, the Sidereal helps patients accept the frailties of flesh, facing such ailments with dignity and grace.*
The Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Medicine) against a living character to instill an Intimacy that supports accepting one’s mortality. (No roll is necessary if the target’s willing.) An affected character gains (Intimacy) soak, ignores the effects of disease, and ignores up to (Intimacy/2, rounded up) points of penalties from wounds, fatigue, poison, and crippling effects.
