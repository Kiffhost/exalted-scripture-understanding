The Immaculate delivers a rapid flurry of finishing blows, setting the air ablaze with her speed. She makes a decisive attack. As long as it deals any damage, it ignites a bonfire (Damage 4L/round, Difficulty 5) engulfing her victim, which burns without fuel for as long as he remains within it. Escaping the blaze requires him to disengage even if no combatants are in close range of him, in which case he rolls at difficulty 2.
