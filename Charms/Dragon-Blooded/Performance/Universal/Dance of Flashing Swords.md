*The Dragon-Blood can pass off a fight to the death as a piece of street theater.*
She makes a special instill roll with ([[Manipulation]] + [[Performance]]) against all bystanders to a combat or other violent altercation, explaining how it is actually an artistic performance. A character whose [[Resolve]] is beaten by this roll accepts the Dragon-Blood’s explanation of the scene’s events. He cannot spend [[Willpower]] to resist this influence unless the circumstances of the fight dramatically change in a way that undermines the Exalt’s lie, or if his ignorance would pose a threat to one of his Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. Unlike other Simple [[Charms]], [[Dance of Flashing Swords]] can be placed in a flurry.
