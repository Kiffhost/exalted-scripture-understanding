The verdicts passed on the wicked by Conquering Tide’s captain are as divine writ, a law beyond even those of Heaven and Hell. To use this Evocation, Hallowed Court of the Sea must be active, and the captain must witness a character truthfully confessing to an act that the captain considers a crime. The captain may use this Evocation to impose a geas on the confessing character, a task that he must complete to absolve himself of his crime. The difficulty of the task (Exalted, p. 216) she can command depends on the severity of the transgression: inconvenient tasks for crimes that oppose one of her Minor Intimacies or no Intimacy at all; serious tasks for crimes that oppose one of her Major Intimacies; and life-changing tasks for crimes that oppose one of her Defining Intimacies.
If misunderstanding or some other circumstance causes the captain to believe that the crime was more egregious than it actually was, then the Storyteller should mitigate the geas to the level of task appropriate for the actual act committed, rather than what the captain believes the act entailed, while preserving as much of the intent of the captain’s player as possible. Likewise, if the geas would constitute unacceptable influence (Exalted, p. 220), the Storyteller should mitigate it to render it acceptable while retaining as much of the geas’ intention as possible.
The geased character is treated as having a Defining Intimacy toward fulfilling the task, which can’t be weakened or altered. He need not spend his every waking hour devoted to his geas, but he must make a good faith effort toward making progress on it each day. He can spend one Willpower to suppress this Psyche effect for one scene.
Once he fulfills the geas, this Psyche effect ends.
This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by uncovering evidence of a crime that opposes one of the captain’s Defining Intimacies.
## Dissonant
Characters dissonant with Conquering Tide can’t awaken this Evocation.
## Resonant
The captain need not have a confession from her culprit to use this Evocation as long as she possesses overwhelmingly convincing evidence of his guilt (potentially including testimony from other characters). The culprit must still be present on Conquering Tide to be sentenced. If this evidence is inaccurate, the captain’s judgment is mitigated to a level appropriate to the culprit’s actual conduct, as above.
