*Death’s Lawgiver instills decay into the bones of an institution as she drains the life from it.*
The Abyssal can pay a five-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Shade-Summoning Conscription]] to reveal that she’s embedded a traitor, informer, or spy in a rival organization. Her double agent’s position is established by spending successes from her roll on dots of [[Backing]] and [[Influence]] for him, which cost only one success each.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, the Abyssal’s player can declare that an existing character has been her double agent, rather than recruiting a new character.
