The Lunar unleashes the primal rage howling in her soul, drawing terrifying power from fury. This Charm can only be used when she takes decisive damage. She enters a berserk rage, halving all wound and crippling penalties (round down), and gaining 1 [[Initiative]] whenever she suffers further decisive damage. Her rage doesn’t prevent tactical or intelligent decision-making, but she can’t withdraw, use social influence for purposes unrelated to combat, or cease fighting until all enemies are incapacitated or have fled. Ending this Charm prematurely crashes the Lunar, setting her to [[Initiative]] –3 (if not already lower). 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Berserker, the Lunar adds one die on all rolls with physical Attributes.
