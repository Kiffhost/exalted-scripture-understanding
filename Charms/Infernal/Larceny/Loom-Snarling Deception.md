*The Infernal’s shadow rises up to wreathe her in liquid darkness, melting away to reveal a new face and a false fate.*

The Infernal assumes a fictitious identity and a false destiny of her own imagining, instantly making a disguise roll. She needs no equipment, instead physically transforming her body. She can increase or reduce her height by up to ten inches; increase or decrease her weight by up to 10%; alter her apparent age; change or remove sexual characteristics; change skin tone, eye color, and hair color and length; and make cosmetic changes like adding scars or birthmarks. She may choose to retain physical alterations after this Charm ends.

The Infernal’s false destiny beguiles reality itself — she ceases to be an enemy of fate while disguised. Sidereal Charms or similar magic used to learn of her past, her future, or her place in fate reveal a result consistent with her fictitious identity. Such magic still provides accurate information to the extent that it doesn’t contradict the Infernal’s disguise. However, this can’t make it seem like she’s another type of Exalt or supernatural being.
## [[Keys]]
#### Clothed in Falsehood (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, any rolls to see through the Infernal’s disguise fail automatically unless enhanced by magic. Even then, opposing rolls suffer a penalty of (Infernal’s Manipulation). With Larceny 5, Essence 2, even characters using magic can’t make opposing rolls unless the Infernal acts blatantly out of character, and the penalty subtracts successes instead of dice.
#### Eldritch Secrets Mastery (Larceny 5, Essence 2)
The Infernal can alter the appearance of her anima banner and Caste Mark to imitate those of other types of Exalted as part of this disguise. She can also manifest supernatural sensory displays like the black oil that constantly drips down the demon Octavian (though not its poisonous qualities). Additionally, divinations used against her can now be twisted to make it seem as if she’s another type of Exalt or supernatural being.
