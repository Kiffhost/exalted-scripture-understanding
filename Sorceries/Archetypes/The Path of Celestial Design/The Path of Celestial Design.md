Sidereals trained in sorcery by the Bureau commonly seek initiation through the Path of the Celestial Design, a meditation upon the numinous pattern that undergirds the Celestial Bureaucracy. This pattern is the divine order by which the Celestial Bureaucracy binds Heaven to Creation and gods to their purviews, forged by the Ancients and reforged by the Incarnae. Through meditation upon it, sorcerers draw on Heaven’s power to work miracles of sorcery. This initiation is also common among gods who are sorcerers, as well as some elementals, Heaven’s Dragons, and others in the Celestial Bureaucracy’s employ.
