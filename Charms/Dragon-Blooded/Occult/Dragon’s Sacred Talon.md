When darkness gnaws at the roots of the world and chaos threatens the very balance of Creation, it’s the will of the Dragons that restores order. This Charm can supplement an attack made with any Ability, drawing upon the orderly [[Essence]] of Earth to strike down raksha and other creatures of the Wyld, or channeling vital Wood [[Essence]] to destroy one of the undead. A withering attack adds ([[Essence]]) dice to its damage after subtracting the target’s soak. A decisive attack deals aggravated damage and doubles 10s on the damage roll.
