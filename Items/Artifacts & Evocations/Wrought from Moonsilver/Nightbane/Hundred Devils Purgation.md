*The wielder’s arrows fall like shafts of moonlight, denying devils refuge in the darkness.*
Her attack against a fae or creature of darkness gains ([[Essence]]) dice of post-soak damage if withering, or adds ([[Essence]]) dice of damage and deals aggravated damage if decisive. Additionally, once the wielder awakens this Evocation, Nightbane’s attunement bonus applies on [[Awareness]] rolls to detect fae and creatures of darkness and [[Survival]] rolls to track them. 

## Resonant

The damage bonuses increase to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3).
