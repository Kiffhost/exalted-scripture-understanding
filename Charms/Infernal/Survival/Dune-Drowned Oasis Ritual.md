*The Infernal draws on the worship of her followers to poison the land’s heart, leading them in blasphemous chants and profane rites to raise a seat of hellish power.*

The Infernal creates a [[Demesne]] within a region desecrated by [[Holy Land Infliction]], leading a group of at least 100 worshippers in a ritual that takes five days. The desecration must have expanded at least one mile outward before she can do so, and the ritual must be performed at its centre. Once this is complete, a lesser Infernal [[Demesne]] forms with an aspect appropriate to the desecration’s nature forms (p. XX). If the Infernal has [[Cult]] 4+ and leads at least ten thousand followers, it’s a greater [[Demesne]].

As long as the [[Demesne]] remains, any desecrated land within (Essence x 10) miles can’t be cleansed by any means other than killing the Infernal. This only applies to the desecration surrounding the demesne and others that are contiguous with it.

The [[Demesne]] also empowers certain Infernal Charms within these desecrated lands:
- [[Hell-Walker Technique]]: While in Hell, the Infernal can use this Charm to travel to the desecrated land, bursting out of the sand gasping for air.
- [[Locust Manna Plague]]: The Infernal doubles her total successes on this Charm’s roll.
- [[Mad Prophet Sojourn]]: The Infernal doubles 9s on the roll. She adds ([[Cult]]) automatic successes on all rolls, not just those involving her [[Cult]] — though it’s a non-Charm bonus for such questions.
- [[Spawning Pit Sanctification]]: Spawning pits remain open indefinitely.

If the Infernal leads her worshippers in capping the [[Demesne]] with a [[Manse]] (Exalted, p. 243), she can use Survival in place of Craft (Geomancy), doesn’t need to spend any craft points, and divides the time needed to complete it by ([[Cult]]/2, rounded up).
