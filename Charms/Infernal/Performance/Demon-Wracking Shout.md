*A screaming wind pours from the Infernal’s mouth to terrify and torment demonkind, the echoed death cry of that which was once Adorjan’s heart.*

The Infernal rolls an undodgeable decisive attack with (Charisma + Performance) with (Essence) automatic successes against all demons within long range, as well as any other spirits that are creatures of darkness. This can affect dematerialized spirits. She makes a single damage roll against all enemies and adds ten dice of damage. The damage is aggravated.
