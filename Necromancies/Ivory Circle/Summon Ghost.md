*Under the veil of night, the necromancer calls forth one of the restless dead to bind them in her service.*
At night or in the Underworld, the necromancer performs an hour-long ritual to summon a human ghost of up to [[Essence]] 3. A black portal forms above the ritual site, drawing the summoned ghost through, accompanied by a wordless susurrus.
Ghosts summoned by this spell must be bound with an ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll against their [[Resolve]].
Ghosts with [[Essence]] 2+ or who are unusually potent — such as specters or sorcerers — gain +2 [[Resolve]] against this.
Success lets the necromancer impose a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to her for a year and a day that cannot be weakened or altered by any means. Alternatively, she may assign a task and a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] of “I must complete my task.” A ghost is bound by the letter of the necromancer’s commands rather than the spirit of them. If the necromancer fails, the ghost escapes back through the portal and cannot be bound for the rest of the story.
By default, the ghost is summoned from the Underworld; it’s a typical member of the “type” of undead to which it belongs (e.g., honored ancestor, mortwights, war ghosts). To summon specific ghosts, the necromancer must know a ghost’s name or identity and possesses a symbolic link to him such as a piece of his corpse, a treasured keepsake, or grave goods.
