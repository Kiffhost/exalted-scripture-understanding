Marking another with the distinctive sign of her divinity, the Lunar curses or blesses him to be mistaken for her. She must first touch her victim. In combat, this requires a difficulty 5 [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] gambit; outside of combat, she may accomplish this through social influence, trickery, or similar means. She then rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [Larceny, [[Occult]], or Presence]) opposing her victim’s ([Appearance, [[Stamina]], or Wits] + [[Integrity]]) roll. Success marks the victim with a physical characteristic almost identical to the Lunar’s [[Tell]] for (1 + Lunar’s extra successes) hours. The false [[Tell]] is obvious to all who perceive it, and imposes a −4 penalty on disguise rolls to conceal it. Onlookers must succeed on a difficulty 7 ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll to realize that the false [[Tell]] is not identical to the Lunar’s. Anyone that can see both the Lunar and her victim suffers a −2 penalty on rolls to spot the Lunar’s [[Tell]] or distinguish the false [[Tell]]. This mark doesn’t confer any benefits or disadvantages associated with the Lunar’s [[Tell]] — milky-blind eyes could still see normally, while mutations wouldn’t confer their benefits on the victim. This is a shaping effect (p. XX). With [[Manipulation]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Lunar may extend the false Tell’s duration from hours to days by committing this Charm’s mote cost for that duration.
