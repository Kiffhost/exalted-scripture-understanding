Over time, the Solar’s wisdom becomes the foundation of empires. Whenever students of the Solar — characters significantly educated or trained by the Solar — pass on her knowledge in turn, the act of following her teachings becomes a kind of worship. Conceptualizing the Solar’s teachings themselves as a character, for every dot of Followers her teachings might accrue, the Solar may count half those (rounded down, minimum one) as a dot of Cult.

### On Soul-Light Spreading Discipline

The backer requested a Lore Charm that would create a circular flow of benefit from the Solar teacher to their students, allowing the system to interpret the Solar’s students as her cult. A very cool concept indeed! In case you are wondering, for the hypothetical purposes of this Charm, Followers 4 reflects 1000+ followers, while Followers 5 reflects 5000+. Backer: Matt Rock
