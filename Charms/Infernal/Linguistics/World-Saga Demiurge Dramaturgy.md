*If reality is a text, then the Infernal is no passive reader. The world is hers to edit and revise.*

The Infernal transforms physical reality into a reified language in an aura that extends out to long range. This change isn’t harmful or incapacitating: people, things, and the even empty space dissolve into whispering glyphs that spell out their own identities and qualities, but remain animate and capable of physical interaction with other transmuted forms. The following effects apply within this aura:
- The Infernal defines a mood for the scene, choosing up to (Essence) Minor Intimacies to express it. All transformed characters count as having them. Actions that are supported by one of these Intimacies add a non-Charm success, while opposed actions suffer a one-success penalty.
- [[Spoken Sigil Ideogram]]’s effects apply to all speech within the aura, translating spoken sound into written glyphs.
- The Infernal can use ({Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation} + Linguistics) in place of any other dice pool, rewriting reality rather than acting upon it.
- The Infernal adds (higher of Essence or 3) automatic successes on influence rolls, and adds the same value to her Guile and Resolve.
- Enemies can’t spend Willpower to resist the Infernal’s Linguistics Charms unless they have a Defining Intimacy that’s opposed to the influence. Even then, it costs an additional Willpower to resist.
- Those outside this area can only affect those within, or vice versa, if it involves something physical that can pass in or out of this Charm’s area and be translated: a projectile, a shouted message, etc. This is subject to the rules above. Otherwise, interaction is impossible, though the Storyteller may allow stunts to bypass this.
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she enters her [[Devil-Body]].
