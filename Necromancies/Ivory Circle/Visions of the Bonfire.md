*The necromancer gazes into a blue-white bonfire to spy through the eyes of the restless dead.*
The necromancer tosses bone dust upon a flame in a ritual to scry on an undead character. He must have a Defining Tie of loyalty or obedience to her, unless she possesses a symbolic link to him, such as a piece of his corpse, a treasured keepsake, or a grave good. She rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) against the target’s [[Resolve]]; success allows the necromancer to reflexively perceive through the target’s eyes for the rest of the scene by peering into the fire, regardless of the distance between them. She may make [[Perception]] rolls and use magic to enhance them. While active, she can’t sense anything through her own body nor take actions with it, unless she chooses to end it prematurely. Taking damage automatically ends this spell.
While the necromancer spies, her target’s eyes glow with blue flames that betray her presence. Magic that exorcises possessing spirits can break this spell, otherwise the target must be destroyed to end it. If the target is part of a battle group, the [[Storyteller]] may treat him as an elected target (Exalted, p. 416) for directed attacks.
## Control
The necromancer can see through the senses of up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) targets, switching reflexively between them. To do so, her original roll must have beaten all targets’ [[Resolve]]. Alternatively, she may conceal her surveillance, muting the fire in her target’s eyes. A ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) roll at difficulty 3 is required to notice the subtle flames. The necromancer’s eyes glow with the bonfire’s blue flames.
## Distortion (7)
To distort this spell, the necromancer must be within short range of the target. Distortion renders the necromancer’s connection vulnerable to severance; any damage inflicted on the target is enough to end the effect.
