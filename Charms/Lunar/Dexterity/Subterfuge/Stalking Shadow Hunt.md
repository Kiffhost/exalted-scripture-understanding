The Lunar’s prey doesn’t see her as she hunts him, blind to the monster just behind him.
When someone the Lunar is pursuing or following makes a Perception roll against her, he must reroll a successful die for each 1, starting with 7s and moving up. If her pursuit is motivated by a Major or Defining Intimacy, his 2s force him to reroll successes as well.
Trivial characters fail automatically.
Once the Lunar’s pursuit concludes, this Charm lasts for one additional scene to resolve the consequences, then ends.

## Protean 
In animal shapes with the Ambush Hunter ability, opposing characters lose one Initiative for each die on their roll that’s rerolled into a 1 (or 2, if applicable).
