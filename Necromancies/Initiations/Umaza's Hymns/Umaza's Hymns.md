*The enigmatic Umaza wanders the Sea of Shadows, a leviathan of rotting flesh and grasping tendrils.*
She beaches herself upon the shore from time to time, revealing three mouths with which she sings bleak hymns in a glossolalia of prayerful regret. Those who learn her hymns are forever changed, minds blasted open to dark truths. Umaza infrequently visits [[Creation]] by night through mist-wreathed portals only she knows, luring unwary mortals to drown themselves for her sustenance or imparting her wisdom to the fortunate and willful.
