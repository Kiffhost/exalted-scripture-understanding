*The Dragon-Blood is a legendary swimmer, drawing on both her bodyâ€™s well-honed strength and unyielding endurance and on her affinity for the elemental flow of Water [[Essence]].*
She doubles 8s on movement rolls while swimming, and may ignore any penalties or difficult terrain from swimming against the current, through waves, across whirlpools, or through similar obstacles. She may even ascend waterfalls and similar vertical flows of water, though she treats these as difficult terrain. Any feats of strength the Dragon-Blood attempts while !!underwater,suchasdraggingthesurvivorsofashipwreck!! to safety or breaching the hull of an enemy warship, benefit from double 9s. She adds (Essence/2, rounded up) to her [[Strength]] to determine what feats she qualifies for.
