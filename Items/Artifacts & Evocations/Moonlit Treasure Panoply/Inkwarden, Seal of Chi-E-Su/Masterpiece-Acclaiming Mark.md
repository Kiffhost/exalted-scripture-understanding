This is the power for which Chi-E-Su was famed: to hear the story of something’s crafting, and bind that legend to its reality with the sanction of his seal.
This Evocation can be used when a suppliant comes before Inkwarden’s bearer with a mundane object that they’ve created, or that was created for them. The bearer must be told the object’s story to convince her it’s worthy of her blessing. The tale might tell of the skillful methods and wondrous materials used in its crafting, the heroic purpose for which it was forged, or the virtue and prowess of the one it was meant for. It doesn’t matter if any of this is actually true, so long as Inkwarden’s bearer believes it.
Telling the story is a special instill roll. The bearer can’t decline to assert her [[Resolve]] against it. The influence roll doesn’t have to be made by the suppliant — in ChiE-Su’s time, petitioners often hired poets and orators to speak on their behalf. The player should record the number of successes for this effect.
If Inkwarden’s bearer has firsthand knowledge of an object’s crafting, maker, or wielder, she can speak its legend herself if she believes the object worthy. She rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Performance]]) at difficulty 5. However, she can’t bless an object that she created.
On a successful roll, Inkwarden’s bearer may stamp the object, binding the legend to its reality. Anyone who encounters the object for the first time faces an instill action from it as they feel the weight of its legend.
This uses the successes from this Evocation’s initial roll. Alternatively, the bearer may specify a condition required to trigger this, like wielding a blessed weapon.
This influence instills a [[Intimacy|Principle]] of belief in the object’s story. For some, it’s as if they suddenly remembered a story they’d heard once, long ago; for others, the legend plays out in a hallucinatory break from reality.
This Evocation can be used multiple times to bless up to (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) objects.
## Resonant
Inkwarden adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) non-Charm dice on this Evocation’s initial roll.
