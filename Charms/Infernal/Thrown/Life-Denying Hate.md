*Fools think that life is hope. The Infernal proves otherwise.*

The Infernal makes a decisive attack, adding an automatic success and (target’s wound penalty x2) dice on the attack roll. She adds up to (Essence + target’s wound penalty) attack roll extra successes as dice of damage. If she has a negative Tie toward the target, she can use (Intimacy) in place of his wound penalty if it’s higher.

If the Infernal deals 3+ levels of damage, her target becomes incapable of healing damage by any means for the rest of the scene. Even after that, they’re incapable of healing levels of damage for the next (Infernal’s Essence) days, or (Essence + Intimacy) days if she has a negative Tie. Spirits incapacitated while subject to this are destroyed permanently.
