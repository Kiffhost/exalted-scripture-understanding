*The character harnesses the spirit of her throwing weapons, allowing her to strike a perfect blow at the moment of release.*
To use this Charm, the Solar must win [[Join Battle]] and make a decisive attack. Winning [[Join Battle]] means beating the roll results of all enemies present in the scene. [[Steel Storm Descending]] supplements this attack, granting a number of bonus dice equal to the difference between her [[Initiative]] and the [[Initiative]] of her target. At [[Thrown]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, this attack does not reset the Solar to base [[Initiative]].
