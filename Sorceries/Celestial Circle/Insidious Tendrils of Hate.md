For two hours, the sorcerer feeds her malice into a fire until it blazes green as Hell’s sun. At the ritual’s culmination, she casts a symbolic link to her intended victim into the flames: a piece of the target’s body — e.g., hair, nail clippings, blood — taken within the past three days, or something of personal significance to him. Upon completing the ritual, smoke envelops the target, seeping into skin and soul. The sorcerer rolls (Manipulation + Occult) against his Resolve and that of anyone within short range of him. This is an inspire roll to create hatred, but can’t be resisted with Willpower, and its effects last the spell’s duration. Victims become paranoid and hateful, perceiving insults in every word and assuming the worst of everyone. Their positive Major Ties count as Minor; positive Minor Ties are suppressed entirely. A sorcerer with this as her control spell exhales subtle wisps of acrid smoke when she exhales. She adds (Essence) dice on rolls to inspire hatred, including this spell’s roll, and on influence rolls leveraging hatred-based Intimacies. Distortion (Goal Number: 10): Distorting this curse on an individual lets him resist for one Willpower, though his positive Ties still remain diminished for the spell’s duration.
