For the duration of a crisis and its immediate aftermath — a war, a migration of refugees, a natural disaster — the Exalt waives the mote costs and silver point costs of [[Poppet-Knitting Practice]], [[Crack-Mending Technique]], [[Object-Strengthening Touch]], [[Wound-Mending Care Technique]], and [[Wound-Cleansing Meditation]] when using those [[Charms]] and [[Evocations]] to ameliorate the crisis. She cannot waive costs in concert with [[Craftsman Needs No Tools]]. At the end of the crisis, all fabric servants created at no cost disintegrate. This Evocation can only be activated once per story. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience points. It awakens at no cost when the wielder encounters a crisis that threatens a person, group, or place toward which she holds a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy]]. 

## Dissonant

Characters dissonant with moonsilver cannot awaken this Evocation.
