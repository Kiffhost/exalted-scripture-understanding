*With incredible deftness, the deathknight snatches death from the air and returns it to its rightful place.*
The Abyssal clashes a ranged attack by catching its projectile in a free hand, rolling a special ([[Dexterity]] + [[Thrown]]) decisive attack. If successful, she catches the incoming projectile and may reflexively ready it, but doesnâ€™t roll damage or reset her [[Initiative]].
With a [[Thrown]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to flings the weapon back at her attacker if she wins the clash, reflexively making a decisive attack that automatically hits and adds the extra level of damage from winning the clash. The Abyssal can retain any [[Charms]] or other effects used to enhance the original attack, but doing so prevents her from using her own magic to enhance it.
