*The Exalt raises the hammer high and brings it crashing down, causing a shockwave that makes the ground quake.*
Spending one or more charges, she rolls ([[Strength]] + [[Melee]]) against the ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) of all characters — friend or foe — within short range, adding one non-Charm bonus die per charge spent. Characters who fail the roll fall prone and lose one [[Initiative]] per spent charge, which the wielder doesn’t gain. 

## Resonant

The wielder can spend 3+ charges to extend the shockwave’s range to medium.
