Sensing a moment to strike, the Exalt orders her familiar in for the kill. Though it is a reflexive, this Charm supplements a familiar’s decisive attack, adding extra successes from the attack roll to the attack’s raw damage. Using this Charm sets the familiar’s [[Initiative]] to base after the attack, even when it’s under the effect of [[Deadly Predator Method]]. This Charm may not be used more than once per scene, but resets if the familiar raises its [[Initiative]] to 10+.
