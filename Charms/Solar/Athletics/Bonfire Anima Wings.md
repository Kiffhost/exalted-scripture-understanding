Relentless in pursuit of her ideals, the Lawgiver’s anima becomes like a pair of burning wings that carry her across the sky. When using Eagle-Wing Style to engage in aerial combat, and when her anima is at the bonfire level, the Solar’s attacks benefit from the effects of Onrush Burst Method, generating motes that can be used to pay the activation costs of Athletics Charms. When in use, the Solar’s anima typically resolves into wings that resemble an eagle’s or something else appropriate to the Solar’s iconic manifestation.
