Like day that turns to night, the Solar sinks into herself and becomes a perfect cipher. Once per story, the Solar may use this Charm to add her [[Resolve]] to her [[Guile]], or her [[Guile]] to her [[Resolve]]. While this Charm is active, exploiting her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] does not lower her [[Resolve]], nor may she call upon an [[Intimacy]] to raise her [[Resolve]].
