*The Sidereal hisses a long susurration in a spirit’s ear, whispering gibberish syllables in which the spirit nonetheless hears a secret about the future, one that it can never repeat.*
The Sidereal bestows a mysterious secret on a spirit, which becomes indebted to her. Fate reveals what he must do to repay her: The Storyteller chooses a task for the spirit that will be beneficial to the Sidereal or her interests, even if it’s not clear how at first.
The spirit must perform that favor as if convinced with a persuade roll that it can’t resist with Willpower. If a character makes an influence roll to convince the spirit to prioritize something else over completing the task, he must use the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p.
221). Earth elementals and other spirits associated with earth must make this task their foremost priority unless they enter a Decision Point, citing a Defining Intimacy to spend one Willpower.
The Sidereal doesn’t learn what the secret is, and the spirit is incapable of disclosing it to anyone in any fashion, treating all contrary influence as unacceptable.
Neither read intentions actions, mind-reading magic, nor any other similar effect can reveal the secret.
## Reset
Once per story, unless reset by upholding a Major or Defining Intimacy through revealing secrets or making calculated disclosures of information. Oracles can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
