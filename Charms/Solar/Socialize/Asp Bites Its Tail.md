*When the Solar’s name is impugned, she may turn those claims back on her accuser.*
When the Solar witnesses another character attempting a social action intended to harm the Solar’s reputation or convince others to take action against her, she may invoke this Charm, rolling ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Socialize]]). If this roll gains more successes than the aggressor’s, then the aggressor’s claim is turned back against himself. If he were using an instill action to convince someone that the Solar is untrustworthy, the target would be instilled with an [[Intimacy]] of distrust for him instead. If he were trying to persuade the prince to have the Exalt taken into custody, he himself would be arrested. This consequence always follows in a way that make sense in the context of the scene, i.e. the target’s accusations come off as suspicious, or he accidentally incriminates himself while trying to incriminate the Solar.
