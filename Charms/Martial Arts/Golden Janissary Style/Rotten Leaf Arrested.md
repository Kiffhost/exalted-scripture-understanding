*Let no unclean thing set foot over Creation’s threshold.* 
The stylist’s withering attack gains +1 Overwhelming and knocks her enemy prone if it deals damage. An enemy crashed by this attack cannot take a movement action on his next turn. 
Against creatures of darkness, the Overwhelming bonus rises to (Occult/2, rounded up), minimum +1, and she adds one automatic success to her withering damage roll. A creature of darkness crashed by the attack cannot move or attack on its next turn.
