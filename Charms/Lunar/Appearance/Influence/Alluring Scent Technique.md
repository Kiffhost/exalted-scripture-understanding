TheLunarexudesalluringpheromones,tantalizingthose around her. Characters of the same species as the Lunar’s current shape within short range (or further, depending on wind conditions) are affected based on what kind of Ties they have toward her (or her current form): No [[Intimacy|Tie]]: Affected characters without Ties toward the Lunar are fascinated and treated as though they had Minor Ties of curiosity toward her. Positive [[Intimacy|Tie]]: The Lunar may leverage the positive Ties of affected characters as though they had an emotional context of desire. Against characters of incompatible sexual orientation, she instead applies the “No [[Intimacy|Tie]]” effect. Negative [[Intimacy|Tie]]: Affected characters with negative Minor Ties can’t use them to increase [[Resolve]] or in Decision Points against the Lunar’s influence. Stronger negative Ties are unaffected.
