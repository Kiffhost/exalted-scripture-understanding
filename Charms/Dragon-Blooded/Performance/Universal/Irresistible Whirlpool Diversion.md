The Dragon-Blood’s performance draws in her audience’s attention like a maelstrom sucking in flotsam, making it difficult for them to pay attention to anything but her. She rolls ([Manipulation or Appearance] + Performance) with double 9s. Any audience members with a Resolve lower than her rolled successes suffers a penalty of (her Essence) to Awareness-based rolls to pay attention to anything or anyone other than her. The Dragon-Blood can take other actions while continuing the performance by flurrying them with a miscellaneous action to continue performing.
