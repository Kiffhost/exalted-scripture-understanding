The Solar’s keen understanding of an object allows her treat it with skill and [[Essence]], greatly increasing its durability. The Exalt may temper a blade, reinforce a door, or make a sail fireproof or nearly impenetrable to mundane attacks. She may make an inscription in marble that will not fade even after a hundred years of wind and rain. The Solar spends five minutes to an hour treating an object no larger than ([[Essence]]) yards in radius, increasing the difficulty to damage it by two or ([[Essence]]), whichever is larger. Objects which are fortuitously protected during the course of a scene, or which prove in some way to raise the Exalt’s social standing, accrue her a silver or gold point for basic or major objects, respectively, regardless of whether she built them or not. Durability conferred by this Charm is conferred permanently. The edges of blades strengthened by this technique do not dull after an entire day of hacking, and a reinforced helm may not shatter when struck by the blow of a mace.
