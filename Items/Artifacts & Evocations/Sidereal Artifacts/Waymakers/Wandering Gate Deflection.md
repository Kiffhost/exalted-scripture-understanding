*Countering an attack with her portals, the wielder redirects it where it can do no harm.* The wielder clashes an attack by an enemy at any range with a decisive (Wits + Martial Arts) attack. If successful, she doesnâ€™t roll damage or reset Initiative, but her attacker loses Initiative equal to the 1s on his attack. His attack is redirected through another portal against scenery or a trivial character chosen by the Storyteller, which suffers whatever harm the Storyteller deems appropriate. 
## Resonant
The wielder gains the lost Initiative.
