TheDragon-Bloodporesoverherblueprints,drawingthe lines up from the page with wisps of Air [[Essence]] into a shimmering three-dimensional mirage of anima. She can refine and perfect this ephemeral design with thought alone, her creativity unbounded by the material world’s limitations. This Charm can be used before beginning a major, superior, or legendary project. The Dragon-Blood must spend ten hours preparing the design in her workshop, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[Craft]]). The craft point cost to complete the project or roll an interval is reduced based on its tier and her rolled successes, as follows: Major: Rolling to complete the project costs (10 − successes) silver craft points, minimum one. Superior: Rolling an interval costs (10 − [successes/2, round down]) gold craft points, minimum one. Legendary: Rolling an interval costs (10 − [successes/4, round down]) white craft points, minimum one. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] by either completing a crafting project or giving or selling an object the Exalt has crafted to another character.
