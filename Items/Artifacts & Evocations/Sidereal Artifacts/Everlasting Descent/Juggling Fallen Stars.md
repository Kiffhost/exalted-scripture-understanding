*Everlasting Descent twists the trajectory of everything from arrows to meteors, sending them off-course in arcing parabolas.*
The wielder clashes a ranged attack with ([[Intelligence]] + [[Martial Arts]]), adding (Spin) bonus dice. Success lets her redirect the projectile, making an attack as with [[Errant Star Diversion]]. All magic used on the clashed attack applies its benefits to the wielder’s attack, if applicable. Alternatively, this Evocation can be used to defend the wielder against [[Uncountable Damage]], rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[Martial Arts]]) at difficulty 5. Success negates all damage, and renders the wielder immune to recurring sources of damage. Such force can’t be redirected at an enemy; it arcs away uncontrollaby but harmlessly. Once per story, the wielder can use this to protect everyone affected by a source of [[Uncountable Damage]], not just herself, with a difficulty 7 roll. While [[Whirling Ecliptic Barrier]] is active, its cover bonus is added as automatic successes on both the ([[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]]) roll and the wielder’s attack roll. 
## Dissonant
Making an attack after a successful clash counts as the wielder’s attack for the round.
