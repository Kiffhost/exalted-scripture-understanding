Once the Tusk tastes combat with a monster, it hungers for blood, unwilling to end the chase until the beast lies dead. This Evocation supplements a piercing attack (Exalted, p. 586), waiving the [[Initiative]] cost to make it and allowing the Tusk to pierce the natural soak of behemoths, animals with thick hides, and similar foes. Against the Tuskâ€™s quarry, the wielder adds ([[Strength]]) to the amount of soak the attack ignores. 

## Resonant

This Evocation also waives the [[Defense]] penalty for making a piercing attack.
