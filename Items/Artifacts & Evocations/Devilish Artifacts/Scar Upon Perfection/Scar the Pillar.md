*The Scar’s caustic edge cuts through stone as easily as through skin.*

The wielder makes a feat of demolition using the Scar’s edge, reducing its difficulty and minimum Strength by 1. The reduction increases to two against objects made to be decorative or exceptionally beautiful. Once per day, successfully destroying a thing of beauty grants the wielder one Willpower.
