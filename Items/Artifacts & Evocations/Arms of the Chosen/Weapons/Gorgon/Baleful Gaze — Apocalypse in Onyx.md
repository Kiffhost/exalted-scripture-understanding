## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by a wielder resonant with [[Gorgon]]. While the Exalt is at 15+ [[Initiative]] and has activated Unblinking Eye of Nightmare, she unleashes the full rancor of the devil in the sword. For the rest of the scene, Gorgon’s Wakefulness cannot diminish, while the towering Eye continues to loom regardless of the Exalt’s anima level, its gaze a palpable force that petrifies with but a passing glance. The Exalt may make ranged [[Melee]] attacks through the eye out to extreme range, extends the range of The Dead Eye Opens to extreme, and waives the cost of [[Stone-Sinew Offensive]] and [[Granite Venom Strike]] for the rest of the scene. Whenever the wielder makes a ranged [[Melee]] attack, she petrifies all trivial opponents, battle groups without [[Might]] whose members individually would be trivial opponents, and nonmagical inanimate objects within medium range of the target. This turns rain to pebbles, snow to volcanic ash, clouds and fog to dust, rivers to sand, and soil to stone right down to the bedrock. At the Storyteller’s discretion, a dramatic and narratively meaningful botch while this Evocation is active may break the bonds restraining the devil in the sword, unleashing it upon the world. This Evocation can only be activated once per story. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation.
