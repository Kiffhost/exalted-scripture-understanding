*Caged within a tomb of iron, the Abyssal finds no freedom, even in death itself.*
The Abyssal rolls her armor’s soak and adds it to her Hardness against a decisive attack. If the attack overcomes her Hardness, each success on her roll subtracts one success from the damage roll.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can perfectly defend against uncountable damage. Against recurring sources, the Abyssal becomes immune for the rest of the scene. If she’s wearing mundane armor, it’s destroyed once the uncountable damage subsides.
This Charm is incompatible with Wounds Mean Nothing.
