*Drawing on the Spear’s sway over the fortunes of gamblers and her own superlative skill, the Sidereal triumphs over risk and long odds.*
Successfully blocking an attack grants the Sidereal one mote plus an additional mote for each success her attacker failed by, maximum ([[Perception]]). The Sidereal must pay one [[Initiative]] at the start of each round or this Charm ends. It also ends if she’s crashed.
