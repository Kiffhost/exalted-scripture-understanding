The Hungering Fangs claim their quarries’ secrets, unveiling the intrigues of faerie princes and wresting forbidden knowledge away from its keepers.
When the wielder uses [[Lessons of the Hunt]], she learns one of her enemy’s secrets — whichever one is most advantageous for her to learn in that moment, or that enemy’s greatest secret if none are immediately advantageous.
Awakening: This Evocation can’t be purchased with experience points. Instead, it awakens for free when the wielder incapacitates an enemy who knows a secret that could be disadvantageous to her or a threat to one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. She may then use [[Lessons of the Hunt]] against him.
