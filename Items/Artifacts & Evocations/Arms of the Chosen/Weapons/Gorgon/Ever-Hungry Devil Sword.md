As Gorgon sheds its lassitude to feed, it drags its wielder from one victim to the next. Whenever the Exalt kills an opponent with a decisive attack, she may activate this Evocation to add Gorgon’s Wakefulness (including any increase from the attack) to her Initiative after resetting to base Initiative. This doesn’t stack with other effects that increase base Initiative.
