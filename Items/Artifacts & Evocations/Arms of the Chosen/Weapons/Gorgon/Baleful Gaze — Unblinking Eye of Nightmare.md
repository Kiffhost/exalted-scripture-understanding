## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by a wielder resonant with [[Gorgon]]. When the eye on Gorgon’s blade is fully open, if the Exalt’s anima is at bonfire she may manifest Gorgon’s eye therein like the looming oculus of some demon prince. Enemies recoil before its gaze; the Exalt adds one automatic nonCharm success to her threaten actions. Enemy battle groups suffer a −1 penalty to rally for numbers actions and raise the difficulty of rout and rally rolls by 1. As long as the Exalt’s anima remains at bonfire, she may employ The Dead Eye Opens out to long range, and may flurry maintaining the paralysis with other combat actions. Granite Venom Strike’s damage increases to (Essence/2, round up)L/round against an enemy thus paralyzed. If the Exalt’s anima dims below bonfire or Gorgon’s eye becomeslessthanfullyopen,theeffectsofUnblinkingEye of Nightmare cease, only to return in full force when both anima and eye return to maximum.
