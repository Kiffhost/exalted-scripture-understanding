The necromancer has gained initiation through ritual sojourns along the primal River of Blood and its forty-four daughter-streams which drain into [[shadowlands]] across [[Creation]]. These holy waterways are guarded by saints who instruct postulants in the mysteries of blood as nourishment and sacrament. This order counts many exiled gondoliers among its number, shepherding the dead towards wisdom and [[sacrifice]]. Necromancers who walk this path find themselves marked as holy personages by the faithful of the Incarnadine Path (p. XX).
