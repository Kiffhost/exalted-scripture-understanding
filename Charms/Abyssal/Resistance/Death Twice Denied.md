*Through the Bleak Exaltation, Death’s Lawgiver once denied death — she does so again with naught but raw endurance.*
Against a withering attack, the Abyssal can use this Charm for two motes to soak unsoakable damage with her base [[Stamina]], not including armor or any other soak bonuses.
Against a decisive attack, the Abyssal can use this Charm for six motes after the damage roll to gain ([[Stamina]]) temporary −0 health levels indefinitely. Unlike most temporary health levels, they don’t vanish when damaged. Once the scene ends, they become −1 health levels, vanishing only when the damage is healed. Healing applies to them before the Abyssal’s normal health levels. If she engages in vigorous activity like combat while she still has damaged levels remaining, their wound penalty increases by −1 each day. She can’t voluntarily end the Charm until all temporary levels have been healed.
With [[Resistance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, this Charm’s cost is reduced to five motes against decisive attacks. The Abyssal can gain up to ([[Essence]]) additional temporary levels, committing an additional mote per level.
