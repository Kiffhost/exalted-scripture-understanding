*In the libraries of ancient necropolises, the dreams of dying titans, and texts forbidden by fearful monks, the deathknight uncovers disturbing insights.*
After a scene spent poring over moldering scrolls, conducting strange experiments, divining omens from entrails, or the like, the deathknight rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]), banking insight points equal to her successes. She may spend insight points on the following effects reflexively:
1 point: Reset the once-per-scene limit on [[introducing a fact]].
3 points: Add (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) necromantic motes toward shaping a spell. The Abyssal may use this benefit multiple times on the same spell.
3 points: Retroactively reveal a codex, scroll, or the like on the deathknight’s person that’s exceptional equipment for [[Lore]] or [[Occult]] rolls concerning a specific topic, comparable in breadth to a specialty.
5 points: Add (Essence/2, rounded up) successes on [[Investigation]], [[Lore]], [[Medicine]], and [[Occult]] rolls for one scene.
5 points: Automatically succeed on a roll to introduce or [[Challenging a Fact|challenge a fact]] involving a topic that [[Waking Nightmare Inspiration]] could grant a specialty in, as long as the [[Storyteller]] deems success possible.
5 points: Add one [[Willpower]] toward the cost of a [[Lore]] Charm or spell.
5 points: Gain +2 [[Resolve]] for one scene.
7 points: Automatically succeed on a roll to introduce or challenge any fact, as long as the [[Storyteller]] deems success possible.
7 points: Use [[Night-Horror Summons]] retroactively, revealing that the Abyssal’s nightmare is present somewhere in the scene.
The Abyssal must know any [[Charms]] enhanced with insight points.
