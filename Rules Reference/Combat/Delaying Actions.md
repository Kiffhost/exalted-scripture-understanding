A character may delay his turn, waiting until a point later than his [[Initiative]] to act, if he desires. The delayed action may be deployed on any [[Time#tick|tick]] later in the [[Time#Round|round]] that the player wishes. This is an excellent way to force [[Clash]] Attacks, for characters who know powerful [[Clash]]-enhancing [[Charms]]. 

However, delaying an action costs 2 [[Initiative]].
