*Slamming a fist or heel into the ground, the Dragon-Blood drives a pulse of pyroclastic [[Essence]] into the earth beneath her, forcing a surge of molten lava forth from the depths.*
To use this Charm, she must have [[Initiative]] 20+ and be standing on bare soil or stone. This eruption is represented as an unblockable decisive attack against all characters, friend or foe, within medium range, with the Dragon-Blood applying a single attack roll against all of them. She may exempt her Hearthmates from the attack.
The Dragon-Blood divides (her [[Initiative]] + the lowest number of attack roll extra successes she received against any hit target) evenly, rounded down, among all hit characters to determine the lethal damage the lava rolls against them. Trivial opponents are incapacitated automatically without detracting from the Dragon-Blood’s total damage, and scenery is damaged at the Storyteller’s discretion.
If a crashed enemy takes 3+ levels of damage, the eruption leaves a lava hazard (difficulty 5, damage 6L/round) on the ground beneath him. These hazards cool and solidify into obsidian when the scene ends; characters might cool or disperse them earlier with clever stunts or magic.
This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset by gaining 20+ [[Initiative]] from a single withering attack made from base [[Initiative]], and then incapacitating that enemy on the next turn with a decisive attack.
