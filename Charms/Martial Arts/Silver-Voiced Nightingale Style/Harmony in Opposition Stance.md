Acting with preternatural timing and the grace of a trained dancer, the Nightingale moves in perfect counterpoint to an enemy, mimicking the rhythm of his movements and predicting his every attack. When the martial artist uses Harmony in Opposition Stance, she chooses a single enemy to synchronize her movements with. She may always apply her full Evasion against attacks made by the chosen enemy, ignoring all penalties, and applies double 9s on rolls to rush him or disengage from him. Finally, whenever the chosen enemy gains Initiative, the martial artist gains a single point of Initiative, unless he gained that Initiative by attacking her. The martial artist may choose to synchronize her movements to those of a different enemy as a miscellaneous action, which cannot be placed in a flurry. If she incapacitates the enemy she is synchronized with, or causes him to flee, surrender, or otherwise become removed from combat through influence rolls, then she may reflexively designate a new enemy. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood must activate this as a Simple Charm. Successfully defending against an attack made by an enemy whose intentions she has successfully read this scene or in the preceding one gives her an opportunity to activate it reflexively against that attacker. The Essence minimum of this Charm becomes 3 for Dragon-Blooded.
