*The Infernal’s body is warped with inhuman strength, swollen with overlarge muscle.*

The Infernal adds (Essence + 1) dice on feats of strength and (Essence + 1) to her effective Strength to determine what feats she can accomplish.

An Infernal with this Charm grows larger in stature: enough to be remarkable, but still within ordinary human limits, imposing a −2 penalty on most disguise rolls.
## [[Keys]]
#### Strength is Destruction
On feats of demolition, the Infernal adds +2 to the dice bonus and Strength bonus.
#### Unfaltering Exertion Triumph (Athletics 5) (3m)
The Infernal can pay three motes to double this Charm’s Strength bonus for a single feat. This includes bonuses from other keys.
#### Behemoth-Sinew Surge (Athletics 5, Essence 3; [[#Unfaltering Exertion Triumph (Athletics 5) (3m)|Unfaltering Exertion Triumph]])
The Infernal can pay five motes to double this Charm’s dice bonus for a single feat and add (Essence + 1) to her dice limit for the roll. Doing so waives [[#Unfaltering Exertion Triumph (Athletics 5) (3m)|Unfaltering Exertion Triumph’s]] cost for that feat.
#### World-Shaking Might (Athletics 5, Essence 4, [[#Behemoth-Sinew Surge (Athletics 5, Essence 3; Unfaltering Exertion Triumph (Athletics 5) (3m) Unfaltering Exertion Triumph)|Behemoth-Sinew Surge]])
The Infernal adds +2 to this Charm’s dice bonus and Strength bonus.
