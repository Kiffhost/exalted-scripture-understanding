The Dragon-Blood consigns an artifact Melee weapon to the elements, banishing it Elsewhere through a dramatic and significant manifestation of an element that is at least as large as her weapon. Her daiklave might become translucent and fluid as she touches it to the surface of a lake, dissolving into the body of water; a direlance plunged into a boulder or stone wall might vanish into it; a goremaul fades away as a strong gust of wind carries it away. She may alternatively recall it from a similar manifestation of the same element. If the Exalt doesnâ€™t have access to an appropriate elemental manifestation, she may expend a level of anima to banish or recall her weapon. Once banished this way, it may be recalled through a manifestation of her Aspect element.
