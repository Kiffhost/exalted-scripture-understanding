Uncharted lands and perilous seas yield their secrets to the wayfaring Lunar. She spends a scene plotting a course and rolls (Wits + Survival) with (higher of Essence or 3) bonus dice and double 9s, banking all successes. She may add up to (Essence) banked successes as non-Charm successes on Survival rolls to forage or find shelter along the journey, or Sail rolls to navigate hazards at sea. This Charm can only be used once per journey. It ends once all banked successes are spent. A Wits 5 repurchase doubles 8s on this Charmâ€™s roll, and lets the Lunar use it instantly, without needing to plot a course; the banked successes, and any Charms enhancing Lodestone Reckoning Manner, are available to her whenever she travels. She can only do so once per day. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is migratory can learn this as a Perception Charm.
