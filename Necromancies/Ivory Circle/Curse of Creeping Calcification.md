*The necromancer exhales a wisp of undulating white dust that darts forth to infect her victim, slowly transforming his flesh to ivory.*
The necromancer rolls (Intelligence + Occult) against a target within short range as a special, unblockable decisive attack that doesn’t deal damage or reset her Initiative. Success infects her target with the supernatural disease known as ivory flesh affliction. It has virulence (necromancer’s Intelligence), morbidity (Essence + 2), and a one-day interval. Mundane medical treatment is useless. The necromancer’s victim doesn’t receive a roll against the disease’s virulence unless he uses magic that specifically defends against disease.
### Minor Symptom
The victim’s flesh is partially transformed to ivory, inflicting a −1 mobility penalty.
### Major Symptom
The mobility penalty increases to −3 as the transformation spreads.
### Defining Symptom
The mobility penalty subtracts successes rather than dice and causes the victim to treat all movement as if through difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199).
### Death
Mortals die, transformed entirely into ivory, while others are rendered immobile, able to move nothing but their eyes. Spirits can be freed by destroying their calcified form, letting them reform as usual.
This spell can be used on dematerialized characters, forcibly materializing them upon infection and preventing them from dematerializing while they’re afflicted.
If their Essence is greater than the necromancer’s, they may pay one Willpower to ignore this for one scene.
## Control
The sorcerer grows patches of scaly bone across her body, granting her one dot of the Unusual Hide Merit (Exalted, p. 166). She can slow the curse’s interval to weeks, months, or even years and may touch a character to relieve them of its effects for a period she chooses, after which the symptoms come back in full.
This cannot revive those who’ve died to the spell.
## Distortion (10)
The target reduces the mobility penalty by one and can’t reach the death stage of the disease’s progression. The distorting spellcaster may use Occult instead of Medicine to treat the disease.
