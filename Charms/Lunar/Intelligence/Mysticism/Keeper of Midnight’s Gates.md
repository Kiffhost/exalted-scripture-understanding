*Reality’s secret veils open and close at the Lunar’s whim, that she might beckon forth ethereal allies or chastise unruly spirits.*
She rolls ([[Intelligence]] + {Lore, [[Occult]], or Presence}) against the ([[Essence]] + 2) of a dematerialized spirit she can perceive within medium range. If successful, the spirit materializes without paying the usual cost. The Lunar may strip the spirit of its ability to dematerialize for (her [[Essence]]) rounds. Spirits may pay one [[Willpower]] to remain dematerialized if their [[Essence]] exceeds the Lunar’s, or if they have an applicable Defining [[Intimacy]].
