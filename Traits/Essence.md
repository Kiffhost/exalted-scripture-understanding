Exaltation instills a mortal soul with the power of the gods, opening the recipient’s eyes to the energies within. This [[Essence]] grants an Exalt power, and as the Chosen grow in power and enlightenment, so too does the [[Essence]] within them. As they perfect and purify their inner might, they can accomplish ever greater feats. Your character’s [[Essence]] rating represents both the cultivation of her [[Essence]], and her overall level of Exalted prowess. All Exalted begin with an [[Essence]] rating of one dot. **Essence rating is one of two main prerequisites for your character’s Charms—as her [[Essence]] rating increases, she can purchase more powerful [[Charms]].** Additionally, [[Essence]] rating helps determine the capacity of her [[Essence]] pools. 

# Mote Pools 

[[Essence]] is the fuel of the Exalted, transforming heroic feats into divine miracles—but even the Chosen are limited by the amount of power that a human frame can contain. Savants recognize that an Exalt can channel only a limited amount of [[Essence]] without causing friction between himself and the world around him. When an Exalt calls upon his [[Essence]], it escapes from him—and if it is drawn too rapidly, it passes through his anima, causing a brilliant display.

Your character’s surface [[Essence]] is known as his *peripheral mote pool*, while the [[Essence]] residing in the depths of his spirit is called the *personal mote pool*. Both pools contain a reserve of motes, which power [[Charms]]. It’s helpful to have a piece of paper or two handfuls of differently-colored beads or poker chips to help you keep track of how many motes you have remaining. **When your character activates a Charm or other power, you may spend from either pool, but you can only split the cost between them if you don’t have enough motes in your chosen pool to pay the full cost.** Spending peripheral motes might cause your anima banner to flare (see below). 

Mote pools replenish themselves over time. **Characters with mote pools regain five motes of [[Essence]] at the end of each round while in combat**, as the dynamism of battle stirs the world around them. **Outside of battle, characters regain five motes per hour.** In the most relaxed of times—such as when a character is asleep, meditating, or quietly reading—they respire [[Essence]] at a rate of 10 motes per hour. Motes in the peripheral pool are replenished before motes in the personal pool. 

A Solar’s personal mote pool is ({Essence x 3} + 10) motes, while her peripheral mote pool holds ({Essence x 7} + 26) motes.
