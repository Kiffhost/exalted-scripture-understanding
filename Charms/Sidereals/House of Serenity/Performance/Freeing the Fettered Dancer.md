*In failure, there is freedom, even from the worst of woes.*
When the Sidereal observes a character fail a roll or suffer a setback, she rolls (Charisma + Performance) to free him from a Psyche effect. The roll’s difficulty is the (Essence + 3) of the character who used that effect. If she fails, she can’t reuse this Charm on that affliction.
