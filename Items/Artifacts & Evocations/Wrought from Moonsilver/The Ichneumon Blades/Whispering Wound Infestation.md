*The Ichneumon Blades’ shards whisper to their hosts at night, poisoning their dreams.*
The wielder rolls ([[Manipulation]] + {Occult or Presence}) against the [[Resolve]] of a character whose general location she knows with at least one embedded splinter. Success afflicts him with a [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 168) of her choice at Minor intensity. Its intensity fluctuates with his current number of splinters, rising to Major if he has 3+ splinters, or Defining with 5+. Removing splinters can lower the [[Derangement]]’s intensity. Once all are removed, the [[Derangement]] lingers at Minor intensity until the story’s end, when it fades altogether. Derangements inflicted by this Evocation stir to life in the Ichneumon Blades’ presence. Upon joining battle against the wielder, the victim must roll [[Willpower]] against the [[Derangement]]. Failure causes him to lose (intensity) [[Initiative]], which she doesn’t gain. This Evocation can’t be used against the same character more than once per story. 

## Resonant

Successfully afflicting a [[Derangement]] on a nontrivial character grants the wielder one [[Willpower]].
