Twisting her joints in directions they shouldn’t twist or budding off prehensile tendrils, the Lunar wrests away her enemy’s weapon. She imposes a −1 penalty on an enemy’s Defense against a disarm gambit, and adds attack roll extra successes as bonus dice on the gambit’s Initiative roll. 
## Protean 

If the Lunar attacks with an animal form’s tail, tentacles, or similar flexible appendages, she may fling a disarmed weapon out to medium range from its wielder with 3+ extra successes on the Initiative roll.
