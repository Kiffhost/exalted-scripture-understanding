Cool black fire blossoms from Asphodel to engulf the Exalt, along with any number of other willing characters in close range. Vanishing, they reappear in the world hidden in the jewel. [[Asphodel]] accompanies the wielder, nestling inside itself.
*This is a lifeless realm, lovely and cold; a place of nacreous mists and quicksilver pools, of vertiginous promontories and crystalline spires. At its heart rises Shou Ren’s onyx and silver palace, where he rules in ennui over hundreds of ghosts drawn into his realm over the millennia. The hidden world provides a place for rest and recovery; for study with the prince in the jewel and his ghostly advisors; and for artifice and sorcerous workings amid wondrous libraries and laboratories.*
It is secure against mundane intrusion but can be entered for this Evocation’s duration as though it were a spirit sanctum by dematerialized characters or characters using sanctum-opening magic to pursue the Exalt and her companions between worlds. When the Exalt wishes to depart, she and her companions reappear the next midnight at the same spot where they entered. 
[[Enter the Hidden World]] may not be used in combat. 
## Resonant
