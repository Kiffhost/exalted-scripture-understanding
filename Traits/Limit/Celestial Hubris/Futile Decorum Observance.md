The Sidereal fixates on etiquette, decorum, consensus-building, and proper bureaucratic procedure to the expense of all else, unwilling to compromise the most trivial rules no matter how urgent the peril she faces or how great an advantage she concedes. If a problem can be addressed through political or bureaucratic action, she’ll prioritize that method. When making decisions or plans, she’ll go to great lengths to ensure that all involved can agree to it, even if she has unilateral decision-making authority.
This ends if the Sidereal’s inaction or delay causes someone or something for which she has a positive Major or Defining Tie to come to harm.
