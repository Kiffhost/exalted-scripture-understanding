Doom of Tamokhet, a supernatural disease that infects a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] to an individual (see [[Sting of Betrayal]]). It has virulence and morbidity (6 − [[Intimacy]]) and an interval of one week. The Doom is a Psyche effect as well as a disease; rolls against it use ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) instead of ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). Medical diagnosis and treatment are useless unless enhanced by magic.
# Minor
The victim’s relationship is infected with irrational mistrust. Voluntarily strengthening the [[Intimacy|Tie]] costs one [[Willpower]]. 
# Major
The victim obsesses over the possibility of being betrayed by the [[Intimacy|Tie]]’s object. As above, and when he tries to use the infected [[Intimacy|Tie]] against social influence or for another purpose, the Storyteller can deny it unless he pays one [[Willpower]] to do so. Otherwise, he must use a different [[Intimacy]]. This counts as a botch inflicted by the disease (Exalted, p. 234). 
# Defining
The victim is certain the [[Intimacy|Tie]]’s object plots his downfall. As above, but the [[Intimacy|Tie]] is suppressed completely. Instead of preventing the victim from using the [[Intimacy|Tie]], the Storyteller can prevent him from taking any action that would align with the suppressed [[Intimacy|Tie]]. Doing so requires entering a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and citing a Defining [[Intimacy]]. 
# Death
The Doom’s symptoms never result in death — at least, not directly. Repeat exposures to the Doom can infect multiple Ties, but this is still treated as a single disease, using the same intensity for all infected [[Intimacy|Intimacies]].
