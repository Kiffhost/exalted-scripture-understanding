*The Ravenous Throne’s countless legs find purchase wherever they go.*
The throne’s master adds ([[Essence]]) dice on a mounted movement action, or ([[Essence]])successes on rolls involving climbing or balance. The war-throne can climb up sheer surfaces and under horizontal ones, though doing so counts as difficult terrain and its master must continue using this Evocation each turn or risk falling.
If the throne’s rider knows [[Crouching Gargoyle Stance]] (p. XX) or similar magic that lets her move up walls, this Evocation’s cost is reduced by two motes.
