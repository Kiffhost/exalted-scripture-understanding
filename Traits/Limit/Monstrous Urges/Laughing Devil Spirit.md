The Lunar destroys illusions of stability and security, a trickster-mentor revealing harsh truths. She conveys these lessons by intervening in Storyteller characters’ lives to sow discord, create problems, and incite chaos.
If she has multiple potential victims, she’ll begin with those whose power or privilege afford them the greatest safety or stability — wealthy merchants, mighty warriors, and powerful sorcerers are more satisfying to humble than impoverished peasants or slave laborers.
This ends if the Lunar’s interventions inadvertently create a significant obstacle to her or her Circle’s goals.
