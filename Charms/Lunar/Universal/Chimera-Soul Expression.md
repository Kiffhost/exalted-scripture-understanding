*The Lunar’s true self transcends definition, manifesting as a chimerical combination of beasts.*
She permanently enhances her spirit shape with aspects of a second animal, applying six dots of mutations based on that animal, which count toward determining what Protean Charm benefits her spirit shape receives. These mutations also automatically apply when she uses [[Hybrid Body Transformation]]. The Lunar treats both animals as her spirit shape for Totemic [[Charms]].
