*Having worn down her foes with an unrelenting offensive, the Dragon-Blood finds their feeble strikes all too easy to overpower.*
When she clashes an attack, her enemy’s attack roll loses dice equal to the onslaught penalty that wore off at the start of his turn (or his current onslaught penalty, if he’s attacking outside of his turn or if his onslaught penalty didn't refresh at the start of his turn due to other effects).
