An ever-cunning hunter, the Lunar ensures she never fights on a level playing field. She reveals that an enemy has fallen into a trap she’s previously constructed. If circumstances render this implausible — for instance, because the Lunar is being ambushed on unfamiliar ground — the Storyteller may require a stunt to explain how she devised the trap so quickly. This is an unblockable, undodgeable grapple gambit at difficulty 4 against an enemy within medium range. The Lunar makes a single (Wits + [Survival or an applicable Craft]) roll as both the attack roll and the grapple’s control roll. Her victim opposes the control roll with a (Perception + Awareness) or (Dexterity + Dodge) roll. If the attack is unexpected, the enemy suffers a penalty on this opposed roll equal to the Lunar’s Initiative roll extra successes, and it doesn’t break concealment. This isn’t compatible with Strength Charms, Martial Arts Charms, or other non-Wits magic that enhances grapples. If successful, the trap establishes a clinch (Exalted, p. 200). The Lunar can’t take the usual special grapple actions, but doesn’t suffer any penalties. A trapped character can spend his entire turn to reduce the clinch’s rounds of control by two. Likewise, a character that spends her entire turn assisting the victim subtracts two rounds of control. Attacking or damaging the Lunar doesn’t subtract rounds of control. If the Lunar has a relevant Craft, a successful clinch grants three silver points. If a nontrivial opponent is incapacitated or surrenders while trapped, she also gains (his Essence) gold points. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack from Initiative 15+ that resets the Lunar’s Initiative, or successfully establishing concealment against all enemies with a Stealth roll. A Wits 5 repurchase lets the Lunar raise the gambit’s difficulty to combine it with the effect of a disarm, distract (transferring five Initiative), or unhorse gambit, as long as she establishes at least one round of clinch control.
