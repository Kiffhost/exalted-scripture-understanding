*Shattering the boundaries that keep her from someone’s soul, the Sidereal rescues him from spiritual turmoil.*
The Sidereal enters the mindscape of a willing, unconscious, or restrained target, allowing her to interact with his mind or soul. This can’t be used to influence others — it’s limited to observation, healing or mitigating maladies, and esoteric interactions that aren’t otherwise possible. The Sidereal rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Presence]]) against a difficulty or opposing roll appropriate to the specific effect. Examples include: 
- Roll against a target’s [[Guile]] to sift through his memories, seeking a specific piece of information or to look for signs of spiritual or mental maladies, like possession. She may suffer a penalty if the memories she seeks out are old or somehow obscured. She can make Perceptionbased rolls and use [[Charms]] to examine these memories for information her target missed. 
- Weaken or subvert the control exerted by a Psyche effect, rolling against an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll by the character responsible. The Sidereal’s player should work out the specifics with the Storyteller, but they should involve altering how it affects the target, rather than reducing [[Willpower]] costs, mitigating penalties, or other mechanical effects. 
- Roll against a Fair Folk’s [[Resolve]] to enter its spiritual maw and wrest free the shards of someone’s psyche that it’s devoured. A subsequent use of this Charm can return them to that character, rolling against a difficulty based on how it’s been since the raksha fed on him.
