The Sidereal reveals hidden strands of green phosphorescence twined around her fingers, weaving her surroundings into fate. The Sidereal and everything within short range of her are immune to the effects of Wyld exposure. The environment within that area follows Creation’s physical laws. If the Sidereal renews this Charm when its duration ends, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost. Wyld Exposure Resisting exposure to the Wyld is a ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) roll; failure results in unwanted transformation that count as [[Flaws]] (Exalted, p. 167), addiction, or Derangements. The difficulty, consequences for failure, and frequency at which the roll must be made depend on the Wyld’s intensity. Certain ritual practices, meditative disciplines, and warding talismans may add bonus dice; accepting faerie hospitality may impose penalties. Once a character fails a roll against exposure, she doesn’t need to make rolls for that specific location again for the rest of the story. Different Wyld locales have their own distinctive character. The mutations they inflict reflect this: a glacial ziggurat transforms people into living ice; a subterranean labyrinth twists those who pass through it into pale, elongated creatures; a forest of speaking beasts traps humans in animalistic forms. BEGIN TABLE Intensity Difficulty Interval Possible Effects Bordermarch 3 Monthly [[Addiction]]. Largely superficial transformations. No Derangements. Middlemarch 5 Weekly [[Addiction]]. Minor Derangements. Undesirable tansformations, inflicting a −2 penalty on a limited range of actions or similar detriments: physical dependency on an unusual substance, vulnerability to iron, etc. Deep Wyld 7 Daily Addition. Major Derangements, or increasing existing Major Derangements to Defining. Life-altering transformations: bodily reconstructions that impose a −3 penalty on a broad range of actions; eternally rotting and unhealing flesh; sapient, parasitic organs; etc. END TABLE Characters who roll against the Wyld may choose to go into experience debt to purchase up to five dots of thematically appropriate mutations whether they succeed or fail.
