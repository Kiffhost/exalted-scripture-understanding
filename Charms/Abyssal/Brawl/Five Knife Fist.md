*Jagged spikes of dark Essence burst from the Abyssal fingertips, rending through bone and steel.*
The Abyssal adds +(Strength) Overwhelming on an unarmed withering attack. On a decisive unarmed attack, she instead doubles 10s on the damage roll and rolls an additional die of damage for each damage roll 10.
A repurchase of this Charm lets the Abyssal use it as a Simple Charm for five motes, one Willpower, extending its duration to one scene. Alternatively, she can invoke this version reflexively for two motes, one Willpower after damaging an enemy with the Supplemental version of this Charm.
