Stern Mars, the Maiden of Battles, oversees all fated strife: clashing armies, political rivals vying for supremacy, words spoken in anger between young lovers. All conflicts fall under her Chosen’s remit, a duty that calls them to battlefields and boudoirs, alehouses and courtrooms. Heaven’s Soldiers incite hostility and discord when peace outlasts its appointed span, lend their skill at arms and strategy to destined victors, and thwart untimely resolutions to necessary conflicts. Destiny demands their intervention in battles great and small, whether plunging kingdoms into war or teaching a child how to fight back against a bully.

The First Age’s Shieldbearers devoted themselves to Creation’s defense, driving back otherworldly incursions, hunting down terrors that slipped past their watch, and sowing discord among fate’s enemies: playing the Scorpion Empire against the Southern Fair Folk in the Split-Second War, outwitting the thinking-engine Jazex IX’s betrayal of Heaven, holding the Loom of Fate against the Omen-Spore Infestation. They led armies of martial gods to battle, counseled their fellow Exalted in strategy, and coordinated deployments of the Aerial Legion with the Old Realm’s forces. When complacency and world-weariness bred stagnation, Mars’ Chosen provoked their fellow Chosen to action with blunt words, harsh truths, and sound counsel.

The endless conflict of the Second Age leaves much to be done. Occluded by arcane fate, Mars’ Chosen can no longer lead armies or advise Exalted generals openly. Instead, they manipulate events to divert recruits and materiel to forces favored by Heaven, and armor themselves in resplendent destinies as generals’ confidantes, nameless soldiers, or unlikely leaders. They’re still at the fore of martial conflict against enemies of fate, whether hunting down demons loosed by Infernal sorcerers, making preparations against Getimian assaults on Heaven, or disrupting alliances between faerie courts as agents provocateurs.

Destined Shieldbearers’ mortal lives are touched by conflict. Some are born to career military families or martial castes; others are war orphans or the children of refugees. Many grew well-acquainted with violence as conscripts, mercenaries, hired muscle, gladiators, or brawlers. Others were immersed in different kinds of battles: politics, business, athletic competitions, debate, or family vendettas. Shieldbearers’ perspectives on conflict vary widely. Some are all but berserkers, their rage tempered only by duty, while others aspire to pacifism, turning to violence only when they must.

# Auspicious Prospects
## Auspicious Prospects for Battles

The Shieldbearer may pay one mote to learn whether a battle, conflict, or rivalry would align with destiny and any relevant details of about the conflict’s circumstances, like who should win. 

## Lesser Sign of Mars

The Shieldbearer may pay five motes to reflexively make Mars’ lesser sign with a flash of crimson stardust. Until her next turn, she and all allies within close range gain +1 non-Charm Defense and add (her Essence, maximum 5) non-Charm dice on War rolls. This is free at bonfire. 

## Greater Sign of Mars

Once per story, the Shieldbearer may pay twenty motes and one Willpower to make the Mars’ greater sign, casting a baleful crimson glow down from the heavens. She rolls (Wits + [Archery, Brawl, Melee, Presence, or War]), granting Initiative equal to her successes to herself and each of her allies. This uses her entire turn. For the rest of the scene, she and her allies add (her Essence) to their base Initiative. Battle groups instead gain Might 2.
