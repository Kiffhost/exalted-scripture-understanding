*Imbued with the [[Essence]] of Daraya’s spirit shape, the [[Shadow Moth Raiment]] empowers other Lunars who follow her path as a martial artist.*
While using a Form Charm, the Lunar always gains the Protean effects of [[Cryptic Unknown Beast]], [[Cunning Prey Reversal]], Midnight Phantom [[Movement]], and [[Nimble Squirrel Evasion]] (Lunars, p. 186-187, 192-193).
