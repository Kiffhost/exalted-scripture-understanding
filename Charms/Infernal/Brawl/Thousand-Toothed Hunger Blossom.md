*Gnashing, fanged mouths open across the Infernal’s body, hungrily searching for delectable morsels of foe.*

The Infernal’s transformation grants the following benefits:
- She adds [[Slavering Horror Maw|Slavering Horror Maw's]] damage bonus on all bite attacks, not just savaging attacks. This isn’t compatible with the bonus damage from the [[Slavering Horror Maw#All-Consuming Digestion (Brawl 5, Essence 3, Carrion-Picking Appetite (Brawl 4) (2m) Carrion-Picking Appetite )|All-Consuming Digestion]] and [[Slavering Horror Maw#Carrion-Picking Appetite (Brawl 4) (2m)|Carrion-Picking Appetite]] keys.
- On savaging attacks, she converts damage diced added by [[Slavering Horror Maw|Slavering Horror Maw's]] damage to automatic successes.
- Once per round, she can pay three motes to reflexively make a decisive counterattack against an enemy who attacks from close range, or a decisive savaging attack against a grappled enemy. It has (higher of Essence or 3) dice of damage and doesn’t reset her Initiative. If she’s capable of eating her victim and has a Tie of hunger toward him, she adds (Intimacy) dice on the attack and damage rolls.
- Enemy’s rolls to disengage from her suffer a −2 penalty if she’s capable of eating them.
