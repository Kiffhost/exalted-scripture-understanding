*Passion, pride, and the incomparable music of the Yozis fill the Infernal’s heart as she launches into her performance.*

The Infernal adds (Essence) dice on a Performance roll, and rolls an additional non-Charm die for each 10 she rolls. Demons count as having a Minor Principle based on their delight in this performance, unless they have an Intimacy that opposes the Infernal’s influence.

The Infernal’s performance must incorporate elements of the Demon City’s art and aesthetics, whether consciously or not. Characters with first-hand experience or a relevant Lore, Occult, or Performance specialty can notice this with a difficulty 7 ({Perception or Intelligence} + relevant Ability) roll.
## [[Keys]]
#### Hell’s Strange Beauty (Performance 3)
The Infernal may choose to add a non-Charm success instead of rerolling a die for any of her 10s. Each success she adds lowers the difficulty of the roll to notice her performance’s demonic aesthetics by two, minimum (Essence).
