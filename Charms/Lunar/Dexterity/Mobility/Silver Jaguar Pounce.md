*Sensing weakness, the Lunar moves in for the kill.*
When an enemy within short range is crashed or suffers enough decisive damage to increase his wound penalty, she moves one range band toward him. This doesnâ€™t count as her move action. If she makes a decisive attack against him on or before her next turn, she adds ([[Essence]]) dice of damage. If the Lunar knows [[Relentless Cheetah Pace]], she may use it with this Charm to advance on a foe within medium range, instantly moving to close range.
