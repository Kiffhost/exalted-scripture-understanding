*Subjecting society to her withering scrutiny, the Abyssal sees others as they truly are.*
The Abyssal doubles 9 on a read intentions roll and can use [[Wits]] instead of [[Perception]].
With a [[Socialize]] 4 repurchase, if the Abyssal’s roll uncovers one of a character’s Intimacies, her player may speculate about another, related [[Intimacy]] the target may have. The [[Storyteller]] informs her if her guess is correct..
With a [[Socialize]] 5 repurchase, if the Abyssal’s player guesses incorrectly about a target’s related Intimacies, she may make a second guess.
