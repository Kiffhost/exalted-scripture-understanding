*The Infernal incites a frenzy of commerce, inspiring merchants and thieves alike.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation + Bureaucracy) inspire roll with (higher of Essence or 3) dice against all characters who can perceive her, ignoring multiple target penalties. She doesn’t need to speak to do so, and can’t be discerned as the source of the influence. Affected characters are driven to engage either in commerce, theft, or some similar form of transaction, although the exact actions they take are still determined by their player. Resisting this influence requires entering a Decision Point and citing a Major or Defining Intimacy to spend one Willpower.
### Keys
#### Boom-and-Bust Frenzy (Essence 2) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, affected characters must act on their inspiration an additional time for every three extra successes the Infernal rolls over their Resolve.
