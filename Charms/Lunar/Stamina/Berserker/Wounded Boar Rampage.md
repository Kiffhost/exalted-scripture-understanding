Drawing closer to death, the Lunar’s will is renewed. She will either survive, or bring down her killer with her. When she suffers damage to a –2 or deeper health level, she gains one [[Willpower]], unless she’s crashed. This can raise her temporary [[Willpower]] above her permanent [[Willpower]] rating. Damage incurred by paying health level costs doesn’t grant [[Willpower]]. This Charm can only be used once per scene. It doesn’t reset while the Lunar has damage in her –2 or deeper health levels.
