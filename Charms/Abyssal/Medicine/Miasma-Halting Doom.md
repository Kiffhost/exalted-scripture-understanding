*Death’s Lawgiver brings plagues to heel, slaying disease with death-graced hands.*
The Abyssal spends an hour treating a patient suffering from disease, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) against its morbidity. Her patient adds half her extra successes, rounded up, on his next roll against the disease’s morbidity as long as he remains in convalescence until then. Treatment with this Charm is capable of curing otherwise incurable diseases.
