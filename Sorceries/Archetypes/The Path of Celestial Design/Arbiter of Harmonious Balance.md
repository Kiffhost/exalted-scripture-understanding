Once per scene, when the sorcerer creates, strengthens, or facilitates a bureaucratic process, cooperative relationship, negotiation, business deal, or similar arrangement, she gains ([[Bureaucracy]] + extra successes) sorcerous motes, which last until the story ends. If the arrangement was between gods, she gains additional sorcerous motes equal to the (highest god’s Essence/2, round up). If her achievement wasn’t rolled, she rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Bureaucracy]]) for this. She can only have sorcerous motes from one use of this ritual at a time; gaining more replaces any previous uses.
