Sensing an impending danger rippling toward her through the skeins of fate, the Sidereal deftly steps out of its path. The Sidereal can use Evasion to defend against any hostile effect: undodgeable attacks, environmental hazards, falling damage, social influence, Shaping effects, etc. If the effect is one that could normally be opposed with a dice roll or static value, the Sidereal substitutes her Evasion for successes on the roll or the applicable static value. If it isn’t, the Storyteller should assign a dice pool for the source’s effect to roll against the Sidereal’s Evasion. Against ongoing or recurring effects, once the Sidereal successfully defends with this Charm, she’s immune for the rest of the scene. Duck Fate can only defend against the actions and magic of other characters and environmental effects with defined mechanics. Appropriate stunts may bypass this limitation, letting a Sidereals dodge performance review, debts, her feelings, etc.
