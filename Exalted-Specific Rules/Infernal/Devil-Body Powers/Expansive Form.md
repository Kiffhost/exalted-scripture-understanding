The Infernal encompasses a wide area, allowing her to become a living tidal wave, a veinous root system or profane temple. This has the following benefits:
- When she transforms, she can choose to displace terrain within short range, pushing it back one range band to make way for her grandeur. Depending on how this power manifests, this can be temporary, as she warps the boundaries of space for the duration of her transformation in the manner of Hell’s arcane topography, or permanent, as she crushes erodes away that which would confine her or crushes it like a layer of the Demon City.
- The area within short range of her counts as difficult terrain for her enemies.
- When she attacks an enemy, she can count as being one range band closer or further away from him, whichever is more advantageous. She gains the same benefit when enemies make ranged attacks against her.
- She gains [[Dispersed Form]] and [[Area Attack]] for free.
- Some variants of Expansive Form are immobile but encompass a much larger area. The Infernal cannot move from her location, but she destroys or displaces terrain within long range when she transforms, can count as being three range bands closer (but not further away) for the purposes of attacks, and can count any area within long range as difficult terrain for her enemies.
