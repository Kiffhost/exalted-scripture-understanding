The intensity of the Lunar’s mien awakens instinctual panic. She doubles 9s on a roll to instill a Tie of fear toward herself (or her current form) or threaten her target. Protean: Characters with a Tie of fear toward the Lunar’s current shape lose one [[Initiative]] (which she doesn’t gain) if her roll beats their [[Resolve]] in combat, even if they resist with [[Willpower]].
