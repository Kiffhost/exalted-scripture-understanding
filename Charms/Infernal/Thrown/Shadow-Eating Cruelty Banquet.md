*The Infernal’s shadow warps and distorts into a monstrous outline, drawing in and devouring all lesser shades.*

To use this Charm, the Infernal must have 15+ Initiative. She makes an unblockable and undodgeable withering attack against the Resolve of all enemies within her weapon’s range. Targets use their Willpower instead of their soak for reducing the attack’s raw damage. The Infernal gains all Initiative from the highest damage roll, and up to (enemy’s Essence, maximum 5) from other damage rolls.

The Infernal’s shadow devours those of all enemies who take more than (their Essence) withering damage from this or are crashed. They lose motes equal to the amount of Initiative lost, maximum (their Essence), which the Infernal gains. Shadows devoured with this Charm are lost permanently, though this can be undone as if it were a sorcerous curse.
### Blasphemy
If the Infernal’s [[Devil-Body]] has the [[Area Attack]] feature, she doesn’t need 15+ Initiative to use this Charm.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by [[Despair-Choked Spirit Maiming]] to weaken one of a nontrivial enemy’s Intimacies.
