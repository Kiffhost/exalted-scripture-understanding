*The Abyssal killer strikes between eyeblinks, vanishing before the first drop of blood falls to the ground.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she incapacitates an enemy, letting her reflexively roll [[Stealth]] to enter concealment. She adds her attack roll extra successes and any excess levels of damage beyond her foe’s Incapacitated level to the [[Stealth]] roll as automatic successes.
With a [[Stealth]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm after a decisive attack that deals 3+ damage even if she doesn’t incapacitate her enemy, but must forgo two levels of damage to do so.
