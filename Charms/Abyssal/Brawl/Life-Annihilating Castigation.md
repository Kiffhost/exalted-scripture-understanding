*Soul-destroying pyreflame swirls like an inferno around the Abyssal, revealing the awful depths of her wrath.*
The Abyssal makes a withering attack, multiplying her post-soak damage by her (opponent’s base wound penalty + 1) and rerolling 1s on the damage roll.
If the deathknight crashes her opponent, pyreflame erupts from within him, inflicting (Abyssal’s [[Strength]]) dice of aggravated decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]] and rerolling 1s until they cease to appear. Each 10 on the withering damage roll adds another die of decisive damage — and if the Abyssal used Entropic Scourge, so do 9s. An opponent killed with this attack is burned away to nothing, leaving no ghost or even ashes.
## Reset
