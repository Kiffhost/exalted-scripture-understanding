A phylactery of great sorcerous puissance, this talisman is wrought from rune-etched orichalcum and set with a gleaming ruby of ten facets. Each facet seems to reflect ten more within its depths, which reflect even more, creating the illusion of infinity that gives this relic its name. You have claimed the talisman as your own, using it either to initiate yourself into [[sorcery]] or as a wellspring of power to draw upon. Its ten thousand eyes are ever watchful, giving warning when malefic forces roam unchecked, and serving as a lens through which you may cast your sight or presence.
