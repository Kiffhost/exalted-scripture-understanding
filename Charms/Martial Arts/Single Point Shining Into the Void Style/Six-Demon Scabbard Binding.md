Sweeping her blade through the motions of an intricate Essence-channeling pattern, the stylist forces hostile magic to condense itself into form, taking on shape as a howling devil which she swiftly dispatches and seals away as she sheathes her sword. The Six-Demon Scabbard Binding allows the swordsman to defend against a warping, twisting, or shaping effect that would alter her mind or body by making a clash attack against it, opposed by the activation roll of the effect. If the magic has no roll, its user rolls (Essence + Willpower), or a more suitable dice pool chosen by the Storyteller. Success on the clash attack allows the swordsman to strike through the manifest devil of the magic and its master with a single stroke. She may even clash against distant enemies, sending the devil howling back at its creator to deliver her wrath (which can strike dematerialized enemies as well as material ones). The Six-Demon Scabbard Binding can also be used to cut a clear path through ambient or environmental transformative magic, such as the warping effects of the Wyld, at a cost of 4m. The stylist rolls (Dexterity + Martial Arts) against the difficulty to resist the effect, or an ad hoc difficulty set by the Storyteller. Success lets the swordsman cut a metaphysical path for herself, rendering her immune to that magic for one scene. It was with this Charm that Eternal Nova, the mythic creator of this style, defeated his own shadow to carve a path out of oblivion, giving this style its name. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood may only use this Charm to defend against hostile magic, and cannot make a clash attack against the character using it unless she uses Horizon-Swallowed Star Flash along with this Charm.
