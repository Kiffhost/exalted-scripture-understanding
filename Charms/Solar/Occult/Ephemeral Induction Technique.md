The Solar reaches into the Essence of the world to rip new life from the very fabric of Creation. This Charm allows the Solar to induct a single spirit into the world. She draws this creature from her surroundings, but may also use the Essence-patterns of spirits she has captured with Burning Exorcism Technique or absorbed with Carnal Spirit Rending to determine the being’s nature and magic. The spirit begins the game with the Solar’s Essence rating and half her total experience, but may only use the most basic spirit Charms until the Storyteller has had sufficient time to approve the spirit’s stats, Intimacies, and magic, as determined by the Solar’s player. This spirit is bound to the Solar as a familiar and becomes an applicable target for certain Survival Charms. A spirit created by the Solar is her thrall for a season. She may then choose to keep it as her familiar or release it. Freeing the current familiar allows her to use this Charm again to create a new familiar. If she decides to retain a bond with the original creature, then she keeps it for another season. Each season that comes and goes, she may choose to retain or relinquish her bond with the spirit so that she may attain a new familiar. Otherwise, the spirit remains as her familiar and is in all senses another character, gaining experience points as any character would. Alternately, the Solar may also induct a Fair Folk into the world. In the Wyld, this Charm usually entails the creation of a raksha, but in Creation, where many denizens of the Wyld were bound into place by the elemental fusion of the Poles, the result is bound to be more unpredictable.
