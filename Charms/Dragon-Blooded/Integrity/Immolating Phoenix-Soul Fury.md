The soul-twisting lies of Anathema and the curses of sorcerers cannot hope to tame the boundless fire of the Dragon-Blood’s heart. If a Psyche effect (Exalted, p. 253) would cause her to act against one of her Intimacies, she may instead use this Charm to enter a berserk state in which her will cannot be constrained. The Psyche effect is completely suppressed for the duration, but she cannot take any actions except to engage in hostilities. She may fight as best she sees fit, including using disengage actions to tactically reposition herself, but cannot withdraw from combat or accept an enemy’s surrender. The only social influence she may attempt is threatening foes. If she’s not in combat, then she must either devote herself entirely to seeking out a specific enemy, or provoke other characters into hostilities. She cannot end this Charm voluntarily. If the Dragon-Blood defeats the character responsible for inflicting the Psyche effect on her while in this rage, the unnatural influence is permanently broken, and she gains two Willpower. This can raise her above her permanent Willpower. This Charm may only be used once per story, unless reset by subsequently upholding through violence or intimidation the Intimacy it was used to protect.
