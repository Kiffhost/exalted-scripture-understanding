*This green leather jacket — made with a patchwork of hides from a dozen God-Blooded monsters — is reinforced with starmetal plates and epaulettes, and rivets of opal mined from the bottom of the Great Western Ocean.*
The starmetal was excavated by deep-sea diver and archaeologist Ebony Maelstrom, a [[Chosen of Secrets]] who used one of Yu-Shan’s ancient wonders to spend decades exploring long-forgotten ocean floors all over the world. In the Great Western Ocean’s deepest abysses, he found an immense meteor, touched by so many disparate spirits’ Essences that the only distinct power he could extract safely was their shared immaterial nature. He brought the unprecedented phenomenon back to the workshops of the Heavenly City to be preserved in artifact form for the Sidereal host’s use, and to this day it’s occasionally requisitioned by Sidereal Circles embarking on dangerous missions. This armor can trick the Loom of Fate into seeing its wearer as a spirit, and he becomes as they are, intangible as the wind.
