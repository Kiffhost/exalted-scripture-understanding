*The Abyssal shrouds her soul in shadow, dead to the world â€” and to herself.*
After meditating for an hour, the Abyssal conceals one of her [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. It cannot be detected by [[read intentions]] actions or similar effects, though her behavior may still reveal it.
This Charm can be stacked to conceal multiple Intimacies.
