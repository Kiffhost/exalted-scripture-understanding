This stone protects a single settlement, which can be as large as a small city or as tiny as a village of a dozen people.
It cannot be used to protect a vast metropolis like Nexus, Chiaroscuro, or the Imperial City, because such settlements are simply too large to be hidden. This stone protects the city against anyone traveling there via mundane means with an intent to conquer, rob, harm or disrupt the city as a whole or a large number of its inhabitants.It has no ability to deter anyone with a supernatural ability to locate places, but everyone else hostile to the city will become lost. A seemingly straight road to the city seems to twist and double back upon itself in impossible ways. This stone increases the difficulty for hostile people to locate this settlement to 5, even if they are traveling on a road that seems to head directly to the city or town. Anyone without hostile intent must still make a difficulty 1 roll to locate this settlement.
If a hostile person or army accompanies a guide with no ill intent, the guide is almost certain to become separated from the bandits or invaders. Merchants, pilgrims, performers and other travelers have little trouble locating the city; only those who seek to harm it will be unable to locate it.
