Each of the Gaoler of Uqad’s jackals is a sinewy, undead canine six feet tall with long, sleek limbs, jagged yellow fangs, and griseous fur wrapped in blood-blackened bandages. They can speak in stilted Old Realm, punctuated by cruel laughter. The jackals abhor deception and are employed by the Gaoler (and necromancers) to detect and punish liars.

Offensive Charms
Razored Confession Smile (8m, 1wp; Supplemental; Instant;
Decisive-only): After a successful decisive attack roll, the target must either confess a significant deception they’ve made or else suffer five additional dice of decisive damage.
The confession should be what is most relevant to the scene or necromancer; if the Storyteller doesn’t have one in mind, they should ask players for suggestions. Once per scene.
Shadow-Seizing Jaws (10m; Supplemental; Instant):
The jackal attacks a known but unseen enemy within close range, whether invisible, in concealment, etc.
Any penalty it suffers from this is halved, rounded down, and it adds (necromancer’s Essence) dice on the attack roll. It can strike dematerialized targets.
Defensive Charms
Dancing Among Serpents (6m [+1wp]; Reflexive; Instant; Uniform): The jackal adds (necromancer’s Essence) Evasion and reduces penalties to Defense by three, including surprise attack penalties. For a fourmote, one-Willpower, it may defend against an ambush normally, though it doesn’t receive this Charm’s other benefits.
Swift-Shadowed Guardian (5m; Reflexive; Instant):
The jackal reflexively takes a defend other action to protect its rider, using Evasion instead of Parry.
Mobility Charms
Loyal Predator Saddle (10m, 1wp; Simple; Indefinite):
The jackal grows and elongates to bear up to (necromancer’s Essence + 3) riders. It adds one automatic success on movement actions.
Social Charms
Laughing at Calumny (10m; Reflexive; Instant):
Against social influence meant to deceive, gain +(necromancer’s Essence) Resolve and ignore Resolve penalties, except those from Intimacies. If the influence roll doesn’t beat the jackal’s Resolve, its hideous laughter grants all other characters +2 Resolve against it.
Weight-of-Sin Excoriation (15m; Reflexive; Instant):
After successfully resisting influence meant to deceive the hound or its master, the jackal makes an
Intimidation roll, penalizing the liar’s Resolve by −1 for each success he failed by. On success, the target must flee the scene or admit their crime and beg forgiveness. Resisting requires entering a Decision
Point and citing a Major or Defining Intimacy to pay two Willpower. Once per scene.
Distortion (13): A rival sorcerer may contort the shade’s Essence, forcing them to materialize and inflicting a −1 penalty to their physical actions.
Void Circle Spells
Birth of Sanity’s Sorrow
Cost: 30nm, 3wp
Keywords: None
Duration: One scene
Drowning in shadow of utmost black, the necromancer emerges transformed into a monstrosity that reflects her darkest impulses — strong as sorrow, fleet as fear, armored in tragedy and abhorrence.
The necromancer undergoes a grotesque transformation, marking her as an avatar of death. She gains four of the following powers or traits, chosen when she first learns this spell.
Banquet of Blood: Blood is drawn to the necromancer, knitting her wounds and quickening her fury. She gains two temporary −0 health levels, which are the first to be damaged and which heal at the start of each turn. Once per round, when a living character within medium range suffers decisive damage, she can heal one level of non-aggravated damage or gain (2 + target’s base wound penalty) Initiative.
Blood-Forged Body: The necromancer’s form swells with meaty sinew. She gains two bonus dots of
Strength, which can raise her above 5. She can make a reflexive feat of strength with a free full Excellency once on each of her turns.
Cataclysm Mantle: The necromancer is wreathed in balefire and void-stuff. This is an environmental hazard that extends out to short range, with difficulty 5 and Damage 5L/round. Trivial characters are always slain instantly.
Fivefold Slaughter Harbinger: The necromancer can reflexively make an attack against an enemy battle group or all trivial enemies within range of her weapon once on each of her turns. She can reflexively activate a Simple Charm that creates an attack for this attack.
Hundred-Armed Horror: The necromancer grows multiple appendages of flesh, shadow, or Essence.
She rolls (Wits + Occult) to Join Battle, establishing a new Initiative track. She still takes only one turn per round but can use either track interchangeably when determining her turn, taking damage, paying costs, or gaining Initiative. If she lands a decisive attack, she resets the track she made the attack with.
Legendary Size: The necromancer gains the
Legendary Size Merit (p. XX).
Monstrous Mien: The necromancer gains 2 bonus dots of Appearance, which can raise her above 5, and gains the Hideous Merit. She doesn’t suffer penalties for flurrying attacks with influence rolls. If she hits an enemy with an attack, he suffers −2 Resolve against her next influence roll against him that scene. Likewise, successful influence rolls penalize Defense against her attacks.
Singularity of Purpose: The silence of the void quiets the necromancer’s mind. She treats any influence that would cause her to stand down, lessen her attack, or hesitate as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). Once per scene, she may reduce the Willpower cost of resisting influence or using a Charm or similar effect by one.
Once per story, when the necromancer’s Incapacitated health level is filled with damage, she may reflexively cast this spell, rolling (current temporary Willpower +
Essence) to gather necromantic motes. She can spend her own motes as if they were necromantic motes toward the spell’s cost. If she gathers enough to cast the spell, she also heals her Incapacitated level and gains (Essence) additional −0 health levels. These levels are the first to be damaged and are lost when filled. If she survives the scene, she cannot regain Willpower through sleep for seven days, wracked by nightmares of her own near-destruction.
Control: The necromancer may choose an additional feature for her transformation. Spirits of Creation automatically sense her potential for annihilation, and count as having a Minor Tie of hatred towards her.
