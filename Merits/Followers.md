This Merit may be re-purchased as many times as desired.
Each purchase represents a number of mortal followers with some particular form of expertise that have flocked to the characterâ€™s banner. The nature of these followers must be decided upon each time this Merit is purchased.
Examples might include bureaucrats, bodyguards, assassins, merchants, spies, entertainers, smiths, or astrologers.
Such followers are of average to above-average skill in their professions (two or three dot Ability ratings), but are personally loyal to the character (rather than to an organization the character might have Backing from, or might lead through Influence), and might be trained to greater expertise over time.
One dot grants up to a dozen followers, two grants up to 50, while three grants a group of up to a hundred.
