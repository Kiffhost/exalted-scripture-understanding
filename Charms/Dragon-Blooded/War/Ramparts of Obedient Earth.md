*The battlefield is clay to be sculpted in accordance with the tactical genius of the Terrestrial general.*
To use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must be leading her soldiers. She may roll to [[Join Battle]] with ([[Intelligence]] + [[War]]), and receives a number of points equal to her [[Join Battle]] successes that she may spend to reshape the battlefield: Sinkhole (1-5 points): The Dragon-Blood tears open a !!sinkholebetweentheranksofanenemyarmyorsculpts!! stone into a constricting obstruction. The ground out to close range from an enemy battle group becomes difficult terrain, and the battle group acts last on the first turn regardless of its place in [[Initiative]] order. The point cost is the [[Size]] of the battle group targeted. Barricade (4 point): The Dragon-Blood wrenches up great masses of earth and compresses them into barriers or walls, instantly enacting a [[Fortifications]] stratagem (Exalted, p. 212). Sapping (7 points): If an enemy general has successfully employed a [[Fortifications]] stratagem, the Dragon-Blood may negate its benefits by tunneling through earth and stone, or otherwise creating ways to bypass the fortifications. The Dragon-Blood’s forces don’t treat the terrain as difficult, and may reflexively advance one range band towards the enemy forces. The Storyteller may also adjudicate additional advantages depending on the context of the battlefield. Reshape Battlefield (10 points): If the Dragon-Blood has successfully enacted a [[Strategic Placement]] stratagem (Exalted, p. 212), she may resculpt the battlefield to her specifications, preparing it before the battle and ensuring her enemy will fight her there. She might prepare rows of trenches and fortified towers of earth for her own forces, while forcing her enemy to traverse pits filled with stone spikes, narrow stone tunnels, and similar obstacles. The Storyteller adjudicates the specific effects of these creations. She cannot directly harm foes with the moving !!stone,althoughshecancreatealltypesoftrapsanddangers.!!
