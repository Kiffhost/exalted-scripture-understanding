Filling her body with the incredible weight of mountains and continents, the Dragon-Blood refuses to be moved. She cannot be knocked back by smash attacks, thrown in agrapple,orshiftedbycomparablemundaneforces.Even magic is impeded by this Charm, although not entirely negated, with the Storyteller adjudicating the specific nature of the defense based on the nature of the Charm being used: A Solar using Heaven Thunder Hammer might be forced to halve her damage successes when determining how far she can knock the Dragon-Blood. This Charm ends if she moves from the spot where she used it, or if sheâ€™s crashed or incapacitated.
