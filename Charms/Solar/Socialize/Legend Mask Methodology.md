This Charm permanently upgrades all purchases of [[Heart-Eclipsing Shroud]].
The player can now purchase [[Charms]] for each persona using the experience granted by this Charm’s prerequisite, paying favored or non-favored prices as the persona’s character sheet dictates. With this Charm, the persona may learn Solar [[Charms]] the Exalt does not herself know. Knowledge of this Charm increases the Solar’s deep mental and spiritual investment in her many personas. When she shifts into such a persona, she becomes increasingly vulnerable to her created passions. While in the guise of a persona, each time the Solar vents a point of [[Limit]] through an epic defense of one of her persona’s Principles or Ties, the corresponding [[Intimacy]] is copied to her list of true [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], temporarily voiding the strongest opposing [[Intimacy]] or the strongest [[Intimacy]] which is antithetical to her persona’s character concept. The voided [[Intimacy]] cannot be restored until the transferred [[Intimacy]] has been eroded away, but the Exalt is as compelled by this Defining [[Intimacy]] as any other, and acting in accordance with it may cause her personality to transform even further. 
## Specialactivationrules

This Charm retroactively lowers the cost of Flawlessly Impenetrable [[Disguise]] to three motes when it is activated during the four hour dramatic action described in [[Heart-Eclipsing Shroud]]. If [[Perfect Mirror]] is used during that time, ignore that Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost.
