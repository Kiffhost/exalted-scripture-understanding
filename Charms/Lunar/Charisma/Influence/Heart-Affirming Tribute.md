*The Lunar rewards her champions with puissant gifts, be they jewels plucked from ancient treasure-houses or humble stones etched by her claw.*
After witnessing another character undertake a difficult or dangerous act that upholds one of her Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], she may empower a mundane object as a talisman. While that character bears the talisman, it grants him one [[Eclipse]] Charm chosen by the Lunar, provided he meets its [[Essence]] minimum. This can be an existing [[Eclipse]] Charm, or a custom one designed by the Storyteller with the Lunar’s player. If the recipient is mortal, the Charm should cost [[Willpower]], [[Initiative]], health levels, or other non-mote resources. No character can bear more than one talisman. The talisman is nigh-indestructible, comparable to an artifact. It has no power in the hands of anyone but the chosen character, but if he witnesses someone else perform a heroic feat that upholds one of his Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], he may transfer the talisman — and its Charm — to that character. The talisman’s power fades if this Charm ends, but the Lunar can reactivate a talisman at any time with a second use of this Charm, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost. This Charm’s mote cost is waived if the talisman’s beneficiary benefits from [[Culture-Hero Empowerment]], though the Lunar must pay it immediately if CultureHero Empowerment ends. At [[Essence]] 5, the Lunar may pay a two-experience-point surcharge to make a permanent talisman, requiring no mote commitment on her part. 

## Special activation rules

The Lunar may pay 10 gold points in place of this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost, or 10 white points in place of its [[Essence]] 5 experience point cost.
