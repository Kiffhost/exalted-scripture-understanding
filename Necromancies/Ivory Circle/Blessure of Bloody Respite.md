*In profane mockery of the gods, the necromancer rips open the flesh of reality, shaping this wound into a temporary shelter.*
The necromancer opens an extradimensional wound in the air with a ritual that takes at least a few minutes. Those with her permission may pass through it into a sanctum like a god’s, but with walls of polished bone and fountains of spiritual gore. This space has room to hold (Essence x5) guests comfortably, though it has no amenities. It counts as a shadowland, rendering ghosts material, though it doesn’t open into the Underworld. It persists for up to a week; after that, the wound knits itself closed. Characters and objects left within are deposited safely outside.
A necromancer who chooses her location carefully can conceal the wound’s entry, rolling (Wits + Occult) when casting the spell to establish the difficulty to notice it. This roll suffers a −2 penalty from the blessure’s ever-weeping blood.
## Control
As a ritual, the necromancer may cast this spell upon a coffin, casket, or similar vessel meant for the dead, creating a blessure within that travels with her. If she stays in one place too long, such as when sleeping, the air begins to bleed, lightly scoured by her sheer presence.
## Distortion (8)
A rival necromancer may force open the portal to the hidden refuge for up to (his Essence) minutes.
