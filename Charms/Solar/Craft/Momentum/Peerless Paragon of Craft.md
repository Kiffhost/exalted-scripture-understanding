As the Solar works deeper into the soul of her craft, she unlocks wisps and flashes of greater wonders, ancient genius, and dim visions of a lost age. Upon purchasing this Charm, roll a free full ([[Intelligence]] + [[Craft]]) Excellency and convert successes to silver points. In addition, each 10 on this roll also rewards the Solar with a gold point. This roll is repeated at the end of each story.
