*Things go from bad to worse for those caught in the Infernal’s grasp, pinioned with blades meant for her.*

While grappling an enemy with [[World-Breaker Grip]], the Infernal can use him to clash a decisive attack against her. She makes a special decisive attack. If she wins the clash, the attack is redirected to the grappled enemy and automatically hits him. She doesn’t roll damage or reset her Initiative.

If the Infernal’s attacker has a positive Tie toward her victim and incapacitates him, the attacker loses one Willpower.
