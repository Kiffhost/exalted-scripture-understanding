*Twisting the words of accusers and enemies, the Lunar lays her sins on their backs.*
When she’s accused of violating a custom, she may use [[Fox-Tailed Trickster’s Grace]] to excuse her transgression, even if it occurred in the past. If she successfully influences all characters present, she may reflexively use [[Forsaking-the-Blood Posture]] for free, turning the accusation back on her accuser. Each 9 and 10 on her roll for [[Fox-Tailed Trickster’s Grace]] adds a bonus die on Forsaking-theBlood Posture’s roll.
