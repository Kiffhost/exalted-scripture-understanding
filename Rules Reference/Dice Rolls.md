Exalted uses a d10s successes system. Whenever a character attempts something that they might fail at, they roll a test.

### Dice pool

The number of d10s to be rolled, usually equal to an Attribute + Ability. This number is often modified by *bonuses* and *penalties* from things like charms, environmental conditions and [[Health|wounds]].

### Successes

Each dice which rolls above the target number counts as one success. Sometimes particular values count as two successes. This is called "doubling Xs" where x is the number which is doubled. For example, most tests count rolls of 10 as two successes, so we can say most rolls *double 10s*.

### Failures

Dice rolls which are below the threshold, and so are not successes.

### Difficulty

The number of successes required to achieve the stated goal. Rarely exceeds 5.

### Target number

The number above which dice count as a success. Usually 6, can be modified by charms (especially Sidereal charms).

### Botch

A roll in which no successes were achieved, and at least one dice shows a 1. Botches are considered catastrophic moments which complicate the objective for the player characters.
