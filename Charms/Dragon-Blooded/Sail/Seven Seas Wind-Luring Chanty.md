The Dragon-Blood leads her crew in a bawdy chorus, appeasing the spirits of air. When she suffers penalties for sailing against the wind or from other foul weather, she may roll (Charisma + Sail). Every two successes she rolls, rounded down, lowers any penalties she faces by one point. If she uses this Charm in favorable weather, success calls up a wind that keeps her sails filled, increasing any Speed bonus from the shipâ€™s sails by +1.
