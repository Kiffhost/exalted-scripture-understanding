*The Sidereal hides between raindrops, under fallen leaves, and in the steam that rises from a freshly poured tea, keeping her existence a secret from the world.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) to establish concealment in even the most inadequate of hiding spaces, ignoring any related penalties — a blade of grass or a single hair is more than enough for her to hide behind. She can pass through the slightest of openings to hide inside closed containers and other obstructed spaces, even if they’re smaller than she is, though can’t bypass magical barriers or wards. Some hiding spots may offer cover (Exalted, p. 198) or similar circumstantial benefits or obstacles. Once the Sidereal’s hidden with this Charm, she can use it again to move to another hiding spot within close range without crossing the space between them, ignoring [[Stealth]] penalties for movement. While using [[Walking Outside Fate]], this Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived.
