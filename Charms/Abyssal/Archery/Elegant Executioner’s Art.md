*The deathknight draws in close, savoring the fear in her victim’s eyes.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when she attacks from close range. A withering attack’s [[Accuracy]] is calculated as if it had been made from short range, and it adds (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) [[Overwhelm|Overwhelming]]. A decisive attack adds a non-Charm success on the [[Attack#hit roll|attack roll]].
With an [[Archery]] 4 repurchase, this Charm can enhance attacks from any [[range]] as long as the deathknight uses her [[movement]] action to move towards her target on the same [[Time#Tick|tick]]. She also gains this benefit against enemies she’s reflexively pursued him as part of a successful [[rush]] since her last turn.
