*Teaching Intolerable Truths Death’s Lawgiver has gazed upon the end of all things, and shares the dark truths she has seen with her unwilling disciples.*
The Abyssal makes a special ([Charisma or Manipulation] + [[Lore]]) instill roll with ([[Essence]]) bonus dice against a single character, revealing the futility of his life and of life itself. If successful, he gains a Major Principle reflecting his newfound understanding that his life is meaningless and loses two [[Willpower]]. In combat, he also loses four [[Initiative]]. If he has a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] that supports this belief, the instilled Principle becomes Defining. He can’t voluntarily weaken this [[Intimacy]] until he gains [[Willpower]] from upholding a Defining Tie that opposes it.
