Magpie’s Wing holds more tricks than could be mastered in a lifetime.
Upon purchasing this Evocation, the wielder gains two of the following secrets. She can purchase additional secrets for one bonus point or three experience each.
Chained Talon Blade: The skycutter’s wielder may separate it into two half-blades linked by a moonsilver chain, requiring a ready weapon action. It can be used as a fighting chain, but deals lethal damage and is compatible with [[Melee]] (+2 ACC; +9 DMG; +1 DEF; Lethal, [[Melee]], Disarming, Flexible, [[Grappling]], Reaching). In this form, it’s exceptional equipment if used as a grappling hook to aid in climbing or similar tasks. It can be changed back with another ready weapon action.
Eager Accomplice Draw: Once per round, the wielder may reflexively ready [[Magpie’s Wing]]. This can be used for any ready weapon action required by the artifact’s [[Evocations]].
Ever-Expanding Compartment: The hidden compartment can be expanded to take up almost the entirety of the [[skycutter]]. It can contain most objects large enough to be worn or held in one hand, although especially bulky or unwieldy objects may be too large.
Hidden Talon Trick: [[Magpie’s Wing]] can be shrunk down to the size of a dagger with a ready weapon action, granting it the Concealable tag (Exalted, p. 588). In this form, it can be wielded as a knife (+4 ACC, +7 DMG; Lethal, [[Melee]], [[Thrown]] (Short), Concealable). It can be changed back with another ready weapon action.
Jeweled Egg’s Nest: Magpie’s Wing’s secret compartment can be used as an actual hearthstone slot.
Quicksilver Pinion Trick: The skycutter’s wielder may remove one of its feathers with a ready weapon action, a slender shaft that can be used for many purposes. It’s exceptional equipment for picking locks and for [[Linguistics]] rolls where the wielder’s handwriting matters, like forgery. It can also be thrown as a dart (ACC: Close +4, Short +3, Medium +2, Long −1, Extreme −3; +7 DMG; Lethal, [[Thrown]] (Medium), Concealable, Mounted, Poisonable).
