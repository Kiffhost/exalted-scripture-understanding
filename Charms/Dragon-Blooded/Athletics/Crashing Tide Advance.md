Like the relentless tide that erodes the shore, the Dragon-Blood’s advance is inevitable, her momentum undeniable. She adds an automatic success on a rush.
If she successfully rushes her enemy and he subsequently provokes her reflexive movement, she inflicts a −1 onslaught penalty on him, and if she attacks him from close range on her next turn, she adds one die of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage.
