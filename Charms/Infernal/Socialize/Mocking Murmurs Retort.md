*The Infernal parrots a rival’s words or turns them against him in an insulting oration, vocalizing anti-speech that strips those words of her power.*

When a character makes an influence roll against the Infernal, she rolls (Manipulation + {Performance or Socialize}) and adds her successes to her Resolve against that influence. She must mock the influencing character aloud, but need only whisper it to herself. This defense isn’t limited to spoken influence — the Infernal can use this Charm against written influence if she mocks it aloud.

#### Spiteful Contradiction Grin (Socialize 5, Essence 3) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, if the Infernal successfully defends against the influence with her Resolve, the influence roll fails against all other targets, except for those who have a Defining Intimacy that supports the influence. The Infernal must voice her mockery loud enough for the influence’s other targets to hear it.
