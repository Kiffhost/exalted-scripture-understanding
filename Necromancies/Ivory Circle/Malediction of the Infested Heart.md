*With a wretched cooing, the necromancer calls forth a clutch of creeping, writhing pyreworms — passion-eating centipedes of congealed pyreflame.*
The necromancer touches a character (p. XX), rolling (Manipulation + Occult) opposing his (Stamina + Resistance). On success, pyreworms mass and burrow harmlessly into his skin, tunneling inward to wrap themselves around his heart. When he uses an Intimacy based on passionate emotions to bolster his Resolve or in a Decision Point, he must either pay one Willpower or suffer (necromancer’s Essence/2, rounded up) dice of lethal damage, ignoring Hardness. He must also do so when his Resolve is beaten by influence to inspire such emotions. Acting out the lack of passion caused by the pyreworms’ predations counts as dramatizing a Flaw for earning Expression Bonus (Exalted, p. 167).
The spell ends once the victim’s spent (higher of necromancer’s Essence or 3) total Willpower. It can also be cured by magic that can treat supernatural diseases.
In theory, the pyreworms can be removed through radical surgeries, though few in Creation could perform them nonfatally.
## Control
The hot glow of a symbiotic pyreworm is visible beneath the necromancer’s unclothed chest. She may spend five motes or one Willpower to reflexively weaken one of her Intimacies based on passionate emotion by one step or resist a successful inspire roll to spread such feelings.
## Distortion (9)
A rival necromancer may loosen the pyreworms from their host’s heart, waiving the Willpower cost the next time this Charm’s damage is triggered. This still counts toward the total Willpower cost to end this spell.
