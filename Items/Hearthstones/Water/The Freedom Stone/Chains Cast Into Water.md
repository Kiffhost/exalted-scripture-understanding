*The Exalt permanently gains two automatic successes on attempts to escape from inanimate bonds, such as ropes, chains, or binding cuffs; they slide across her skin as though it were slick with water.*
This Evocation doesn’t help with escaping from more general restraint, such as a dungeon cell, though it could get the Exalt free of a leg manacle within the cell.
