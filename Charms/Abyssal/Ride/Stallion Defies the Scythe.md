*The deathknight’s mount weathers all peril in its unceasing labors, unbowed even by fatal blows.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after a damage roll against her mount, sparing it from brunt of the blow.
If a withering attack would crash it, it’s left with one [[Initiative]] instead. If a decisive attack would incapacitate it, any damage to its Incapacitated level is negated.
The deathknight can’t save her mount from being crashed if it already has one [[Initiative]] or fewer, nor can she protect it from incapacitation if it only has its last health level left.
