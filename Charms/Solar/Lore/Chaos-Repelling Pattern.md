By asserting her existence against the ravages of chaos, the Solar makes her person sacrosanct. Through use of this Charm, the Solar protects an area around herself out to short range in every direction. Characters within this area of focus cannot be twisted by the Wyld, nor can their minds be torn asunder by its influence. ChaosRepelling Pattern also forces the environment within its area of effect to behave with the physical laws of Creation. The ground will not transform beneath the Solarâ€™s feet, nor will she suddenly fall into the sky. However, this Charm does nothing to stop creatures of the Wyld from attacking the Solar, nor will it do anything to change their composition. At the end of an hour, if the Exalt chooses to reactivate this Charm, ignore the Willpower cost.
