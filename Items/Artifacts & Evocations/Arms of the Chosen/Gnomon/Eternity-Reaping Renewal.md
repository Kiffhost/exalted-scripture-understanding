## Resonant

This Evocation can only be awakened by a wielder resonant with starmetal. As Gnomon’s master awakens its capstone Evocation, the staff’s wooden head buds, blossoms, and ultimately bears fruit in the form of a single, precious peach. This is one of the fabled peaches of immortality, which she may either eat herself to prolong her own life or give to another character as a medicine, gift, bribe, or similar. Once Gnomon has grown a peach of immortality, it takes a full decade for another one to grow. The wielder may hasten this process by using Gnomon’s power to accomplish a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) by committing an epic heist, legendary crime, or similarly spectacular mischief. Each legendary social goal fulfilled reduces the time it will take the peach to grow by one year.
