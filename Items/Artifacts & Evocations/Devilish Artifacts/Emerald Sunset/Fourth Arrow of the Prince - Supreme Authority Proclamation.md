*Hell is love: So says Ligier. Pain and grief are not a price to pay; they are beauty itself. The wielder demonstrates this lesson by twisting a loving demon into the shape it was meant to have.*

The wielder unravels the Essence of a bound demon within short range as she aims, remaking it as an arrow of light. She can’t do so on unwilling Second or Third Circle demons. When she attacks, she adds (demon’s Essence) dice of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage in addition to the usual benefits of aiming. If she hits, the target and all characters within him also suffers (demon’s Essence) dice of decisive damage.

The wielder can use one of the unravelled demon’s Charms to enhance the attack, paying its cost herself, even if it’s normally incompatible with ranged attacks. She can use a Simple Charm that create an attack, applying its benefit to her own. However, the attack must still make sense as an effect conveyed through her ranged attack. If she uses an Eclipse Charm, she can incur experience debt to learn it instantly.

First Circle demons used as arrows are utterly destroyed. Second and Third Circle demons lose motes equal to the total levels of damage dealt to all targets and are forcibly dematerialized. They cannot willingly materialize again for the rest of the scene, even in realms like Malfeas where they’re naturally material. If the wielder used one of their Charms, they can’t use it again for the rest of the scene.
### Dissonant
