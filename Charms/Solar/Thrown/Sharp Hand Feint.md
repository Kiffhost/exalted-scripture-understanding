Through a feinting gesture, the Exalt lashes out with her anima, disrupting her opponent with a pulse of spirit force. This Charm supplements a distract gambit so that the attack succeeds without a roll. The Solar must still succeed at the Initiative roll for her gambit to be effective, however. Sharp Hand Feint is short range, but the Exalt may spend levels of anima display to increase its range at a rate of one range band per display level, without the need of an aim action.
