This Charm is the technique by which the Solars slew the enemies of the gods, and spirits hate and fear it.
This Charm may supplement attacks made by other Abilities. An attack supplemented by this Charm does aggravated damage against spirits, and draws a number of motes from the spirit equal to the highest wound penalty inflicted by the attack. For example, striking off a number of -1 health levels would give the Solar one mote. Striking off a number of -2 health levels and a -4 would give the Solar four motes. If a spirit is slain by this attack, it is destroyed permanently, and the pattern of its [[Essence]] is subsumed by the Solar’s anima. Destroying a spirit with this Charm grants the Exalt (Solar’s [[Essence]] + spirit’s [[Essence]]) motes.
