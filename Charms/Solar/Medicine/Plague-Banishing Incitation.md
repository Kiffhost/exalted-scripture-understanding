If the Lawgiver generates at least double her patient’s Stamina or Resistance (whichever is greater) in successes through the use of the prerequisite, she may use this Charm to demand that a malaise leave her patient’s body. This causes the disease’s interval to conclude immediately, and allows the patient the benefit of all rather than half the Solar’s extra successes from Ailment-Rectifying Method. If successful, the pestilence immediately vacates the host, and the patient begins to recover over the course of a day. If the Solar saves a character from death’s doorstep through the use of this Charm, she gains one point of temporary Willpower.
