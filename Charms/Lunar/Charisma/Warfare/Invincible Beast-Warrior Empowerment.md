*Wolf-Pack Training Technique Her voice echoing across the battlefield like countless wolves howling, the Lunar general drives her warriors onward to inevitable victory.*
All allied battle groups convert [[Size]]- and [[Might]]-based bonus dice to attack and damage rolls and dice added by [[Drill]] into successes. If the Lunar succeeds on a [[Charisma]]-based command action, the targeted battle group adds ([[Essence]]) successes on rout checks. If it has perfect morale, it instead gains +1 [[Might]], maximum [[Might]] 2. These benefits last until the scene ends or the Lunar targets another battle group with a command action. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Strength]] Charm.
