The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s reckoning of accounts is as perfect as the calm of a still lake. Within its depths, she conceals bureaucratic intrigue and financial maneuvering. She rerolls 5s and 6s until they cease to appear on a [[Larceny]] roll to conceal evidence (Exalted, p. 224) of bureaucratic misdoing such as embezzlement or abuse of authority. A character attempting to discover the hidden evidence must roll ([[Perception]] + [lower of [[Bureaucracy]] or Investigation]).
