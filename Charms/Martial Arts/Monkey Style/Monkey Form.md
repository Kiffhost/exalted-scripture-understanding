The martial artist assumes this style’s distinctive sideways stance — one leg in front of the other, weight on the balls of the feet, arms bent at the elbow, wrists facing down.
 - A successful distract or disarm gambit rolls one die of decisive damage for each 10 on the Initiative roll, ignoring Hardness.
 - She gains +1 Defense.
 - She doubles 9 on rush and disengage rolls.
 - She ignores penalties for being prone.


## Special activation rules

When the stylist succeeds on a distract or disarm gambit against an enemy who is unaware of her or has lower Initiative, she may reflexively enter Monkey Form.
