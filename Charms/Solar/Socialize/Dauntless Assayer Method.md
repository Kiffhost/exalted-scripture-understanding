Upon failing a read intentions action, the Solar may use this Charm to reset her attempt, allowing her to try again. If the player describes a stunt in which the Solar re-engages her target—perhaps by spilling a drink on him, or posing lost beside a road as his carriage rolls up—then the cost of this Charm is reduced by a number of motes equal to the stunt level.
