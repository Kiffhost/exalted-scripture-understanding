Once per scene, when the sorcerer [[Stunt|stunts]] a [[Shape Sorcery]] roll with a description of pain, hunger, emotional turmoil, or other immediate hardships, she accrues an additional (stunt rating) [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery|sorcerous motes]]. If the roll suffers a penalty due to that hardship, she accrues additional sorcerous motes equal to the penalty. Enhancing a [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Control Spell|control spell]] doesn’t count against this ritual’s once-per-scene limit, but it can only benefit a given casting of a spell once.
