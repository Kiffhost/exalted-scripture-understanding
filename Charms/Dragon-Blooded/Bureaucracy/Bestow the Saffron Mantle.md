The Dragon-Blood bestows her favor upon one of her subordinates with a gift, kiss, promotion, or the like, promoting him to her proxy in all bureaucratic matters. This must be done in person. She insinuates her own [[Essence]] into his, allowing him to call upon her judgment and expertise. To become a proxy, the subordinate must have a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the Dragon-Blood. He gains the following benefits: 
-  He gains the benefits of [[Benevolent Master’s Blessing]] at no additional cost. 
-  He intuitively understands how the Dragon-Blood would act in any bureaucratic context or market venue. This doesn’t increase his [[Bureaucracy]] rating,butitdoesallowhimtoknowwhattheDragon-Blood would ask him to do in such a situation. 
-  He adds +1 to the [[Resolve]] bonus against contrary social influence provided by his [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards the Dragon-Blood. Social influence cannot completely erode his [[Intimacy]], although it can weaken its intensity. 
-  Once per day, he may ignore one point of the [[Willpower]] cost to resist any influence opposed to his [[Intimacy|Tie]]. 
-  If the Dragon-Blood knows [[Sense-Riding Technique]],shewaivesitsWillpowercostwhenshe rides her proxy’s senses, and the maximum range of the Charm is extended to ([[Essence]] x50) miles.
