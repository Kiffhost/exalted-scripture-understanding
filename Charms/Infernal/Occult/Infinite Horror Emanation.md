*The Infernal’s tormented psyche screams out to the horizon, upending reality into a world of nightmares.*

The Infernal makes a special ({Charisma, Intelligence, or Manipulation} + Occult) influence roll to inflict nightmares across the land. This influence extends out to one mile for every two successes she rolls, rounded up, affecting everyone within the area. The Infernal can choose to exempt specific characters or locations from this.

Affected characters are haunted by nightmares and can’t gain Willpower from sleeping. Their nightmares are born of their own fears, strengthening one of their fear-based Intimacies by one step each time they sleep unless they spend one Willpower. If they have none, they gain a fear-based Minor Intimacy of the Infernal’s choice. However, if they go a night without sleeping, they lose one Willpower as nightmares rise to the edge of their conscious mind.

The Infernal can use [[Ominous Nightmare Invasion#Glimpse of Distant Nightmares (Occult 5) (+1wp)|Ominous Nightmare Invasion (Glimpse of Distant Nightmares)]] to invade an affected character’s dreams regardless of range, without requiring any interaction with him. She doubles 8s on the roll, or doubles 7s if the target has a Major or Defining Intimacy based on fear.

Once a character has spent (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3) Willpower resisting this, he’s freed from the nightmares. Mortals and First Circle demons can’t break free unless they have no remaining fear-based Intimacies.
