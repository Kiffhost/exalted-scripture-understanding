The Solar sets her feet, raises Shining Ice Mirror to her shoulder, and unleashes a powerful slash, sending a crescent wave of freezing Essence to strike a foe at up to short range. If this decisive attack damages its target, they also suffer a -2 penalty to mobility and to feats of strength for the next (Essence) turns. Successfully striking the opponent with this Evocation grants the Solar one point of Willpower. During her turn, the Exalt may move before using this Evocation, but not afterwards. At Essence 4+, Cold Moon Slash can strike out to medium range if an aim action is used beforehand. 

## Special activation rules

In order to awaken this Evocation, the Solar must defeat a significant foe she has maneuvered into unfavorable fighting conditions by deliberately exploiting Intimacies she uncovered with read intentions actions.
