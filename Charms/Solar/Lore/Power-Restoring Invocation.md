When her anima is blazing, the Solar sees the flows of power clearly. While in combat, she may use this Charm to release her iconic anima. The blazing tendrils of her power race in every direction, striking her allies and drawing new power to them. The range of this effect is unlimited, within the same scene. Roll the Solar’s (Perception + Lore) with (Essence) automatic successes. Convert generated successes into motes of Essence and divide the awards amongst applicable allies. Using this Charm returns the Solar’s anima to the dim level. At Essence 5+, remove the Perilous keyword, allowing her to spend Initiative into the negatives.
