Like the tide, the Dragon-Blood gathers up whatever comes to hand and smashes it against the shore. She waives the [[Initiative]] cost for attacking with improvised weapons using any combat Ability, and may use [[Strength]] instead of [[Dexterity]] to attack with them. Bonus dots of [[Strength]] conferred by magic donâ€™t add to these attack rolls.
