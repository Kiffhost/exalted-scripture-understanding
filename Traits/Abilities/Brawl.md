**This Ability is important in combat.**

Brawl is used by unarmed combatants who fight based on instinct and a natural talent for violence, rather than any particular discipline or style. It’s used for punches, kicks, head-butts, shoulder thrusts, grappling, and all similar methods of using one’s own body as a weapon. Brawl also conveys an aptitude for brawling aids such as brass knuckles and improvised weaponry such as chairs and broken bottles. In addition to covering attacks, Brawl can also be used to calculate a character’s Parry rating in combat, although parrying a weapon capable of inflicting lethal damage with one’s bare hands requires a stunt.
