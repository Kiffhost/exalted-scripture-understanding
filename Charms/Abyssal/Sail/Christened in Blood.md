*Anointing her ship’s deck with blood, the Abyssal empowers both ship and crew with deathly [[Essence]], infusing them with unnatural resilience.*
The Abyssal empowers a ship by shedding her own blood, granting it the following benefits:
 - +1 Speed.
 - It gains (Essence/2, rounded up) temporary −4 [[Hull]] levels. They’re the first −4 levels to be lost and vanish when damaged.
 - [[Crew]] members aboard it who have a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] of loyalty, fear, obedience, or love for the Abyssal add ([[Intimacy]]) to their [[Stamina]] to determine how long they can go without food, water, or air (Exalted, p. 230). Undead crew instead gain an additional −4 health level aboard ship.
This Charm’s health level cost is waived if the Abyssal executes someone aboard ship as she uses it, using the [[sacrifice]]’s blood instead of her own.
