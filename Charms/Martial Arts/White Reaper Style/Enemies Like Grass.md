The martial artist swings her scythe through the ranks of her foes, trailing argent afterimages as she waters the earth with blood. Enemies Like Grass allows the martial artist to make a decisive attack against up to two separate enemies, making a single attack roll but rolling damage separately. Each attack has a base damage of the martial artist’s Strength, and her Initiative is divided evenly among them. She does not reset to base Initiative until she has completed all attacks in this deadly onslaught. Alternatively, she may choose to make two withering attacks against a battle group, rolling each attack individually. While White Reaper Form is active, Enemies Like Grass allows the martial artist to make an additional attack— decisive or withering—for every halo she has. However, at the end of the turn, all halos burn away, as with Bleeding Crescent Strike. 

## Terrestrial

A Dragon-Blood can only use this Charm to make multiple attacks against battle groups.
