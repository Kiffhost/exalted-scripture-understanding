Manipulating the Essence of the five elements that flow through her, the Dragon-Blood conceals her true Aspect. Upon using this Charm, she chooses an element, and the cosmetic appearance of her anima banner and Aspect markings change such that her elemental Aspect appears to be the chosen element. She can’t use this Charm to imitate the anima banners or Aspect markings of specific Dragon-Blooded — rather, her disguised anima and Aspect markings are still reflective of her own personality and nature.
This Charm’s Aspect is the same as the elemental Aspect that the Dragon-Blood emulates.
