The constellations of Sidereal astrology aren’t universal throughout Creation, though they are well-known. Those portions of the Immaculate Texts that address astrology describe these constellations, as do other traditions and cultures with roots in the First Age. However, the Sidereals’ understanding of the constellations isn’t always borne out in a culture’s practice and beliefs. Some use the stars to determine auspicious times to embark on certain endeavors, while others look to them for harbingers of peril. The Immaculate [[Order]] scrutinizes the placement of the Captain on the birth charts of prospective candidates to become the next Mouth of Peace.

Many other cultures have their own intepretations of the stars. Some recognize the same constellations by other names — cultures without seafaring traditions refer to the Mast as the Ash Tree, the Tower, the Obelisk, and other names, while those that don’t make use of bows know Cultures the Quiver as the [[Knife]], the Atlatl, or the [[Sling]]. Others divide the skies into entirely different groupings of constellations. 

The meanings ascribed to Sidereal constellations reflect the Maidens’ understanding of fate and the cosmos, deep truths that are evinced in Sidereal [[Charms]]. However, this doesn’t mean other perspectives are wrong. Those with the gift for astrology can divine portents in the stars no matter what names they know them by. As in often the case in the Maidens’ affairs, the truth is not a singular thing.
