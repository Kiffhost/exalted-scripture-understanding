Struck by a deadly blow, the Lunar sloughs unnecessary flesh to ablate the harm. When she accepts a crippling injury (Exalted, p. 201), she negates an additional (Essence/2, rounded up) levels of damage. This can reduce an attack’s damage below the two levels necessary to take a crippling injury. Additionally, if she’s fighting or endangering herself to uphold a Defining Intimacy, this doesn’t count against the once-per-story limit on crippling injuries. This Charm can only be used once per scene. 
## Protean 

In animal forms with Tail Decoy or similar abilities, the injury doesn’t count against the once-perstory limit even if the Lunar isn’t upholding a Defining Intimacy.
