Two centuries ago, a lone thief drove the Great Houses to wrath. Concealed behind her signature mask, the Artful Tanuki uncovered the Realm’s rarest treasures and most forbidden secrets. She sold both to eager buyers, sowing chaos among the Scarlet Dynasty. Peasants and Dynasts alike speculated about the Artful Tanuki’s prowess and motivations. Magistrates and assassins sought the thief’s head and the mysteries kept therein. After years of infamy, the Artful Tanuki vanished. Then her true work began. Without her mask, no one recognized the daughter of House Cynis as the infamous thief, and her stolen secrets fed a budding political career. Though many spoke of her insolent mask, few recalled the Artful Tanuki’s unassuming staff. [[Calumny]] is a length of bamboo cut from the slopes of the Imperial Mountain and banded with green-and-brown speckled jade. It has been passed down through generations of Cynis blackmailers, offering its secrets to those who feed its hunger. 

## [[Evocations]] of [[Calumny]] 

[[Calumny]] may be collapsed to a jade-tipped rod six inches in length, giving it the Concealable tag (Exalted, p. 588), or extended back to full length, as a reflexive action. [[Calumny]] feeds upon secrets. A secret’s intensity corresponds to the level of task that would be required to persuade the person it concerns to reveal it to the world: inconvenient, serious, or life-changing (Exalted, p. 216). A secret can lose or gain intensity as circumstances change, such as being widely revealed.
