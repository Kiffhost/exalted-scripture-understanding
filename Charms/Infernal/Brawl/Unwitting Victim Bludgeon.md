*The Infernal swings her helpless victim like a ragdoll to batter his allies.*

The Infernal slams a grappled enemy into a second foe within close range or throws him at another within short range. This attack can be withering or decisive. She makes one attack roll against both characters, but rolls damage separately against each of them. On a withering slam or throw, she can’t gain more Initiative than her rounds of control from the damage roll against the second enemy.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by crashing or incapacitating a grappled enemy, or an enemy hit by this attack.
### Keys
#### Splattered Foe Barrage (Brawl 5, Essence 3) (+4m)
When the Infernal throws a grappled enemy, she can pay a four-mote surcharge to throw him an additional range band and create a shockwave, attacking all enemies within short range of the enemy she throws him at. She rolls damage against the grappled enemy normally. On a decisive attack, she divides her Initiative evenly among all other enemies to determine the damage they take. On a withering attack, the Infernal can’t gain more than (Strength) total Initiative from the damage rolls.
