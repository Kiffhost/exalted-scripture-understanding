*The Dragon-Blood’s ship is as tough as she is, suffused with the unyielding [[Essence]] of stone as she sails through perilous storms, enemy fire, or other terrors.*
She reduces the difficulty of a roll needed to avoid damaging her ship by one, or subtracts one success from another character’s roll to damage her ship. This explicitly includes both feats of demolition and offensive Naval Maneuvers.
A Dragon-Blood with this Charm treats the decks of a ship that she pilots as earthen surfaces for the purposes of other Dragon-Blooded [[Charms]].
