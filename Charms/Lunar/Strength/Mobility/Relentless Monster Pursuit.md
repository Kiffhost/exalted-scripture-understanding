The Lunar feeds on her preyâ€™s fear and weakness. She gains two Initiative on a successful rush against a nontrivial foe. For the rest of the scene, she gains one Initiative whenever she moves into close range with him, successfully rushes him, or successfully opposes his disengage rolls. This ends if she moves away from him or rushes a different character. This Charm can only be used once per scene. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Pack Hunting, the Lunar can transfer any Initiative granted by this Charm to an ally within short range.
