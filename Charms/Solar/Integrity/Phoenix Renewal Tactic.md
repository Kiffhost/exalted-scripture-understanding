The Solars went down into a darkness never-ending, but were reborn again in flames. If the Solar is threatened by a warping, shaping, or twisting attack with no clear defense, then this Charm allows the Exalt a chance at such a defense, turning the attack into a contest of wills. Roll the Exalt’s temporary Willpower with double 9s against that of the attacker, treating non-successes on both Willpower rolls as temporary Willpower spent by both parties. The Solar also rolls an additional (Essence) dice, for no Willpower cost, with double 9s, adding successes to her total result. If she wins the contest, she casts off the attempted curse and gains a point of temporary Willpower. She also gains a point of Willpower if all dice on the Willpower roll turn up successes. Succeeding at this Charm lowers the cost of Spirit-Maintaining Maneuver by two motes for the rest of the scene, and immunizes the Solar from being struck by any unrolled effect for (Essence) days. The Solar does not need to be aware of the attack to use Phoenix Renewal Tactic; the Charm makes her automatically aware. She can even use this Charm when she is asleep or otherwise incapacitated. This Charm may be repurchased at Integrity 5+, granting the Exalt one non-Charm automatic success while allowing the Solar to choose to convert two Willpower dice to three automatic successes as well.
