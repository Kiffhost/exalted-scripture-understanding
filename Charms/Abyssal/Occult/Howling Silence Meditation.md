*The tormented cries of the Neverborn echo endlessly in the Abyssal’s soul, whispering of the world’s inevitable end.*
[[Howling Silence Meditation]] enhances the Abyssal’s [[Whispers]] (p. XX), which is required to learn it.
Upon purchasing it, her player chooses two of the following powers. She may purchase additional powers for three experience points or one bonus point each.
Apostle of the End: When the Abyssal upholds death’s chivalry, she may forgo regaining [[Willpower]] to reset her use of [[Whispers]].
Dark Hearts Beat As One: When the Abyssal comes within close range of another character with [[Whispers]], she intuitively senses this. If his player wishes to conceal this from her, she reflexively makes a read intentions roll against him to detect this, adding ([[Essence]]) automatic successes.
Dead Gods’ Hatred: The Abyssal can invoke [[Whispers]] to add +2 non-Charm [[Resolve]] against any influence that opposes one of her negative Intimacies.
Death-Appeasing Wickedness: When the Abyssal undergoes Bleak Expiation (p. XX), she may invoke her [[Whispers]] to either add or subtract (Whispers/2) successes on the roll to lose [[Limit]].
Embracing Damnation: When the Abyssal invokes [[Whispers]], she gains (higher of [[Essence]] or [[Whispers]]) motes.
Nightmares Yet To Come: The Abyssal can invoke [[Whispers]] to gain a glimpse of the future. This works like the [[Reading the Tea Leaves]] ritual (Exalted, p. 490).
Single Will Binding: The Abyssal can invoke [[Whispers]] to add (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) non-Charm dice on an influence roll against creatures of darkness or characters with [[Whispers]]. If all her targets have [[Whispers]], she converts these to non-Charm successes.
Void Prophet’s Mantle: The Abyssal can make her [[Whispers]] obvious to all other characters with [[Whispers]] who can perceive her.
Whispering Secrets: The Abyssal can invoke [[Whispers]] to add (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) non-Charm dice on a read intentions roll against a creature of darkness or character with [[Whispers]]. If her target has [[Whispers]], she converts these to non-Charm successes.
The Abyssal’s player may work with the [[Storyteller]] to create new powers.
