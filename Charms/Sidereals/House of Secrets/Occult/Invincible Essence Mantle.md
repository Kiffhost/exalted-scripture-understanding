*Drawing from the eternal core of her Exaltation, the Sidereal floods her body, mind, and Essence with unassailable divinity.*
The Sidereal adds a free full Excellency on a roll or static value using any Ability against a Psyche effect, Shaping effect, or any effect that interferes with her Essence or magic — ending an ongoing Charm, stealing motes, breaking attunement to an artifact, etc.
Against unrolled effects, this Charm forces an opposed (Willpower) roll. The Sidereal gains −1 target number on her roll. Against environmental effects, the Storyteller sets a difficulty for the Sidereal to roll against.
