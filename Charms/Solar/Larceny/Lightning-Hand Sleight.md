The Solar’s patience hides intense speed. Between breaths, eyeblinks, even thoughts, the Exalt’s hands flash out, changing tiles, switching dice results, trading cards out of dealt hands, moving game pieces, etc. The Exalt’s cheating goes unnoticed so long as she cheats plausibly, skewing the results of only a single round. This deception cannot be realized by onlookers until (Essence + 1) hours have passed. Each time the Solar uses this Charm in a single game, she lowers that expectation by roughly one hour. At Essence 1, she may not be caught immediately on her third use of the Charm, but while her foes still cannot see her cheating, they can notice the effects of her slick dealing. This Charm doubles as Poison-Hand Sleight, which allows a Lawgiver to lace a target’s food or drink with sedatives or poison. It differs in that onlookers will begin to notice the work of a poisoner as soon as people begin to pass out or drop dead.
