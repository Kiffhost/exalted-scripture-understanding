Lightning arcs across the Dragon-Blood’s weapon as she hones her deadly focus. When she aims at an enemy within close range, she may spend up to (Perception/2, rounded up) [[Initiative]] to gain two motes for each point of [[Initiative]] spent. These motes can only be used to enhance a [[Melee]] attack that benefits from that aim action, and are lost if the Dragon-Blood doesn’t attack the enemy she aimed against on her next turn.
