After launching an opponent with one of the prerequisite Charms, the Solar channels Essence through her arms and legs and rips through the space between, flashing into her opponent to make an additional attack using any Ability and allowing the Exalt to reflexively draw a weapon to do so. When the Exalt uses Lightning Strikes Twice after using one of the prerequisites to unleash a decisive attack, her Initiative does not roll over until after the extra attack has been completed. Making this attack has slightly different effects depending on whether the Charm was triggered with Crashing Wave Throw or Heaven Thunder Hammer: 

### Crashing Wave Throw

The Solar strikes her opponent after he bounces off a hard surface and take damage from Crashing Wave Throw. If the Exalt uses this version of Lightning Strikes Twice, she may meet her falling opponent in the air and make a grapple attack with his Defense set to 0. Succeeding in the roll for clinch control means the Solar must make an immediate throw or slam, hurling her opponent into further hard surfaces or driving him bodily into the ground. 

### Heaven Thunder Hammer

The Solar must knock her foe to short or medium range on the attack in order to use this Charm. Doing so allows her to flash in to range before he impacts, cancelling his impact with scenery to strike him again. In this case, the Solar cannot grapple her opponent, but makes a strike against him as if it were a surprise attack. Using Lightning Strikes Twice counts as the Exalt’s movement action, but note that it’s possible to move several range bands while chaining multiple uses of this Charm. Lightning Strikes Twice can only be used once per combat, but can be reset by gaining 10+ Initiative on a single tick.
