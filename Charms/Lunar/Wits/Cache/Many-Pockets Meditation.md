The Lunar is never caught unprepared. She banishes Elsewhere an item light enough to hold in her hands or wear. Artifacts can only be banished if she’s attuned to them. Ending this Charm recalls the banished item, though the Lunar must still take any actions required to ready it, like donning armor (Exalted, p. 591). She can banish multiple items with multiple uses of this Charm. An Essence 3 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a threemote surcharge to banish an object too large to hold, as long as it could be lifted by a feat of strength with a difficulty no higher than 10. This requires her to spend five minutes concentrating or devising an ingenious hiding place for it, and she can’t banish large objects that aren’t hers.
