*The Solar can unlock the true potential of an artifact.*
Grasping an artifact to which she is attuned, and which is capable of [[Evocations]], the Lawgiver sends her [[Essence]] surging through the relic’s chakras, merging its spirit with her own. Roll the Solar’s ({Intelligence or Wits} + [[Lore]]) against a difficulty of (the object’s rating + 2), or 10 if it’s N/A. If the roll gains at least one success, the Solar automatically unlocks one of the artifact’s [[Evocations]] without spending experience points. If the Solar rolls successes in excess of the difficulty, she unlocks half the extra successes (rounded down) in [[Evocations]]. This Charm may be used once per story, and may not be used again on the same artifact until an amount of experience has been invested in it equal to the cost of the [[Evocations]] that were unlocked for free. The Exalt may not use this Charm to aid another character in awakening [[Evocations]] until she is [[Essence]] 5+. Waive this requirement if [[Lore]] is her Supernal Ability.
