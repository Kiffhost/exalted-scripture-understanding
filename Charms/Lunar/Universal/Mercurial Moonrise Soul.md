The Lunar has mastered her chosen Caste, embodying its archetypal prowess.
The Lunar’s once-per-day anima power resets when she accomplishes something that could earn her Caste’s Role Bonus (Lunars, p. 135), even if she doesn’t receive one.
Additionally, Casteless no longer need to cycle through all three Castes’ powers, although they can’t use the same Caste’s power twice in a row.
