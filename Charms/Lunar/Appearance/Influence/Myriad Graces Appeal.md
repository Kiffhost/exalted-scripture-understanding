When the Lunar stunts to add a second Attribute to her Appearance to determine how many Charm dice she can add on an influence roll and applies a full Excellency, she also adds that Attribute to her base Appearance to determine how many non-Charm bonus dice her Appearance adds (Exalted, p. 218). This canâ€™t raise the Appearance bonus above (higher of Appearance or 5).
