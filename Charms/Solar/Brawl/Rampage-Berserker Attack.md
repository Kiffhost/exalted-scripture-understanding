*The Solar shatters her opponentâ€™s limbs and torso with a barrage of [[Essence]]-fueled blows.*
Roll a normal Brawlbased withering attack, but instead of using extra successes for damage, each extra success determines how many times the Solar strikes her opponent and how many times the damage of her attack is repeated. This attack may only be used once per scene, but if can be reset if the Solar incapacitates a powerful or impressive opponent.
