*Nothing matters.*
The Abyssal makes a special instill roll against a single character, either spoken or written, to corrupt one of his Minor or Major Principles. She must leverage an [[Intimacy]] of at least the same intensity as the one targeted.
If successful, the Abyssal may rewrite the targeted Principle, warping it in a way that expresses the futility of life, the value of death, the inevitability of the end, or similar bleak beliefs. This costs three [[Willpower]] to resist.
This Charm can affect Defining Principles if their object is mortal or if the target shares a Major or Defining Principle with the Abyssal.
## Reset 
This Charm canâ€™t be used against a character more than once per story.
