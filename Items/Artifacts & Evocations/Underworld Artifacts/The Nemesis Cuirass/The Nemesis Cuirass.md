*The people of the Intou Shogunate revered most Dragon-Blooded as bodhisattvas, guiding the faithful towards spiritual purity after death.*
Shahar Yun, however, was reviled, infamous for his vanity and brutality. After his death in an illegal duel, his ghost swore vengeance on his killer’s family. The mortwight slew them to the last, all save his killer, and forged their souls into the Nemesis Cuirass. Spikes and blades festoon the heavy, all-concealing suit of soulsteel plate, along with the snarling faces of gargoyles and grotesques.
When his sworn enemies were dead, his vengeance did not abate. He went on to ravage the Intou Shogunate for denying him the worship and respect he believed was due. The villain's campaign of terror continued for more than a year before the Intou [[Wyld Hunt]] defeated and exorcized his shade. The armor passed into the hands of the ill-fated Dhakal clan, playing a central part in their escalating feud with the Jajars, which later to become the subject of a famous tragedy.
Sometime after the fall of the Intou Shogunate, the Nemesis Cuirass was buried in an unmarked pit in a desolate shadowland, though rumors say it has since been reclaimed by a dark warrior. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[The Nemesis Cuirass]]

[[The Nemesis Cuirass]] draws power from its wearer’s negative Ties, and from weakening their positive Ties. However, Ties of fear don’t benefit any of its [[Evocations]], nor do other negative Ties the [[Storyteller]] deems unsuitable for the armor’s enmity.
The Cuirass’ wearer gains +1 [[Resolve]] against influence that would weaken negative Ties. The armor’s menacing appearance grants its wearer the [[Hideous]] Merit (Exalted, p. 162).
