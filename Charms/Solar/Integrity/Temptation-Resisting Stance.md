The Solar Exalted rise above the poisons of a wicked world. Corruption, lust, and greed; vice and the addictive soulstroking caresses of the raksha—the Lawgivers stand resolute against all such threats. This Charm raises the Exalt’s Resolve by one against all social influence which would tempt her to turn against her Ties or sway her from her Principles. In addition, when multiple Solars working toward the same overall goal in a social scene each activate this Charm, their bonuses stack together, to a limit of five bonus Resolve—the traditional number of Solars in a Circle.
