Embodying the eternal [[Essence]] of the Imperial Mountain, the Dragon-Blood becomes nigh-invincible. She may use this Charm after being hit by a decisive attack or failing a roll to resist an [[Environmental Hazards|environmental hazard]], falling damage, or trap, but before damage is rolled. She rolls (her [[Hardness]]), subtracting one die from the damage roll for each success. This can’t reduce the total dice of damage below half the original number, rounded up (although other defensive effects can subsequently do so).
Additionally, [[uncountable damage]] (Exalted, p. 205) is reduced to 10 dice of decisive damage before the Dragon-Blood rolls her [[Hardness]].
[[Apocalypse-Outlasting Posture]] can only be used once per scene. Using it against [[uncountable damage]] doesn’t require a reset.
