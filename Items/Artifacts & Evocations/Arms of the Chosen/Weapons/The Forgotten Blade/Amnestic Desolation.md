*Technique-Dissociating Stroke The Forgotten Blade’s true master needn’t merely shave slivers from an enemy’s memory; she may sever it at the root.*
This is a difficulty 8 gambit, subtracting the target’s current penalty from [[Elegant Fugue Strike]] from the difficulty. If successful, the target falls unconscious but takes no physical damage. Instead, he suffers total retrograde amnesia, losing all episodic memory of his entire life. The target loses neither Abilities nor [[Intimacy|Intimacies]], though he may forget he has them until reminded by circumstances; Specialties !!pertainingtoindividualpeople,places,things,andideasare!! lost until the amnesia is cured, but broader Specialties remain. The victim regains consciousness if he takes damage. Lost memories do not return naturally. Treat this amnesia as a Defining [[Derangement]] for purposes of healing magic such as [[Soul Projection Method]] or WholenessRestoring Meditation.
