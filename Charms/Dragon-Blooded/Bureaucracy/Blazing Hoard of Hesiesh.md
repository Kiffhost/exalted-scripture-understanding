Flaunting her wealth, the Dragon-Blood cows those beneath her into submission. She gains (her Resources − target’s Resources) non-Charm bonus dice on instill, persuade, and threaten rolls made with any Ability. This bonus doesn’t stack with any bonus dice from her Appearance (Exalted, p. 218). If the Dragon-Blood uses Shells-for-Silver Ruse to increase her apparent Resources, this increases her rating, up to a maximum of Resources 6, for this Charm’s purposes.
