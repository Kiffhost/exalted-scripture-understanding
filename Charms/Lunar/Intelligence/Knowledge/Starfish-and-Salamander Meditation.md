Gifted with supernatural brilliance, the Lunar knits together maimed flesh, revives withered organs, and even shapes new limbs. She undertakes an extended (Intelligence + Medicine) action to heal a crippling effect, or a similar physical malady such as congenital blindness or sterility. This has a one-month interval, difficulty 5, and a goal number and terminus based on the treated effect’s severity: goal number 20 and no terminus for effects comparable to a crippling injury that can be accepted to negate one or two levels of damage (Exalted, p. 201); goal number 40 and terminus 15 for those comparable to a three- or four-level injury; or goal number 60 and terminus 10 for those comparable to a five-level injury. She must spend at least a week tending to her patient for each interval, though this can be sped with Flesh-Sculpting Art. Success fully mends the treated debility. On failure, the Lunar can’t attempt to heal the same injury again.
