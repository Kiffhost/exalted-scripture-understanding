*The Abyssal’s shadowy network of underlings and catspaws draws the wicked and the damned into her service.*
The Abyssal rolls ([Charisma, [[Intelligence]], or Manipulation] + [[Bureaucracy]]), doubling 9s. Every two successes let her immediately gain one dot of [[Followers]] or [[Retainers]]. The characters these [[Merits]] represent are recruited into the Abyssal’s organization. She can specify her requirements of the characters she recruits in detail; if any recruits that match her description exist to be recruited, her agents will find them.
At the end of the story, the [[Merits]] are lost as the recruited characters move on from the organization, unless the [[Storyteller]] deems that the Abyssal’s treatment of them qualifies to retain them long-term as Story [[Merits]] (Exalted, p. 158).
With [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal can also use this Charm to gain [[Allies]], [[Contacts]], [[Cult]], and Mentors.
