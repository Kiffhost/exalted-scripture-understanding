*With a sharp, keening paean to the obsidian-eyed prophet Azet-Ithey, the necromancer conjures a shadow of his wretched scythe, cutting down hope and joy like dry grass.*
The necromancer rolls (Wits + Occult) against the Resolve of all enemies within close range as she swings a spectral scythe. Victims find their minds torn to gore and ribbons.
Each affected character must weaken one of their positive Intimacies (necromancer’s Essence) times. The weakened Intimacies cannot be strengthened for the rest of the story.
If a character has no positive Minor Intimacies remaining, he can pay one Willpower instead of weakening a Major or Defining Intimacy. Victims also suffer a deep depression, adding (necromancer’s Essence/2) non-Charm Resolve against influence to instill positive Intimacies or inspire positive feelings.
The necromancer may choose to crystallize the scythe after her swing, wielding it as a grimscythe (Exalted, p. 597) for the rest of the scene. Against characters affected by its initial summoning, she adds (Essence) dice of post-soak damage to withering attacks. Once per scene, she can use her Initiative in place of the normal dice pool for an instill roll to weaken an Intimacy or an inspire roll to spread feelings of despair against targets within close range, momentarily changing the scythe into a reaping shadow that cuts the heart instead of the body.
## Control
The sorcerer may retain the scythe indefinitely, but while she sleeps, she doesn’t regain Willpower — her dreams are torn to ribbons by its cruel edge. She may awaken Evocations for the scythe, drawing on its power to cleave hopes, its partially immaterial nature, and the mythos of itinerant Azet-Ithey, who wanders the Underworld enforcing his edict against the blasphemy of joy.
## Distortion (15)
The victim reduces the penalty imposed by this spell by two and can regain lost Intimacies, though never beyond Minor intensity. If directed against a necromancer wielding the grimscythe itself, distortion instead reduces its attributes to a mundane scythe (Exalted, p. 584) until dismissed.
