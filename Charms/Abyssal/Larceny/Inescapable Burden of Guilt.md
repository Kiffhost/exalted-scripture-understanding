*The Abyssal frames another for her wicked deeds, consigning the innocent to the magistrate’s judgment and the gallows’ finality.*
When the Abyssal makes a conceal evidence roll, she arranges the scene such that the evidence appears to implicate a specific character she’s aware of rather than the actual culprit. An investigator who fails his case scene roll believes he’s succeeded but receives a false clue that points him towards the framed character. Even a successful roll turns up the false clue the Abyssal planted in addition to the actual evidence. A successful investigator is aware of the discrepancy but not of which piece of evidence is true.
