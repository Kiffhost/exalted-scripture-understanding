*Woe to those dishonor their pacts with Death’s Lawgiver, for their sins cannot be kept hidden.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm when someone makes a promise to her or commits to an agreement with her, forging a bond between them. If the deathknight has a Lunar mate, she can do so for promises made to him in her presence. Should the target break his word, the Abyssal immediately senses his betrayal. She discerns the general circumstances and context of the violation, and she gets a general sense of direction toward the location where it took places. If she’s been there before, she identifies its exact location. For the rest of the story, she doubles 8s on [[Perception]] rolls to find the offender.
A [[Moonshadow]] Caste waives this Charm’s cost if she uses it together with her oathbinding anima power.
