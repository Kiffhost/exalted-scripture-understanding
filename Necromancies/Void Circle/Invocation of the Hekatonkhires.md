*Forging the Old Laws into unbreakable chains, the necromancer draws forth one of the ancient horrors of the Underworld to pact with her and serve her will.*
This spell conjures forth one of the Underworld’s behemoths after a grueling twelve-hour ritual conducted in a place touched by death, anchoring the behemoth to the necromancer’s soul. It cannot harm her or her allies and gains an inviolate Major Tie of deference to the necromancer, serving for (necromancer’s Essence) weeks before returning to the Underworld. It performs inconvenient tasks at her request but may demand a suitable prize or pact for serious or life-changing tasks (Exalted, p. 216). Promises that either party makes under the auspices of this spell are sanctified by the same power as a Moonshadow Caste’s Keeper of the Old Laws power (p. XX). Common boons they request include
- A minor sacrifice (p. XX) in its honor, especially one befitting their nature.
- A Major Stigmata (p. XX), which it inflicts on the necromancer, marking her with a bit of its mien and nature.
- Promises to support it in pursuing its ghostly passions.
The necromancer may seize hold of the bindings created by this spell to compel the behemoth to act on her commands without making a bargain, but doing so is difficult. While meditating, she rolls (Intelligence + Occult) against the higher of the behemoth’s Essence or Resolve. Success lets her pay one Willpower to possess the behemoth from any distance, commanding it as she might her own body. Compelling actions that would violate one of the behemoth’s Minor or Major Intimacies requires another roll against its Resolve.
The necromancer can’t force it to take actions that would violate a Defining Intimacy. She may control the behemoth for as long as she meditates. The behemoth cannot form or strengthen negative Ties towards the necromancer until it is released from the spell.
A necromancer cannot summon more than one behemoth at a time through this spell.
## Control
The necromancer may commune with her behemoth as long as they are both within the same realm of existence, meditating to share its senses without needing to roll or spend Willpower to possess it. She senses the presence of Underworld behemoths within (Essence x10) miles, contesting stealth with (Perception + Occult), and gains (Essence) non-Charm dice to read intentions and profile character actions against them. When she binds a behemoth with this spell, she always takes a Major Stigmata, reflecting its nature as she opens her soul to it more fully than other necromancers.
