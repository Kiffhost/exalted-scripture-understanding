*The Dragon-Blood makes no distinction between dance hall and field of battle.*
She adds ([[Performance]]) bonus dice to any combat movement roll. Additionally, she can flurry the supplemented movement with a [[Performance]]-based action without flurry penalties. This Charm canâ€™t be used if the Exalt is wearing medium or heavy armor. In Wood Aura, this Charm also adds a non-Charm bonus success on the roll, and allows the Dragon-Blood to ignore the normal penalties for moving through difficult terrain.
