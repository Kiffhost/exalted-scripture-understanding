The Lunar cuts through steel like rice paper. Her withering attack ignores half an enemyâ€™s armor soak. If she damages him, his onslaught penalty subtracts from his armor [[Hardness]] until his next turn. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack against a crashed enemy.
