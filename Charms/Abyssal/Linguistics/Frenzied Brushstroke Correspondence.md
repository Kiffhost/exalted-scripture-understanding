*Where the deathknight’s brush strikes paper, words flow like bloodstains, only half-formed before she moves to the next.*
The Abyssal writes with superhuman speed. She can compose a brief note almost instantly, a full-page letter or poem in seconds, or a multiple-page letter or short story in minutes. It’s of little use in writing longer works, as it doesn’t speed the Abyssal in composing her writing. When used to copy an existing text, she can transcribe a large book in a day, or a document that would take hours to copy in a matter of minutes.
