Fate bears the Sidereal’s gifts to their intended recipients — and with them, whatever blessings or curses she sees fit to impose. The Sidereal rolls (Intelligence + Craft) to introduce a fact about how someone she’s interacted with in the last day will come into possession of something she’s created, or how it will arrive at a location she’s familiar with. This has difficulty 1-10 depending on how unlikely the Sidereal’s proposed fact is. If successful, fate ensures this course of events happens, or something extremely close: a pickpocket lifts a ring off the Sidereal only to be caught by its intended recipient; storm winds blow a letter off the Sidereal’s desk and carry it to the recipient; a passing eagle somehow drops a sword into a Circlemate’s hand. When the object arrives, the Sidereal gains craft points as per completing a basic project (Exalted, p. 240). If it was sent to a person, she can reflexively use an Ascending (Caste) Horoscope or Descending (Caste) Horoscope on him. Sidereals can use this Charm to leave bequests for their next incarnation once they Exalt: artifacts, finery, messages, or whatever else they deem appropriate.
