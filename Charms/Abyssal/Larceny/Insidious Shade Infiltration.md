*The Abyssal moves as a shadow, seeping through the barred gates that protect the living from horrors such as her.*
The Abyssal moves through a doorway, window, portcullis, grate, or similar opening as if it wasn’t there. In combat, this uses a reflexive move action.
With an Essence 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can use this Charm to pass through any barrier, not just doors and similar openings. If she uses it on multiple consecutive turns, she waives the Willpower cost of all uses past the first. Obstructions that span more than a single range band, like a fortified city’s walls, require multiple uses of this Charm, one for each range band. While moving through such obstructions, the deathknight gains the benefits of full cover (Exalted, p. 199), though appropriate magic or stunts might circumvent this. If she doesn’t renew this Charm at the start of her turn while doing so, she’s ejected from the barrier at the point she entered it.
