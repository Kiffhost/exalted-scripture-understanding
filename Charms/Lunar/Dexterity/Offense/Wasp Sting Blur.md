*The Lunar’s predatory instincts seize on a flaw in her prey’s defense, striking with lightning speed.* 
She makes an attack with (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) bonus dice. If this crashes her target or deals 3+ decisive damage, she reflexively makes a decisive attack against him. She rolls damage equal to the target’s current onslaught penalty — counting onslaught inflicted by the initial attack (but not by itself) — and ignores [[Hardness]]. This doesn’t include the Lunar’s [[Initiative]] or reset it. 
If the Lunar’s initial attack incapacitates her target, she makes the reflexive attack against another enemy in range. It still uses her initial target’s onslaught penalty to determine damage.
