The character’s body is toxic in some way. This poison is equivalent to snake venom (p. 234), and the character is naturally immune to his own toxin.
For one dot, the character’s blood is poisonous, and must be ingested to inflict damage.
For two dots, all of the character’s bodily fluids are poisonous, and can be applied through ingestion or intimate contact.
For five dots, the character’s blood becomes a contact poison.
Anyone inflicting two or more levels of lethal damage on the character with a single attack, or grappling him when he has suffered lethal damage during the scene, must make a difficulty 3 ([[Wits]] + [[Dodge]]) roll to avoid being poisoned.
### Drawback
This Merit tends to be its own drawback, since it can’t be turned off.
