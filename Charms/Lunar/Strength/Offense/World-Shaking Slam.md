When she knocks a foe prone or moves him between range bands with a decisive attack — such as a slam or a smash attack — she also treats the damage roll as a feat of strength to push or destroy whatever he impacts (including the ground or floor). She can instantly complete feats that would normally take minutes. Success also deals (feat’s minimum Strength/2, rounded !!up)diceofbashingdecisivedamage,ignoringHardness.!! An [[Essence]] 2 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a threemote surcharge to trap an enemy with a successful feat, burying him beneath the remnants of whatever object he struck or otherwise restraining him. He suffers the effects of being grappled (Exalted, p. 200) until he or an ally succeeds on a feat of strength to free him, with a difficulty of (Lunar’s feat’s minimum Strength/2, rounded up).
