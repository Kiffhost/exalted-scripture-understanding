The Council of the Empty Throne appointed the mortal Tepet Fokuf as Regent of the Scarlet Throne, a compromise choice acceptable to every Great House except his own. While his kin pride themselves on honor and military acumen, Fokuf is an embarrassment of a man, lacking ambition and talent. He wasn’t always so, but it’s said that his failure to Exalt broke his will and pride. 

Neither Fokuf nor anyone else in the Realm indulges the idea that he’s anything but a figurehead, holding a post that exists solely to leverage authority traditionally vested in the Empress alone. He speaks with senators and prominent Dynasts a few minutes each day, and issues whatever decrees they support. He spends most of his time in his bedchamber in the Imperial Palace, masturbating to passages of the Immaculate Texts that concern lovemaking and eroticism. While the Mouth of Peace has endorsed the act as a sincere, if peculiar, show of devotion, she privately despises the Regent — a mere mortal given authority over the enlightened Dragon-Blooded, in violation of the Perfected Hierarchy — and longs for the day he dies. The peasantry express their contempt more openly, muzzled only by the laws against lèse-majesté; should widespread peasant revolts arise, deposing the Regent will doubtlessly be a central rallying cry. 

Only once has Fokuf dared sit on the Scarlet Throne. Whether the intertwined jade dragons that form the throne actually came to life and rejected him, or whether the pressures of rule simply proved too much for him, none can say for sure.
