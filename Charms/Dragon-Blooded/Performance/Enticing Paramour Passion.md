*The flames of passion nourish the seeds of lasting relationships, be they bonds of pure-hearted love or rivalries of hatred and attraction.*
To use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must engage a character in a voluntary act of physical [[intimacy]] — sex, a kiss, a passionate embrace — after successfully seducing him with an influence roll of any Ability, or being seduced by his own influence roll. She stocks a pool of non-Charm dice equal to (her [[Appearance]] + her positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the target + his positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her). She may add up to ([[Essence]]) non-Charm dice from this pool on:  
- [[Influence]] rolls made with any Ability against the target alone that inspire an emotion, or instill or leverage a [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the Dragon-Blood.
- Read intentions or profile character rolls against the target.
- [[Resolve]] or [[Guile]] against the target, raising it by +1 for every two dice she expends.
- Rolls to introduce or challenge facts related to the target.
- Strategic Maneuver rolls against the target.
This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal or accomplishing a legendary social goal by seducing someone.
