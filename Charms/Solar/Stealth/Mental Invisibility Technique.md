The surreptitious Exalt may even hide in the spaces between thoughts. Roll the Exalt’s ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) against her subject’s [[Resolve]]. On a success, she vanishes from her subject’s notice, and cannot be perceived. This effect applies to every witness whose [[Resolve]] is surpassed by the Solar’s skill. Not even overt action can reveal the Exalt to those affected by [[Mental Invisibility Technique]]. The Lawgiver may step out of her coat in a snowstorm or leap to the rooftops from the street without being noticed. However, rolling [[Join Battle]] or taking violent action ends this Charm’s effects. Additionally, subjects may spend one [[Willpower]] to break free of the Solar’s deception if the Exalt’s presence is pointed out to him, the Solar intentionally reveals herself to him, or the Exalt attempts to harm or steal something he values at the level of a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]].
