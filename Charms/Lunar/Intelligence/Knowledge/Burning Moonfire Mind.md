Evincing divine genius, the Lunar beckons forth secret power. She rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [Integrity, [[Lore]], or Occult]), banking motes equal to her successes. These can only be spent on mental Attribute [[Charms]] that enhance [[Bureaucracy]], [[Craft]], [[Integrity]], [[Investigation]], [[Lore]], [[Medicine]], or [[Occult]] rolls, or [[Resolve]]. Alternatively, they can be added as sorcerous motes to any spell she shapes. These motes are lost if not spent by scene’s end. This Charm can only be used once per day, unless reset by rolling 5+ successes with [[Dreaming Wisdom Revelation]].
