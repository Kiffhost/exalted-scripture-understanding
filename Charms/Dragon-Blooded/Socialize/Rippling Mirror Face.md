*The sparkling waters of the sunlit ocean conceal dark depths, hidden beneath blinding reflections.*
The Dragon-Blood may use this Charm when she asserts her [[Guile]] against a read intentions roll. If that roll fails, the opposing character believes he succeeded. Instead of revealing the truth, the Dragon-Blood may choose an [[Intimacy]] possessed by any character present in the scene that sheâ€™s previously discerned with her own read intentions action, passing it off as her own. In Water Aura, this Charm may be declared after a character has failed a read intentions roll, rather than before he rolls. Stealth
