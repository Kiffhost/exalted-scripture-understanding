*Drawing [[Stormcaller]] with the tempered will of a saint or the killing intent of a devil, the wielder unleashes a devastating storm on a nearby area — hurricanes, blizzards, floods, tsunamis.*
To use this Evocation, the wielder must first spend a scene in meditation, honing her intentions, before drawing the blade. The Storyteller can use the effects of [[Rain of Doom]] (Exalted, p. 483) to represent the devastation wrought by Stormcaller’s ultimate storm, or create a unique effect. 
As long as the wielder has attended to the daiklave’s purification dutifully for the past year, she can ensure the storm won’t harm her Circlemates or any characters she has a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards. However, if she has lapsed in purifications, has an [[Intimacy]] that she formed through interaction with the bound demon, or is in [[Limit Break]], the storm rages out of her control, often inflicting unimaginable collateral damage. 
This Evocation can only be used once per story. The Solar may reset it when she upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] by successfully purifying [[Stormcaller]] beneath the new moon. Alternatively, she may reset it by communing with Akavadra in a scene of meditation, accepting a Major [[Intimacy]] that represents the demon’s corrupting influence — chosen by the Storyteller — in exchange for resetting this Evocation. The [[Dawn]] Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation can only be awakened by a wielder who has proven her will superior to that of Akavadra, forcing the storm demon to acknowledge her as his master. This is normally done by succeeding on the [[Occult]] roll to purify the blade for every consecutive new moon over the course of a full year, though other narrative conditions may allow the wielder to assert her primacy over the demon. 
Alternatively, the storm demon might choose to make this Evocation available to a warrior who earns her favor through great and heartless deeds of violence.
