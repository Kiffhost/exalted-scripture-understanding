*Too much depends on the Sidereal for her to let herself die.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm after being hit by an attack but before the damage roll, adding +1 target number on that roll. Uncountable damage is negated instead.
Against a recurring source of uncountable damage, she’s also rendered immune for the scene.
With a Resistance 5, Essence 3 repurchase, if the Sidereal’s unarmored, she may pay a one-Willpower surcharge to add +2 target number.
