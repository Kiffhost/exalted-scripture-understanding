*The Dragon-Blood sparks outrage with her diatribe.*
She rolls ([[Charisma]] + [[Linguistics]]) as a written influence roll targeting a specific character. If she beats his [[Resolve]], her words provoke him to react with hostility and argument regardless of what the message actually says — either by seeking the author out in person, or by sending a written response. This influence doesn’t compel the target to endanger himself or escalate to violence, although he may well do so of his own accord. Resisting requires entering a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and calling on a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]]. If the Dragon-Blood knows [[Signature-Stealing Calligraphy]] (p. 209), she may use it reflexively alongside this Charm to write a letter under another person’s identity, rolling with ([[Manipulation]] + [[Linguistics]]) instead. As long as the target is convinced by her forgery, he’ll pursue whoever the message is attributed to. If he sees through the forgery, the influence is overturned.
