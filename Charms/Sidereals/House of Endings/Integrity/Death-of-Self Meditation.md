*The Sidereal kills that part of herself that would betray her duty, even if she must cut away all that she is.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm after an influence roll beats her [[Resolve]], recreating her personality to negate it. She gains a Defining [[Intimacy]], chosen by her player, that renders that influence unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). She also gains a number of Major [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] equal to the influence’s [[Willpower]] cost, chosen by the Storyteller, reflecting changes in personality and eccentricities caused by the mental alterations necessary to negate the influence. Any [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] that support the influence are lost. [[Influence]] rolls to instill them again use the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221) for the rest of the story. The Sidereal can’t voluntarily strengthen them until they’ve been instilled by influence. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by upholding one of [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] imposed by this Charm.
