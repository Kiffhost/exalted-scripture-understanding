*The Infernal is beloved by all things made in the Demon Sea’s image, embraced by the ocean’s depths and caressed by poison flowing through her veins.*

The Infernal can breathe water and other liquids as if they were air. She’s immune to any deleterious effects from being exposed to or submerged in water or the acidic sea of Kimbery. She adds (Sail/2, rounded up) dice on rolls with any Ability against other liquid environmental hazards and poisonous liquids.

This protection includes possessions on the Infernal’s person. They can’t be damaged by water or the Demon Sea and are substantially more durable against liquid-based hazards — if Infernal manages to survive swimming through a lake of magma, her gear would remain usable. Ships that the Infernal pilots can’t be harmed by the Demon Sea’s waters.

With Essence 2, this Charm’s duration becomes Indefinite.
## [[Keys]]
#### Great Mother’s Mercy (Sail 4, Essence 2) (+2m)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote surcharge to use this Charm on a touched character that she has a positive Tie toward, conferring the same benefits on him. She can also use it on an object, protecting it as if it were on her person. The object can’t be larger than she can hold or carry on her person. The Infernal can stack multiple uses of this Charm to affect any number of targets.
#### Demon Sea’s Embrace (Sail 4, Essence 2)
If the Infernal has a positive Tie toward her target (herself included), this Charm’s cost is reduced by (Intimacy) motes, minimum zero.
#### Sea-Sheltered Devil Hull (Sail 5, Essence 3, [[#Great Mother’s Mercy (Sail 4, Essence 2) (+2m)|Great Mother’s Mercy]]) (+6m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses this Charm aboard a ship, extending its protection to all characters aboard as long as she’s piloting the vessel. Any Hull damage it takes from hazardous liquids is reduced by (Essence/2, rounded up) levels.
