*The Devil-Prince’s blade enters flesh easily and perfectly, carving promises of forthcoming terror into the body of her victim.*

The stylist adds one die of damage on a decisive attack, or (Intimacy + 1) against enemies with [[Devil-Prince Sword Style#Craven Intimacies|craven intimacies]]. If she deals damage, her target’s wound penalty is increased by one and penalizes his soak until the end of the scene as a crippling effect.

This Charm can enhance gambits made with [[Finger-Stealing Feint]], adding its damage bonus to the Initiative roll and inflicting its crippling effect if it deals damage.
