Created from the sap of a vine from the jungles of the Far East and the poison of a species of clam from the Southwest coasts, this drug is sold as small packets of dark red powder. When mixed with water or wine, it creates a brew that slows aging. Anyone taking weekly doses of age-staving cordial will live 25 percent longer than someone who doesn’t have regular access to the drug. Other anagathics are similarly expensive and difficult to procure.
