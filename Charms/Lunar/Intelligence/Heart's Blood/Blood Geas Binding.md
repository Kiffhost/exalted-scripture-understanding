The Lunar stands witness to pacts that bind families and nations, a sacred monster empowered to enact awful vengeance on oathbreakers. When she perceives a human making a promise to her or swearing a vow with the intent that she’ll be a witness to it, she may sanctify that oath. If he breaks his oath, the Lunar is alerted to this by a spike of rage, and claims his shape as per a sacred hunt. This Charm can’t seal oaths made specifically to let oath-givers easily grant the Lunar their shapes by breaking them. 

## Special activation rules

If the Lunar’s Solar mate seals an oath using his anima power, she waives this Charm’s Willpower cost, and may use it on that oath even if it’s not made to or by her.
