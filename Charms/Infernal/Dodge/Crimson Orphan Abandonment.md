*The Infernal outpaces her inner demons, trailed by screaming afterimages of crimson wind.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after an attack against her to splinter off an afterimage. Each 1 on the opposing attack roll lets her create an additional afterimage for three motes each. She can have up to (Stamina or Wits) total afterimages, including from multiple uses of this Charm.

The Infernal can expend an afterimage after an attack roll, including the one she used this Charm in response to. The attacker rerolls a single successful die, starting with 7s and going up. She can only spend one afterimage per attack, but the attacker must reroll an additional die for each other afterimage she has.
## Keys
#### Twins Shed Like Blood
When the Infernal takes decisive damage, she can expend all of her afterimages to reduce it by that many levels. If she takes no damage from an attack, she counts as having dodged it.
