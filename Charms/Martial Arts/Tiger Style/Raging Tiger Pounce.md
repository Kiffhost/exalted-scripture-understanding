A downward claw strike shatters the pillar of an enemy’s balance, sending him sprawling to the ground—exactly where the martial artist wants him. An enemy damaged by the Raging Tiger Pounce is knocked prone. As long as he remains in close range to the martial artist, he must pay two points of Initiative to take a rise from prone action. The martial artist gains these points of Initiative if she has Tiger Form active. 

## Mastery

Raging Tiger Pounce can also be used to supplement any attack against a prone enemy, rendering it undodgeable. The brutal impact of a successful withering hit on a prone target inflicts one die of bashing damage that ignores hardness, or the Charm adds one success to the damage roll of a decisive attack.
