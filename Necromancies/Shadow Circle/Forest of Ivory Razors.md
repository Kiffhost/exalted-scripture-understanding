*The necromancer draws a pair of gruesome bone-knives from her own hands. Where she casts them, they sprout into thickets of jagged ivory.*
After casting this spell to create the bone knives, the necromancer may reflexively toss one of them on her turn to a point within (higher of [[Thrown]] or 3) range bands. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round, but she can only do so once per turn.
The area out to short range from the knife erupts with a thicket of razor-sharp bones as an environmental hazard (difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round). This provides heavy cover to those within or on the other side of the thicket. In subsequent rounds, characters only suffer this hazard if they take an action to move through the affected area. The blades are sharper than reality, allowing them to damage dematerialized creatures.
If a thicket causes at least three levels of damage, the blood nourishes them to take root, making them a permanent feature of the landscape; otherwise, they crumble after a day. The necromancer is immune to the spell’s perils; the bones bend and blunt around her to grant safe passage.
While leading a [[battle group]], the necromancer may pay this spell’s [[Willpower]] cost to grant her side the benefits of the fortification stratagem, in addition to whatever plans her general might employ.
## Control
Bones begin to grow in the necromancer’s presence, budding off into skeletal trees and vines of hanging tarsals. After casting this spell, she may reflexively conjure additional bone-knives for five motes, and her thickets are automatically permanent.
## Distortion (10)
A thicket within medium range begins to shrink back into the soil, reducing its difficulty and Damage by two each and its cover to light. While distorted, the necromancer is no longer immune to her own hazard.
