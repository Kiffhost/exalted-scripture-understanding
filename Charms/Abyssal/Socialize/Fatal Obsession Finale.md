*No matter how fascinating the deathknight may find her prey, all things must someday end in blood.*
When the Abyssal rolls [[Join Battle]] against a character she’s used [[Passion-and-Obsession Puppet]] on, she gains the following advantages:
 - She adds a free full [[Abyssal Excellency|Excellency]] and ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice on the [[Join Battle]] roll.
 - If her [[Join Battle]] rolls beats his and she uses her first turn to attack him, it becomes an [[ambush]] (Exalted, p. 203). If she makes the attack while hidden, it doesn’t break her [[Rules Reference/Combat/Stealth|concealment]].
 - She adds ([[Intimacy]]) to her base [[Initiative]] when she resets after landing a [[Attack#decisive|decisive attack]] against him.
 - His [[Attack#withering|withering attacks]] can’t reduce her below [[Initiative]] 1 unless her [[Initiative]] was lower than his when he attacked. He still gains all [[Initiative]] from withering damage rolls against her.
 - If her target’s base [[Guile]] is lower than his base [[Defense]], her [[Attack#hit roll|attack rolls]] against him add dice equal to the difference.
## Reset 
The Abyssal can only use this Charm against a character once per story unless reset when he believes he’s safe from her as a result of her social influence or underhanded trickery.
