Lunars’ [[Charms]] can temporarily grant or suppress the [[Giant]] mutation (Exalted, p. 161). If a character loses [[Giant]], damage contained in its −0 level goes with it. If she regains [[Giant]], that damage remains in that health level. Natural or magical healing still apply to this damage while [[Giant]] isn’t active. The same is true for other effects that work similarly, such as combining [[Changing Phases Transformation]] and [[Ox-Body Technique]].
