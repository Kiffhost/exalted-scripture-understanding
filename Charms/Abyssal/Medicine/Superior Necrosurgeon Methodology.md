*The Abyssal necrosurgeon settles for nothing less than perfection, endlessly reconstructing and refining her grisly creations.*
The Abyssal surgically enhances a zombie or other reanimated corpse over the course of an hour. This confers one of the following benefits
- +1 die to all Strength-based dice pools and raw withering damage. An undead can only receive this benefit once.
- +1 die to all Dexterity-based dice pools. An undead can only receive this benefit once.
- +1 die to all Stamina-based dice pools and +1 soak. An undead can only receive this benefit once.
- A −4 health level. An undead can only receive this benefit (higher of Abyssal’s Essence or 3) times.
This can’t increase dice pools above 14 dice.
With Occult 5, the Abyssal can use this Charm on ghosts, surgically modifying their corpus.
