The dancer strikes her enemy’s legs out from under him with a series of sweeping kicks. An enemy that takes 5+ withering damage or 1+ decisive damage rolls (Dexterity + Athletics) at difficulty (stylist’s Strength), falling prone on failure. Alternatively, waive a smash attack’s Initiative cost and Defense penalty. If an enemy hit by this attack rises from prone or disengages on his next turn, he loses one Initiative, which the dancer gains. 
## Mastery

If the dancer’s attack is unexpected, or she stunts with a description of how the environment conceals her footwork, she inflicts a −2 penalty on her enemy’s (Dexterity + Athletics) roll; if it’s an ambush, he automatically fails.
