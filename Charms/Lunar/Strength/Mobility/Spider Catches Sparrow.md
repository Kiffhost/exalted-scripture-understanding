Bounding skyward, the Lunar sends foes crashing back to earth. She attacks an airborne enemy at either close or short range above her. If heâ€™s at short range, she reflexively leaps to close range, which counts as her move action. If she crashes him or deals 3+ decisive damage, he falls and lands prone on the ground. Even if he only fell from close range, he suffers falling damage (Exalted, p. 232) as per a short-range fall. The Lunar treats the number of range bands she falls after attacking as one less when calculating her falling damage (Exalted, p. 232).
