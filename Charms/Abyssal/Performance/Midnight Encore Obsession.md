*Though the Abyssal’s performance must die, her audience relives it again and again.*
When the Abyssal makes an [[influence roll]], she adds ([[Essence]]) non-Charm successes. She adds an additional two non-Charm successes for every point of [[Willpower]] spent on other [[Charms]] or other effects that enhance the roll. Resisting it requires entering a Decision Point and citing a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]], and costs three [[Willpower]].
Even if a character does resist, he dreams of the Abyssal the next time he sleeps, entering the Decision Point again. Unless he cites the requisite [[Intimacy]] and spends [[Willpower]], the influence’s effects resume or reoccur, as appropriate. For instance, if the Abyssal instilled a Tie of fascination toward the dead, the target could erode it, but would regain it or strengthen it each night — though not above whatever intensity the deathknight’s influence raised it to.
Once a character has spent [[Willpower]] to resist in (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) separate [[Decision Points]], this Psyche effect ends.
