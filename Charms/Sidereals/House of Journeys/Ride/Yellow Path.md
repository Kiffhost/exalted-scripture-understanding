*The Sidereal sees the shortest path to her goal illumined by a glimmering yellow trail of stardust.*
While traveling along the path revealed by this Charm, the Sidereal, her Circlemates, and up to (Essence) others double the speed at which they travel and gain −1 target number on rolls to forage, find shelter, overcome obstacles, or endure environmental hazards along the way. There’s no guarantee the path will be safe or easy; the Storyteller should choose whatever route and difficulties are best suited to the story.
If the Sidereal has a deadline to get somewhere, she can roll (Wits + Ride) to make it on time no matter what. The roll’s difficulty is 7 if it’s conceivable that the Sidereal could possibly make the deadline on time, no matter how infeasible it may be, or 10 otherwise. She can’t use this Charm more than once per deadline.
This Charm is compatible with all forms of movement, not just mounted travel.
