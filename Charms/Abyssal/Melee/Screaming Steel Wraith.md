*Unleashing one of the wretched souls bound within her blade, the Abyssal strikes with the strength of her victim’s ceaseless suffering.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm after dealing at least one level of withering or decisive damage, unleashing a soul bound with Soul-Drinking Blade to roll (Essence) dice of decisive damage, ignoring Hardness.
The howling shade flees, but rarely finds peace in this freedom, often succumbing to specterhood.
On decisive attacks, this Charm’s cost is paid after the Abyssal’s Initiative resets to base.
## Reset
Once per scene, unless reset by using SoulDrinking Blade to capture a nontrivial enemy’s soul.
