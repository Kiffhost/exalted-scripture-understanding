The Lunar watches over her trusted companions from afar, not with her senses, but with her soul.
The Lunar gains the benefits of Soul’s [[Eclipse]] Unity for someone she has a positive Defining Tie toward. She only needs a Major Tie if her Solar mate has a positive Defining Tie toward that character, or if he belongs to a culture the Lunar has a positive Defining Tie toward or that’s ruled by her Solar mate.
With [[Essence]] 4, this Charm’s cost is reduced to three motes.
