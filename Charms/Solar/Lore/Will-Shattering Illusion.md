Drawing from the deepest well of her existence, the Solar conjures forth a riddle or apparition from her ancient [[Essence]] and channels it against a single target. Roll the Solarâ€™s ([[Wits]] + [[Lore]]) with ([[Essence]]) bonus dice. The successes on this roll create the difficulty of the riddle or illusion posed to her target. The character must answer this effect with his own ([Intelligence or Wits] + [[Lore]]). If he fails the roll, his mind is momentarily shattered, and he loses two points of temporary [[Willpower]]. When done in combat, the target also loses four [[Initiative]], awarded to the Solar. If the target has equal or greater [[Essence]] than the Exalt, the Solar also gains a point of [[Willpower]]. This Charm may be used once per scene.
