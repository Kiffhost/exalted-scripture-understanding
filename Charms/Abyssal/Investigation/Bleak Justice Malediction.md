*The deathknight’s terrible condemnation falls upon all who would lend aid to the guilty.*
When the Abyssal uses Heart-Haunting Condemnation, she can commit its cost indefinitely, causing its curse to slowly spread to everything the offender cares about. When he uses a Tie to an individual to resist the haunting’s influence — either by raising his Resolve or in a Decision Point — the curse spreads to the subject of the Intimacy. If the original roll beats the new victim’s Resolve, they’re cursed with dire misfortunes and hauntings that make clear that the offender is the cause of that character’s woes.
For example, if a swindler draws upon his Intimacy of love for his wife to deny his victims restitution because their relationship rests on the opulent lifestyle he can afford her, his wife may be attacked as his victims converge on their home to retake his ill-gotten wealth. Any who die due to the curse linger as ghosts and haunt the offender as the cause of their misfortune.
