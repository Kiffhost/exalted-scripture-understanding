Leprosy rots the flesh. It begins with fever, aching, and exhaustion. Slowly, over the courses of months, the nerves go dead, wounds fester with infection, and fingers and toes begin to fall off. Itâ€™s not the leprosy itself that kills most victims, but the gangrene that follows. Leprosy is not highly contagious, spreading only through close personal contact. Healers can tend to the diseased with little fear of becoming infected themselves, and the sickness can be contained by isolating lepers in closed communities or colonies.
