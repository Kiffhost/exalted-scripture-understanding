*The Lunar unfolds patagia or lightens her body to swoop gracefully through the air.*
She slows her descent while falling, descending only one range band that round instead of immediately plummeting to the ground. She may move one range band horizontally in the air, which doesn’t count as her move action. Range bands she glides through with this Charm don’t count toward falling damage.
