*Sighting along the flows of Essence that connect her weapon with its mark, the Righteous Devil sends her will down a fine line of possibility, transforming it into inevitability.*
Kiss of the Sun Concentration adds any dice from aiming to the post-soak damage of a withering attack, or converts them to a single die added to the raw damage of a decisive attack. Disarm gambits, or any other gambit that could benefit from superhuman precision, add the full amount of aim dice to their Initiative roll instead of a single die. 
## Mastery
When used with a decisive attack, the full amount of aim dice are added to the raw damage of he attack. Withering attacks and precision-based gambits convert the aim dice to automatic successes on the damage roll.
