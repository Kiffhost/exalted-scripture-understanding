The Sidereal slashes her palm in offering as she recites a promise the Silent Wind once made to Saturn, summoning a portion of the Demon Prince’s apocalyptic presence. The Sidereal summons a deadly vortex within medium range, an environmental hazard extending out to short range from that point with difficulty 4, Damage 4L/round. Demons add +1 target number on rolls against it and are destroyed permanently if incapacitated. All sound is silenced within the vortex. Those outside it can’t hear anything from within; those within it can’t hear at all. This wind is a portion of Adorjan; while she can’t control it, she perceives the world through it. Sidereals are encouraged to exercise great discretion in what information they expose with this Charm. Adorjan may fall in love with Sidereals who summon her, though such attachments are fleeting.
