The manifest expression of the Great Curse. [[Limit Break]] may or may not manifest immediately; the Great Curse is insidious, and tends to erupt into full bloom only when the Exalt’s actions have the potential to create significant turmoil or suffering. An Exalt in the midst of an argument with his Circle is likely to experience the full effects of the Great Curse immediately, while one trekking through the vast desert of the South might continue to travel for several days before the effects of his [[Limit Break]] manifest. The timing of such manifestations are ultimately up to the Storyteller. 

# Solar

The precise manifestation the Great Curse takes is known as a Virtue Flaw. Several potential Virtue [[Flaws]] are listed below, and the Storyteller may create new ones as suits the needs of his story. A Solar’s Virtue Flaw isn’t fixed—the Storyteller should choose whichever one is most suited to the character’s current situation or seems like the most dramatic choice. All Virtue [[Flaws]] share the following features:
- Each Virtue Flaw forces the character to act out some kind of behavior that is harmful to those around him or to himself. The behavior enforced by [[Limit Break]] is treated as a Defining Principle, applying a +4 or -3 to the character’s [[Resolve]] against relevant influence rolls and allowing the character to treat certain types of influence as unacceptable.
- In addition, if a character could treat an influence roll as unacceptable due to [[Limit Break]], he must—he does not have the option of letting it be resolved as normal.
- Being in [[Limit Break]] is an intensely emotional experience, a powerful cathartic reaction to whatever stress has driven a character to it—it feels good, or at least necessary, even as it is traumatic. As a result, when a character ends his [[Limit Break]] he resets his [[Willpower]] points to equal his permanent [[Willpower]], regardless of whether this causes him to gain or lose [[Willpower]].
- Each Virtue Flaw specifies a duration of either session or scene. Those that have a session-long duration last for the remainder of the session of play. If the [[Limit Break]] occurs towards the end of the session, or there isn’t an opportunity for it to have any impact on the game, the Storyteller may choose to have it spill over into the next session as well. Those that have a scene-long duration last for a single scene of play. In addition, each [[Limit Break]] has a condition which can end it prematurely if met.
- Once a [[Limit Break]] ends, the character loses all points of accumulated [[Limit]].

# Lunar

When the Lunar reaches [[Limit]] 10, she’s overtaken by a Monstrous Urge. This may occur immediately or be delayed until a suitable moment, at the Storyteller’s discretion. The Storyteller can choose a Monstrous Urge from those below or create a new one, although she should discuss the choice with the Lunar’s player to ensure it sets the Lunar up for dramatic moments and character development. All Monstrous Urges share the following features:
- Each compels the Lunar to behave in a certain way. This counts as a Defining [[Intimacy]].
- If the Lunar’s Monstrous Urge could let her treat influence as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220), she must do so.
- Each Monstrous Urge lasts either for one scene or one session but may end early if a specific condition is met. If a Monstrous Urge occurs towards a scene or session’s end and wouldn’t have an opportunity to impact the game, the Storyteller can have it spill over into the next scene or session.
- Once a Monstrous Urge ends, the Lunar’s current [[Willpower]] resets to a value equal to her permanent [[Willpower]].
- Once a Monstrous Urge ends, the Lunar’s [[Limit]] resets to 0.

# Sidereal

When a Sidereal reaches [[Limit]] 10, she succumbs to Celestial Hubris. This may occur immediately or later at a suitable moment, at the Storyteller’s discretion. The Storyteller chooses a Celestial Hubris from those below or creates a new one; she should discuss this with the Sidereal’s player to ensure it sets up dramatic moments and character development he’s interested in.
Celestial Hubris works as follows:
- A Sidereal’s Celestial Hubris counts as a Defining [[Intimacy]]. If it would let her treat influence asunacceptable (Exalted, p. 220), she must do so.
- Celestial Hubris lasts one scene or one session. It may end early if a specific condition is met. If it begins too late to impact the game, the Storyteller can have it spill over into the next scene or session.
- Once Celestial Hubris ends, the Sidereal’s [[Limit]] resets to 0 and her temporary [[Willpower]] resets to equal to her permanent [[Willpower]].
