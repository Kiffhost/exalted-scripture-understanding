It was the Anathema Wilting Taiga who forged Glacial Mantle amid the mountain fastness of the Three Diamonds, but the armor’s boreal power couldn’t temper the young Solar’s impetuous Essence fever. While his early raids proved fruitful, the caught the attention of the Lookhsyan ranger Maheka Katsuro. Far from home, Katsuro turned to a nearby satrapy for aid, joining forces with a Sworn Kinship of Dynasts to prosecute a Wyld Hunt against Wilting Taiga. They ultimately slew the Anathema, but not before Taiga killed Katsuro, impaling him on a spike of ice.
Iselsi Ofava, Peleps Tarik, and Akiyo Valen all coveted the Anathema’s puissant armor, but when Tepet Rekal declared that she would go on a pilgrimage to the River Province to bring Glacial Mantle to the honorable Dragon-Blood’s family, none of her Hearth could disagree with her. Even today, Lookshyans allude to the story of the four Dynasts’ journey as a reminder that the Realm’s Dragons can at times be worthy allies.
Glacial Mantle is a suit of articulated plate forged from blue jade, and inlaid with black jade mined from an underground river and unmelting ice from the North’s far reaches. When attuned, a cape of frost crystallizes across the wearer’s back, displaying the mons of the wearer’s gens or some other personal symbol.
