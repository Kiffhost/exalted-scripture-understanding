*The efficacious dances practiced by demons such as Stanewald, Havgrimur, and other dancers are but steps in a greater mystery, that which the Yozis once danced to the music of the spheres. Mystics and savants who study these efficacious dances can glimpse the greater pattern and find within it the gateway to knowledge. Such studies are not without difficulty and danger: few can imitate the dances performed by the flame-pillar bodies of the Gilmyne, while the dances taught by the demon Stanewald would break the body of a mortal who performed them perfectly.*
