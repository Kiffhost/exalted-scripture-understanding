*The stylist’s movements emulate moonsilver’s fluid and mutable nature, rendering her location indeterminate until she strikes.*
The stylist makes a withering or decisive against an enemy within medium range, appearing within close range of him as she strikes. He rolls (Perception + Awareness) against her attack roll; if he fails, it becomes a surprise attack (Exalted, p. 203). The stylist doesn’t move through the space she crosses, letting her bypass obstacles and hazards. This counts as her movement action.
