*A menagerie of horrors haunts the Abyssal’s dreams, a legion of horrors baying to be unleashed against the world.*
The Abyssal rolls ([Intelligence + [[Lore]]) as she wakes from sleep, bringing one of her nightmares into the world. Her player chooses an animal or a non-sapient undead whose [[Resolve]] is less than or equal to her successes to base the nightmare’s traits on. Animals that would be three-dot familiars (Exalted, p. 161) add +3 [[Resolve]] against this, as do undead with [[Essence]] 2+. Undead with [[Essence]] 4+ can’t be used at all.
Nightmares based on animals are undead, gaining the usual benefits of this, as well as the Blood Scent, Deathly Stench, and Plaguebearer [[Merits]] (Exalted, p. 503). Nightmares based on the undead gain up to five dots of mutations chosen by the Abyssal’s player.
The Abyssal lacks direct control over the nightmare. Instead, the [[Storyteller]] chooses a Defining [[Intimacy]] that reflects the primal emotions and deep-seated fears of the Abyssal’s dreams, which guides the nightmare’s actions. For instance, it might have a Defining Tie of hatred toward an enemy who grievously wounded the deathknight, or a Defining Principle of mindless rage that echoes the Abyssal’s own wrath.
The [[Storyteller]] should choose an [[Intimacy]] that will guide the nightmare to act in the Abyssal’s interests, though not necessarily in the way she expected.
The Abyssal can only have one nightmare unleashed at a time. Using this Charm again causes the previous nightmare to fade away.
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a ten-mote surcharge to gain greater control over her nightmare. She can command it to perform a single task—even a life-changing one—without needing to make an influence roll.
