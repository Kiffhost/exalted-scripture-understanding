Hunting Hawkâ€™s wings burn with lambent [[Essence]] as the Solar unleashes a barrage of midair attacks, their force suspending her aloft so that she does not fall. The Solar may pay three motes to use this Evocation whenever she deploys a storm of rapid [[Archery]] attacks while in midair, such as with [[Revolving Bow Discipline]] or [[Arrow Storm Technique]], so long as the majority of the shots target individuals somewhere below her. For an additional point of [[Willpower]], the Solar may drift one range band away from her targets once her attack resolves, even if she has already used her movement action.
