The Sidereal’s passive stoicism bends the world around her to uphold others’ efforts. When the Sidereal provides passive or unskilled support to another character’s action — bracing against a stone block to provide leverage for his feat of strength, looming threateningly behind him as he makes a threaten roll, providing manual labor in his workshop — she rolls ([[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]). He can use her successes in place of his own. The Sidereal’s aid can’t be noticed. The Sidereal can’t use this Charm if she’s previously attempted the same action this scene. If the character she aids fails, it counts as her failing for any applicable retry conditions.
