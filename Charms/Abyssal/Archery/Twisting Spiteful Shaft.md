*The deathknight’s arrow burrows through her victim’s flesh, boring deeper and deeper towards his heart.*
The Abyssal adds one die of damage to a decisive attack. If it deals 3+ damage, her arrow begins burrowing into her victim. His [[Health Track#wound penalties|wound penalty]] is increased by −1, and he suffers (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) dice of [[Health Track#Lethal|lethal damage]] at the start of each of his turns, ignoring [[Hardness]].
Removing the arrow requires an ([[Wits]] + [[Medicine]]) roll at difficulty (higher of Abyssal’s [[Strength]] or 3), as a [[miscellaneous]] action.
