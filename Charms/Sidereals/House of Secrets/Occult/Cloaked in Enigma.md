*The Sidereal veils herself in the subtlety of the unseen forces she has mastered.*
The Sidereal doesn’t lose sorcerous motes for going a turn without gathering them. When she takes a Shape Sorcery action, she gains +1 Guile until her next turn.
This Charm’s cost is waived while unarmored or wearing the resplendent destiny of a supernatural being, sorcerer, or mysterious sage.
