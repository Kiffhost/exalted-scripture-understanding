*Rending black [[Essence]] and vengeful shades lash out from the deathknight’s strike, cutting distant foes deep.*
The Abyssal makes an attack — withering, decisive, or gambit — against an enemy within short range.
The attack’s range extends to medium with [[Initiative]] 10+ and long at 15+. Decisive attacks ignore [[Hardness]].
## Special activation rules
When the Abyssal uses a [[Melee]] Charm to make a clash or counterattack, she can use this Charm reflexively to enhance that attack’s range.
