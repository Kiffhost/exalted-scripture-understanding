*Gargantuan eyes open in the sky, staring down with eerie, inhuman tranquillity as they go unseen by the lowly masses.*

Demonic eyes open in the sky at long range above the Infernal, spreading out to long range horizontally from the point. They’re only visible to the Infernal and those capable of seeing dematerialized entities. She can shift her perspective to that of the eyes to see the world as if looking down from on high. From this vantage, she adds two automatic successes on Awareness rolls that benefit from her elevated perspective or multiple lines of sight, or three successes to notice or examine anything larger than a person. She ignores penalties that affect only her own line of sight, like blindness or thick underbrush. However, some environmental factors may still obscure the eyes’ sight, and they can’t see through roofs and the like.

The Infernal can reflexively change between this perspective and her own on her turn. Even in her own perspective, she passively taps into the eyes’ senses, adding an automatic success on rolls that benefit from their vantage.

If the Infernal knows [[Burning Obsession Gaze]], the demonic eyes can see through roofs and similar obstructions as long as they’re no more than one range band thick.
