*Hate shelters the Infernal from the wretched, vile universe that wishes to harm her.*

When the Infernal is attacked, she can use a Tie of hatred or a similar emotion that’s applicable to her attacker to bolster her Defense as if it were Resolve. If the Tie isn’t to her attacker individually, the bonus is reduced by one.
## Reset
Once per scene unless reset by upholding a Tie of hatred that applies to any of the Infernal’s enemies.
