Moving with dynamic force, the Lunar interposes herself between her prey and escape. She doubles 9s on a roll opposing a lower-[[Initiative]] enemyâ€™s disengage. If successful, she gains the [[Initiative]] he loses for disengaging. If multiple Lunars use this Charm simultaneously, only the Lunar with the highest roll receives the [[Initiative]]. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Speed Bonuses, the Lunar converts dice equal to that Speed Bonus to successes.
