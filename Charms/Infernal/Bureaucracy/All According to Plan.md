*The Infernal plots schemes within schemes, an ever-branching fractal of infinite complexity.*

The Infernal can use this Charm when she’s faced with a significant challenge, threat, or obstacle. After a scene spent engaging with the business or members of an organization she leads, she reveals a countermeasure prepared in advance with a project (Exalted, p. 226). The project must be one that the organization could feasibly complete in (Essence) weeks based on its nature and resources, and can’t completely resolve the obstacle.

If the Infernal uses this Charm in response to a threat posed by a specific character, she forms a Minor Tie of either love or disgust toward him, depending on whether she considers him a worthy rival. If she already has such a Tie, she gains one Willpower if she successfully overcomes the challenge.

If the organization benefits from [[Inauspicious Benediction of Endeavor]], its time reduction applies when determining how lengthy a task the Infernal can prepare.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal with a bureaucratic project.
### Keys 
#### Aeon-Spanning Mastermind Agenda
The Infernal waives this Charm’s cost and can retroactively accomplish projects that would take up to a year.
#### Infinitely Subtle Intrigue
The Infernal can use this Charm proactively for any feasible project, rather than doing so reactively. She can use a reactive project an additional time per story, or two times at Essence 5.
