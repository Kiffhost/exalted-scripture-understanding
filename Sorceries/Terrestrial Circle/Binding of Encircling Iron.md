*Devised fifty years ago by a rare coalition of Ys sorcerers, this spell has allowed Ysyr’s princes to add Fair Folk slaves to the demons and elementals who toil in their city. The air vibrates with the song of hammer on anvil as blazing Essence condenses around the target. With a forceful gesture, the sorcerer wills the Essence to condense, becoming molten iron.* 
This spell can be cast on a defeated raksha or other creature of the Wyld at up to medium range, rolling ([[Wits]] + [[Occult]]) against (the higher of the target’s [[Resolve]] or [[Essence]]). 
If she succeeds, the iron band condenses around the raksha, becoming a crown, collar, or other ring of her choice; these bindings are unique to the sorcerer, covered in symbols that resonate with her soul. The bindings are completely indestructible to the captured creature, but others may damage them as if they were artifacts.
A bound creature develops a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] of loyalty to the sorcerer for a year and a day; this tie cannot be weakened or altered by any means. At the end of this term, the iron binding falls off and the raksha disappears, reappearing in the nearest place of safety at some point in the next three days.
Sorcerers who know Binding of Encircling Iron as their [[Rules Reference/Sorcery/Sorcery#Control Spell|control spell]] can cause their Wyld servants to [[dematerialize]] into their own bindings. Sorcerer-princes in Ysyr use these as a way of counting coup, ornamenting themselves with ogre-torques and lorelei-bangles. In this state, the target has only a dim awareness of the outside world, but can still be influenced by the sorcerer, reducing his [[Resolve]] by 2. With a thought, the sorcerer may force a raksha to [[materialize]] from within the binding, which reappears on the servant’s form. 
## Distortion
(Goal Number: 9)
A rival sorcerer may loosen the binding, reducing the target’s Tie towards the sorcerer to Minor for ([[Essence]]) minutes.
