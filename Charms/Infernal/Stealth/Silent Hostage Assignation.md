*The Infernal sucks the air from her victim’s lungs, quieting his cries to allow a more intimate moment of violence.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after a decisive unexpected attack, stealing her target’s voice for a number of rounds equal to the levels of damage dealt. He’s unable to speak during this time. The Infernal can speak with his voice, even if her own is silenced by [[Voiceless Terror Wind]].

While using [[Voiceless Terror Wind]], the Infernal can use this Charm on attacks that aren’t unexpected.
## [[Keys]]
#### Herald of Silent Death (Essence 2) (+1wp)
For a one-Willpower surcharge, the Infernal can render her victim completely silent, make it impossible to hear him or any action he takes. This doesn’t silence indirect consequences of his actions, like the sound of breaking glass.
