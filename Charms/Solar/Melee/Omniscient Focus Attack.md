Even gods may be cut by the sharp light of Solar fury. As long as she is gripping her weapon, the Solar feels the slightest movement in the air around her and may react with impossible speed. The Solar may use Fervent Blow to clash an attack she is not aware of; she becomes aware of the attack at the last moment. This Charm also allows her to strike immaterial opponents with a clash. This Charm does not force spirits to materialize, even if the Solar’s attack manages to wound them.

### On Omniscient Focus Attack

I wrote this bonus Charm to give Solar Melee a little more overt supernatural capacity. The Solar can clash an opponent with the hypothetical ability to strike while immaterial. The ability to attack while immaterial is typically a power belonging only to spirits. Omniscient Focus Attack will work on concealed foes as well. For the most part, attacking from concealment reveals the attacker’s location, but if they are using magic to keep this from happening and yet the Solar does a lot of damage or kills them with her clash, the Storyteller should consider them revealed anyway, as the Solar slashes through a grate and blood pours from the place of concealment, or a dead body tumbles down out of a well of perfect shadows.
