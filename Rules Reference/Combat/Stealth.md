Stealth is a powerful advantage in battle, affording the opportunity to strike when an opponent least expects it, or when he doesn’t realize he’s in danger at all. 

All stealth attempts consist of [[Action#Opposed|opposed rolls]], generally ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) against ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]). [[Stealth]] rolls can easily take penalties if the conditions aren’t amenable to sneaking or hiding—dry underbrush, bright light, and scant cover can all make stealth more difficult. Likewise, [[Awareness]] rolls can take penalties due to cluttered or noisy environments (such as market crowds or stormy nights)—Stealth and [[Awareness]] are both very context-governed Abilities. 

Assuming that a character has successfully concealed himself, he may then attempt to make an unexpected attack. Unexpected attacks are either an [[#Ambush]] or a [[#Surprise Attack]]. 
# Ambush
An ambush is defined as an attack against a target completely unaware of the attacker’s presence—generally only possible during the first round of a fight, against a target with a lower [[Initiative]] value than the attacker. An ambush attack completely ignores the target’s [[Defense]]; the target is considered to have [[Defense]] 0 against the attack. 
## Hold at Bay
A permutation of an [[#Ambush]], to hold someone at bay is to succeed at an ambush without attacking, choosing instead to hold the target hostage for a number of rounds. The character points her weapon at her target’s vital organs; the target knows he will suffer a deadly attack if he so much as moves, allowing the character to speak her mind before battle commences.

The character may interrogate, [[threaten]], cajole, or otherwise detain her opponent for a number of rounds equal to the difference in their [[Initiative]]. If the target chooses to struggle or try to escape before these rounds are finished, the character may make an immediate [[Attack#decisive|decisive]] [[#Ambush]] attack against him with onerous results: not only is the target’s [[Defense]] set to 0, but his [[Hardness]] is set to 0 as well, and the attack gains +5 automatic damage. If the character chooses to attack her target before the rounds are up, he may defend normally.

If the target chooses to cooperate, the hostage-taker’s [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]] are at +1, while the target’s are each at -2 until the specified number of rounds have passed. When the hold at bay rounds have passed, if the target has not agreed to surrender, both roll [[Join Battle]] to determine who will act first, with the hostage suffering a -2 penalty to his results. If the hostage-taker wins, she can immediately execute a standard ambush attack.
# Surprise [[Attack]] 
A surprise attack is an attack launched from hiding against an opponent who knows he’s in battle and who is actively on the lookout for attacks, even if he isn’t sure exactly where all of his opponents are at the moment. A target faced with a surprise attack suffers a -2 [[Defense]] penalty against that attack. 

Attempting to re-establish surprise is a combat action that cannot be placed in a [[Flurry]]. 

A character in stealth cannot take [[Attack#Rush|Rush]] actions. If he wants to move normally in combat while maintaining concealment, he must have some adequate place to hide in the spot he’s moving to, and must make another [[Action#Reflexive|reflexive]] ([[Dexterity]] + [[Stealth]]) roll when he moves, to keep from being spotted while moving. If this movement crosses wide-open terrain with no appreciable cover, the [[Stealth]] roll’s penalty climbs from the usual -3 (for attempting stealth while already in combat) to -5.
