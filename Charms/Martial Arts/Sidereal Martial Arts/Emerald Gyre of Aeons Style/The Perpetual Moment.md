*The stylist slows time’s flow, trapping her enemy a halfstep behind her in eternity’s gyre.*
The stylist makes a decisive attack against a lower-Initiative enemy. If its damage equals or exceeds (target’s Integrity or Resistance), he suffers the following effects
- Acting on his turn requires him to flurry to take a single action. He can take actions that couldn’t normally be flurried, like using Simple Charms, but still suffers the penalties for flurrying.
- All of his movement counts as being through difficult terrain.
- His onslaught penalty doesn’t refresh at the start of his turn — instead, it’s reduced by one.
This effect ends at the end of the scene or if the target crashes or incapacitates the stylist.
### Enlightenment
The target’s onslaught penalty doesn’t refresh at all on his turn.
