Rally actions can be taken after an allied [[battle group]] has failed a [[rout]] check, but before *dissolution* occurs (a battle group *dissolves* on its next turn after it fails a rout check). They effectively give a unit a second chance to rally back. A rally action is a ({Charisma or Appearance} + War) roll, against the same difficulty as the failed rout check. If the rally action succeeds, then the targeted battle group recovers as though it had succeeded at its rout check.
