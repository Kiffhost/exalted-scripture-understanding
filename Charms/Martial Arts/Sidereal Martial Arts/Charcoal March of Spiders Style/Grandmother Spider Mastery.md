*A web of endless, invisible filaments surrounds the martial artist as she enters a stance of eightfold victory, seeming to split into many selves as she moves with a speed that transcends space and time.*
The stylist can pay a 15-mote, one-Willpower surcharge when she uses this style’s Form to gain the following benefits
- Her extra Initiative tracks can be crashed normally rather than being lost completely upon crash. The stylist only counts as being crashed for Perilous Charms and other effects if all three tracks are crashed.
- She can flurry this style’s Simple Charms with each other and other actions. This includes flurrying Charms that let her make attacks, but she must use a different Initiative track for each Charm’s attacks.
- When she makes an attack, she may treat herself as being at any point within short range of her actual location for all purposes, including ranged attacks’ Accuracy bonuses, the applicability of cover, whether she is within range for a clash or counterattack, etc. This doesn’t let her attack at extreme range.
- When an enemy makes an attack against her, she may treat herself as being at any point within short range of her actual location for all purposes, including ranged attacks’ Accuracy bonuses, the applicability of cover, whether she is within range for a clash or counterattack, etc. However, she can’t negate an attack outright by “moving” her location to a point beyond its range — in such cases, the attack is still rolled normally.
### Enlightenment
In addition to the above effects, the stylist waives the Willpower cost of this style’s Charms.
