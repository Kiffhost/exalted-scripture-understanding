*The deathknight takes aim at the hated daystar, plunging the battlefield into a night broken only by the dim constellations of the Underworld.*
The Abyssal looses an arrow at the sun, rolling ([[Dexterity]] + [[Archery]]) at difficulty 5. If successful, her projectile implodes, devouring all sunlight. This has the following effects, which last for (1 + extra successes) hours:
 - Darkness blankets the battlefield, extending out to ([[Essence]] + 3) range bands from the Abyssal’s location when she used this Charm, inflicting a −3 penalty on vision-based rolls.
 - Light sources within range are extinguished, as with [[Sun-Swallowing Voracity]]. Anima banners’ radiance is diminished, as if they were one step lower.
 - The darkness counts as a shadowland, although it doesn’t open into the Underworld.
 - It counts as being night for relevant effects. Using this to begin casting a ghost-summoning spell or similar magic shortens the ritual’s duration to one hour.
In the [[Underworld]], Malfeas, and other realms of existence, the Abyssal can snuff out the light of their alien suns or their nearest equivalent.
When the Abyssal uses this Charm to uphold a negative Defining [[Intimacy]] or a Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] based on death’s chivalry, she may extend its range to ([[Essence]]) miles once per story.
