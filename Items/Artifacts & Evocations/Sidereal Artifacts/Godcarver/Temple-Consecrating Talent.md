*Stately cathedrals and elephantine idols raised with [[Godcarver]] are more than sites of reverence; their [[Essence]] is interwoven with that of their consecrated deity.*
Godcarver’s wielder undertakes a mundane superior project to create temple, grand shrine, gigantic idol, or similar for a god whom she has a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward, imbuing it with the following benefits: 
- When the wielder uses [[Heaven-Pleasing Altar]], the god counts as having a Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] of gratitude or reduces the intensity of a negative [[Intimacy|Tie]] by two. Negative Minor Ties instead count as Minor Ties of gratitude. 
- The god can respond to prayers by appearing physically to the supplicant, committing fifteen motes and paying one [[Willpower]] to do so for a scene. 
- Members of the god’s cult and anyone bearing the god’s blessing double 9s on rolls against disease, poison, Derangements, possession, and similar ailments within a structure or while near an idol or other depiction created by [[Godcarver]]. 
- Godcarver’s wielder and the god can awaken [[Evocations]] from the structure, based on the god’s purview, history, and relationship with the wielder. 
## Dissonant
If the wielder ceases to have a qualifying [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward the god, this Charm’s blessing ends. Any purchased [[Evocations]] have their experience point cost refunded.
