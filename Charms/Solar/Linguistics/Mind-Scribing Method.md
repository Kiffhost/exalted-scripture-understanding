Even chained in a lightless dungeon, the Lawgiver can write a book that transforms the world. This Charm allows the Solar to engage an extended roll to produce a long work (p. 221) without requiring that she have any writing instruments. The Exalt stores her progress mentally, and may copy it down at her earliest convenience. There is no limit to how many novels, epics, and dogmas the Exalt may store in this fashion. As the Solar is copying her own work, she may use a combination of [[Whirling Brush Method]] and [[Perfect Recollection Discipline]] to copy a remembered work with tremendous speed. The Solar is explicitly permitted to enhance any writing she composes in her head with other [[Linguistics]] [[Charms]], even those with the written-only keyword.
