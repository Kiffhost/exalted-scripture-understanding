The broken Mask obscures Sidereals from memory. When someone leaves a Sidereal’s presence (or vice versa), he forgets her completely. He remembers the results of her actions, but attributes them to someone or something else. This doesn’t apply to knowledge of the Sidereal Exalted as a whole, only to individual Sidereals. 

Nontrivial characters can roll ([[Wits]] + [[Integrity]]) at difficulty 7 to resist a Sidereal’s arcane fate. Quick Characters without an applicable pool roll (base [[Resolve]] x2). Ties to the Sidereal add ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice on this roll, and a character’s history with an existing Sidereal, knowledge of Sidereals in general, and other circumstances may grant similar bonuses. Arcane fate is a mind-altering Shaping effect (p. XX). Magic that specifically protects against memory-altering Psyche effects can also be used against it. 

Additionally, a nontrivial character with a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to a Sidereal can roll as above if he later encounters her again to regain any memories of her that he’s lost to arcane fate. At the [[Storyteller]]’s discretion, something that reminds him of the Sidereal or that gives him reason to suspect his memories have altered may also let him roll. 

Some characters are immune arcane fate. Other Sidereals and gods in the [[Bureau of Destiny]] are immune, as are powerful enemies of fate (p. XX) — those who’re Exalted or have Essence 5+ — are likewise immune to arcane fate. Familiars, sorcerously-bound spirits, and beings she’s created, animated, or summoned with magic are also immune. A Sidereal player character’s Circlemates are immune to her arcane fate. 

Documents and other recorded information about Sidereals — either individually or a whole — are also subject to arcane fate. They’re lost, destroyed, or otherwise rendered inaccessible through subtle manipulations of fate. This doesn’t apply to records that maintained by characters immune to arcane fate, nor to those that contain only minimal detail or that describe Sidereals with vague, indirect, or symbolic language, like the [[Immaculate Texts]]. 

There aren’t specific rules for arcane fate’s applicability to records. The Storyteller can invoke it when dramatically appropriate. Such records might still be retrieved or reconstructed; rolls to do so have a minimum difficulty of 7.
