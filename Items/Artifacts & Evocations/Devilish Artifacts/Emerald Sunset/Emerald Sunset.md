### ACT I
*A great sound of thunder; green fire; LIGIER appears.*
**LIGIER**: You have summoned me, yet the chains of your will do not shackle my soul.
**THE PRINCE**: I do not seek to bind you, O mighty one.
**LIGIER**: Such is the arrogance of the masters of this earth! Then ere I return I shall take my revenge upon you, for the suffering inflicted, the prison of torment which you have made of my father. ’Tis paltry reward, but all the same.
**THE PRINCE**: O mighty one, hear me, then slay me, if you still will. I beckoned you here not to bind you, but in hope of swaying your heart. I, who have delved into all the mysteries of Hell, can conceive of nothing greater than this, Prince of Princes: Your love. No binding could give it to me. Embrace me, and stay a night; and then slay me, or love me, and I shall accept it either way.
**LIGIER**: Your pride is your doom; take my hand.
### ACT II
*The throne room.*
**THE PRINCE**: How many years has it been? Yet my love does not falter.
**LIGIER**: Neither does mine. Each time I look upon our son, it is renewed. So why then the shadow in your eyes?
**THE PRINCE**: It is my kin. We are all crowned in the sun; yet they think me serving a master of emerald. They do not understand we are equals.
**LIGIER**: We are not, for all our love.
**THE PRINCE**: O Mighty one! Beloved one! I beseech you: Make for me a work most beautiful, which unites in gold and brass our two worlds, which in my hand shall proclaim my authority over demonkind, that I am the greatest of sorcerers, who alone won Ligier’s love!
**LIGIER**: This, as all things, is in my power. I shall make for you a bow whose strings keen like a heart, whose arrows are each a demon’s life, which shall proclaim your authority over both of our realms. Yet the cost—
**THE PRINCE**: Anything.
**LIGIER**: Anything? I must ask—
**THE PRINCE**: Do not. Such is my love, I shall not ask. Anything of mine is yours. Take it. Go.
**LIGIER**: As you will.
### ACT III
*Night; the workshop.*
**THE PRINCE**: O Mighty one — Ligier! My love. ’Tis late, and dark. Still you work.
**LIGIER**: It is done.
**THE PRINCE**: Such clanging of the hammer! And yet I hear no cry. Where is our son?
*Ligier produces ***THE BOW***. ***THE PRINCE*** *takes it.*
**LIGIER**, kindly: You hold him now. Hold tight, and never let him go.

## [[Evocations]] of [[Emerald Sunset]]
Emerald Sunset is a slender bow, its orichalcum covered by a greenish patina from channeling demonic Essence. It is embossed with sigils of authority and inspires a faint sense of dread. Emerald Sunset’s wielder can flurry threaten actions with aim actions without any penalties.
