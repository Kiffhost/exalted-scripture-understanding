*The Abyssal is an invincible force of entropy, striking away even the mightiest attacks with contempt.*
The Abyssal gains the following defenses:
 - For four motes, she can parry an unblockable attack.
 - After a decisive damage roll against her, she can pay four motes and any amount of [[Initiative]], subtracting one success from the damage roll for each [[Initiative]] spent.
 - For four motes, one [[Willpower]], she may perfectly parry a source of uncountable damage, like a detonating [[First Age]] superweapon. If the damage is recurring, she becomes immune to it for the rest of the scene.
