*The Infernal warps one of her lessers into a form that better suits her needs, a cruel lesson in service and humility.*

The Infernal inflicts a hideous transformation on a mortal or First Circle demon who’s either willing or helpless, contorting him into a form suitable for a mount. His arms become legs, incapable of holding or manipulating anything. (If it has multiple arms, only two are affected.) The nature of the transformation may vary from Infernal to Infernal, but any differences are purely cosmetic. He grows in size as part of this transformation, but typically must be at least approximately the size of a human for the Infernal to ride him.

This transformation also imposes the following effects:
- The transformed character gains a +1 Speed bonus.
- He gains a Major Tie of obedience to the Infernal.
- He counts as an animal for purposes of Infernal Ride Charms.

With Essence 3, this Charm’s duration becomes Indefinite. Trivial characters can be transformed permanently.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Woeful Spasm-Warped Coursier]] reflexively with this Charm, spinning a Chrysalis Grotesque around him as he undergoes both Charm’s transformations.
## [[Keys]]
#### Supreme Demon Steed (Essence 2)
The Infernal can transform willing Second Circle demons. They don’t gain a Tie to her. With Essence 3, this extends to Third Circle demons. The demon must have a body that’s compatible with personal-scale movement; the great ravine Munaxes can’t be saddled.
#### Infernal Subjugation Yoke (Essence 3)
Transformed mounts count as the Infernal’s familiar and as First Circle demons for purposes of Infernal Ride Charms.
