*With a low droning voice, the Dragon-Blood lulls her listener into dreamless sleep.*
To use this Charm, she must first use its prerequisite to induce a receptive state in her target. She rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Presence]]) against his [[Resolve]], causing him to fall asleep unless he pays two [[Willpower]] to resist. He cannot be woken from this sleep by others without magic for the rest of the scene and an hour thereafter, and won’t awake of his own volition for at least a day. While asleep, the Dragon-Blood may make a single influence roll against him with the benefits of [[Minds Like Fertile Fields]], whispering the words in his ear as he sleeps. With an [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Dragon-Blood may pay an additional five motes to place a target whose permanent [[Willpower]] is lower than her [[Essence]] into perpetual slumber. He doesn’t suffer from hunger or thirst while he sleeps, nor does he age, but he cannot be woken without magical intervention. The Exalted are immune to this effect; other supernatural creatures aren’t. A third [[Essence]] 5 repurchase lets her pay a total of ten motes and two [[Willpower]] to petrify a target she could have placed into eternal slumber, transforming him into an inanimate statue. She may spend five motes and one [[Willpower]] to reverse the petrification with a touch. Otherwise, it can only be undone with magic such as [[Order-Affirming Blow]] (Exalted, p. 334). This Charm may only be used against a character once per story.
