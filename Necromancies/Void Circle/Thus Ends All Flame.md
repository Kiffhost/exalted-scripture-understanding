*Unfurling a shawl of black frost harvested from the nightmares of He Whom the Fire Forsook, the necromancer scours the land with nightmarish cold.*
The necromancer curses an area within (Essence + 3) range bands that she can perceive, as large as a milewide region or as small as a single structure. Hoary mists rise over the next minute as the spell takes hold, giving a brief warning to the wary. After that, the intense cold snap is an environmental hazard with difficulty 7 and Damage 3L/minute. Anyone slain by it becomes a ghost bound within their frozen corpse until it is destroyed, gaining a Defining Tie of desperate loyalty to whomever whoever freed them.
Within the spell’s area, all mundane flames are instantly snuffed, and new ones can’t be lit. Magical flames and heat reduce their damage by five, to a minimum of one, and halve the range of their illumination. At the Storyteller’s discretion, other effects possessed by supernatural fire may be similarly diminished. Water freezes, encrusting standing bodies with ice thick enough to walk across or filling moving rivers with jagged ice. Fire-based spirits and behemoths who die within the frosts are permanently destroyed.
Passion is likewise chilled. Intimacies based on primal emotions (p. XX) or on positive emotions such as joy, hope, or love are treated as one step lesser in intensity within the region. Affected characters with such Intimacies treat the area as difficult terrain, weighted down by their own hearts, though the necromancer and characters unencumbered by such passions pass through freely.
## Control
The necromancer is forever wreathed in frost as if radiating severe cold. Characters unequipped for this cold suffer a −1 penalty within short range or her or −2 within close. Spirits associated with flame and heat count as having a Minor Tie of fear towards her, and small flames snuff themselves out when she passes by.
## Distortion (16)
A rival necromancer may weave a counterspell, protecting him and anyone within close range from the passion-dampening effect and granting (his Essence/2, rounded up) automatic successes on rolls to resist the cold. Distortion may also be used to free a large room or equivalent area from the cold, like the eye of a storm.
