*Those aboard the Abyssal’s dread flagship can feel her eerie presence in every creaking timber and flickering shadow.*
The Abyssal claims the ship she’s aboard as her own, permanently bonding to it. She can’t claim a ship that belongs to another Exalt. Other characters aboard the ship count as having a Minor Tie of fear towards her. If the Abyssal formally welcomes someone aboard the ship, she may change this to a Tie of respect or choose not to impose a Tie — but she can rescind this and revert to a Tie of fear at any time.
Additionally, anyone aboard the ship with such a Tie increases its [[Resolve]] penalty by −1 and suffers a −1 penalty on rolls that go against that [[Intimacy]]. (This includes genuine Ties as well as the Intimacies imposed by this Charm.) If the [[Intimacy]] is Major or Defining, the penalty on rolls increases to −2. Those welcomed aboard ship by the Abyssal don’t suffer this penalty, but she can freely revoke this permission.
