*Deception comes easily to the deathknight’s skillful hand.*
The Abyssal perfectly forges a signature she’s familiar with or copies a text so precisely that it’s indistinguishable from the original. She can reproduce illustrations, maps, and other visual details included in a text. However, she can’t forge wax seals or the like — only writing.
Attempts to detect this forgery fail automatically unless enhanced by magic. The difficulty of rolls to see through is increased to a minimum of the Abyssal’s ([[Essence]] + [[Linguistics]]) at the time she uses this Charm.
With a [[Linguistics]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to perfectly replicate someone’s writing voice as long as she has access to at least three samples of his writing, or a single book-length work. The difficulty to see through the forgery is increased by one, and characters can’t roll to see through it unless they have a specific reason to scrutinize the text.
