Fire is the energy of Creation, the dynamic power that is ever restless, never satisfied. It engulfs all that it touches, consuming to burn brighter and hotter, spreading beyond control until there’s nothing left to burn. It knows no restraint, no half-measures, and even when reduced to nothing more than smoldering coals, it can still ignite a deadly wildfire. But it’s not wholly without subtlety, for there would be no shadow without the light of the flame, and no smoke without the ferocious heat of its blaze. 

Exalting as a [[Fire Aspect]] intensifies every feeling and emotion, kindling the flames of passion in even the stoniest hearts. Those who were serene or stoic before Exaltation learn to embrace the spontaneity of their emotions, while those who were already passionate grow more so, perhaps even hot-headed. When they love, they love with all their hearts. When they hate, they hate with the burning intensity of an inferno. No action is meaningless to a [[Fire Aspect]] — everything they do, they believe in whole-heartedly. 

The Children of Hesiesh exult in battle, cutting down foes with deft grace or brutal force and flickering across battlefields untouched in ceaseless movement. Their passions overflow in inspiring speeches and heartfelt actions, drawing every eye at the gala or spreading their views like wildfire in the chambers of the Deliberative. Yet they’re also talented intriguers, concealing their true hearts amid shadows and gleaning the hidden truths of other’s passions. As generals, they lead from the front, inspiring their soldiers with their intensity. As savants or sorcerers, they’re driven to put what they’ve learned into action, not satisfied with abstract contemplation.

A [[Fire Aspect]] who joins a Sworn Kinship is passionately loyal even as she might conflict with her Hearthmates, challenging their assumptions or playing devil’s advocate in argument. If she invites strife, it’s only because she knows she must renew the passions of her Sworn Kin and remind them of their purpose. In Dragon-Blooded societies, they’re driving forces of social change, attacking hallowed traditions that have ceased to be useful and challenging prevailing beliefs that have led their peers into error. Once the old ways have faced their scrutiny and burnt to ash, greater freedoms can prevail.

# Aspect Markings

Fire Aspects tend toward a constant flushed tone to their skin. Many radiate more body heat than most people, making them hot to the touch. They can smell faintly of smoke, fragrant incense, or ash. Some have eyes that glow like embers, or emit puffs of smoke when they speak or exhale. 

# Anima Banner

[[Fire Aspect]] animas leap and surge in red, orange, or yellow hues, shimmering and blazing like a bonfire or smoldering like the subtle heat of still-burning coals. Some give off the crackling roar of a forest fire, or the dull scream of a stoked blast furnace. Their iconic animas are spectacular displays: fire dragons, erupting volcanos, perpetual explosions, or animals like tigers or falcons made of flame.

# Anima Effects

Fire Aspects are unburnt by flame while immolating their foes with anima flux, and draw power from their passions (p. 155). 
- For five motes, the [[Fire Aspect]] becomes completely immune to mundane [[environmental hazards]] based on fire or heat for a scene. She adds ([[Essence]]) natural soak and gains [[Hardness]] 2 against fire-based attacks like [[Firewand|firewands]]. She gains these benefits for free while at bonfire.
- Once per day, when the [[Fire Aspect]] takes a nonextended action to uphold an emotion-based [[Intimacy]], she adds ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm bonus dice to the roll.
- A Fire Aspect’s anima flux deals (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) damage to characters without [[Hardness]] instead of one die.

# Great Curse Manifestation

A Fire Aspect’s Great Curse intensifies her emotions and desires to the point of dangerous excess. Depending on the circumstances, she might be overcome with overwhelming zeal for her cause, self-hatred over any imperfection she displays, reckless fury against hated foes or in defense of those she loves, or self-sacrificing despair when those she loves suffer.
