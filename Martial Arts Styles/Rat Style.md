# [[Rat Style]]
Rat style is known for its nimble acrobatics, stealth tactics, and ruthless methods. Stylists’ strikes and footwork are rapid and erratic, making their movements difficult for enemies to track. They dart towards foes, making a flurry of swift blows before dancing out of reach. Sometimes, one such exchange is all it takes — Rat stylists specialize in making use of disease to finish off their foes. Rat style’s most famed practitioners are assassins. Its masters can be found among the Grass Spiders, the Blessed Isle’s Gallows Dogs, and the Clan Best Forgotten. It’s also practiced for self-defense, particularly in the urban slums in which it’s said to have originated. Rat style generally holds a low reputation among practitioners of other styles, sometimes breeding feuds between schools.
## Weapons
Rat style uses rapid successions of punches, claw strikes, and eye gouges, as well as sweeping low kicks. It’s also compatible with [[Hand Needle|hand needles]], [[Knife|knives]], and [[tiger claws]]. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced by Rat style [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage.
## Armour
Rat style is incompatible with armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Dodge]] and [[Stealth]] are key to Rat style’s hit-and-run tactics.
