*White Lizard’s [[Tail]] moves like a vast and deadly serpent, striking at its wielder’s foes.*
The wielder adds ([[Essence]]) dice of post-soak damage to a withering attack, an automatic success on the damage roll of a damaging decisive attack, or ([[Essence]]) automatic successes on a gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll. Against branded enemies, she adds an additional (Charisma/2, rounded up) dice on the attack roll.
## Resonant
The dice added against branded enemies are non-Charm.
