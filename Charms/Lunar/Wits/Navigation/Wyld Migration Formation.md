The Lunar traces a silver thread of passage through the chaos of the Wyld and the weird landscapes of worlds stranger still. She and up to (Essence x2) companions ignore the effects of exposure to the Wyld and similar environmental shaping effects while traveling along a course plotted with Lodestone Reckoning Manner. Mounts don’t count toward the limit on companions. Courses plotted through the Wyld always include at least one path that follows Creation’s physical laws. If the Lunar reactivates this Charm at its duration’s end, she waives its Willpower cost. A Wits 5, Essence 3 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a three-mote surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one day. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is migratory can learn this as a Perception Charm.
