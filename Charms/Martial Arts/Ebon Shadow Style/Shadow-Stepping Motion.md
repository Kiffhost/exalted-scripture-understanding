*The Ebon Shadow crosses from hiding place to hiding place as though she could walk through shadows, vanishing and reappearing across the battlefield.*
[[Shadow-Stepping Motion]] can supplement any movement action taken while in stealth, applying double 9s to the roll and negating the increased penalty for crossing wide-open terrain. 
If the martial artist uses [[Shadow-Stepping Motion]] to close in on an enemy before making an unexpected attack against him, her sudden lunge doubles the penalties inflicted by a surprise decisive attack, or adds the martial artistâ€™s [[Stealth]] to the post-soak damage of surprise withering attack.
