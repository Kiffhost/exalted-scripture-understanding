*Death’s Lawgiver pours her malice into her works, tempting those who bear them to dark deeds.*
Upon completing a [[Crafting Projects|craft project]], the Abyssal imbues her with a malign influence, compelling the object’s owner to engage in some destructive or criminal behavior related to it. A sword might demand violence, while a chalice might encourage drinking to excess. The Abyssal makes a special ({[[Charisma]] or [[Manipulation]]} + [[Craft]]) [[persuade]] roll to determine the compulsion’s strength.
If the object’s owner has a [[Resolve]] lower than the Abyssal’s successes, he faces its temptation whenever he has the opportunity to engage in the chosen act. He enters a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]], requiring him to cite an [[Intimacy]] whose intensity depends on the level of project used for the creation: Minor for basic or [[Major Project|major projects]], Major for [[Superior Project|superior projects]], or Defining for [[Legendary Project|legendary projects]]. This influence only triggers while a character has the objection on his person (or is inside of a structure), and doesn’t affect the Abyssal.
Once a character has faced (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) [[Decision Points]], he’s immune to this Charm’s influence for the rest of the story. However, the only way to be permanently freed of it is to abandon the object — even magic capable of breaking [[Charm Keywords#Psyche|Psyche]] effects is ineffective. Doing requires entering a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and citing an [[Intimacy]] as above, but costs three [[Willpower]].
