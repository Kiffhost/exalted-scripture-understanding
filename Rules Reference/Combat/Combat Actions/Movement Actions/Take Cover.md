This action is used to seek [[Cover]] from attackers, such as by crouching behind a rock, tucking into a doorway, standing behind a tree, or moving behind a wall. Taking cover requires a ([[Dexterity]] + [[Dodge]]) rollâ€”the Storyteller sets the difficulty according to how easy it is to find and reach appropriate cover. [[Cover]] may be [[Cover#Light|light]], [[Cover#Heavy|heavy]], or [[Cover#Full|full]].
