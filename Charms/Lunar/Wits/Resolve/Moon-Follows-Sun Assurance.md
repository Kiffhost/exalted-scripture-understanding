The sacred vows that once bound the Lunar and Solar Exalted are reborn. The Lunar’s positive Ties to her Solar mate can’t be weakened or altered by social influence, except her Solar mate’s influence. She can still erode them voluntarily. Once per story, when the Lunar forms or strengthens a positive Tie to her Solar mate, she gains one Willpower. This can raise her temporary Willpower above her permanent Willpower rating. If her Solar mate forms or strengthens a positive Tie toward her while in her presence, he also gains this bonus once per story.
