*Drawing in tremendous spirit energy, the Solar launches an explosive attack that carries her skyward with the force of the rising sun.*
This Charm can only be triggered at 20+ [[Initiative]]. It unleashes a massive decisive attack to everything within short range of the Lawgiver. The Exalt’s form is suffused with burning Solar [[Essence]] that fires straight up in a column that can be seen for miles. This is a non-standard decisive attack; roll the Solar’s [[Dexterity]] + [[Brawl]] once and apply the result to the entire group. This attack can hit allies. Targets struck by this attack are carried upward on a column of destructive force, one range band for every ten [[Initiative]] the Solar possesses. For every range band the targets are lifted, they are subject to three dice of hardness-ignoring decisive bashing damage and must then contend with falling damage. This portion of the attack does not reset the Solar’s [[Initiative]]. The Solar is also carried up to the same height as her enemies, but at the apex she pauses, [[Essence]] and anima swirling around her like a second sun. Then she plummets at an angle in any chosen direction, falling half the range bands she rose (rounded up). There she comes down like a falling star, hammering a crater into the earth and striking all opponents at close range with her explosive fury. This is a normal decisive attack that, if successful, does half her [[Initiative]] (rounded up) in hardness-ignoring decisive damage dice to all opponents at close range. This calamitous falling strike does no harm to the Solar.
