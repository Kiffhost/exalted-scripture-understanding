The Lunarâ€™s inscrutability lends mysterious appeal to her arguments. To use this Charm, she must have successfully asserted [[Guile]] previously that scene. She rerolls (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) failed dice on an influence roll with any Attribute against a single character who failed opposing her [[Guile]]. She may use this Charm once per successful application of [[Guile]].
