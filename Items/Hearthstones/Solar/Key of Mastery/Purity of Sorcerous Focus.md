The sorcerer gains new insight into a spell of the Terrestrial Circle, imprinting its [[Essence]] upon the stone. The chosen spell provides all the benefits of a control spell for as long as the stone remains attuned. The sorcerer can switch to a different spell once per story. At [[Essence]] 3, the sorcerer can instead imprint a spell of the Celestial Circle. At [[Essence]] 5, she can choose a spell of the Solar Circle.
