*The deathknight imbues her patient with unliving resilience, lest he succumb to the rigors of her treatment.*
The Abyssal grants a character a number of temporary −0 health levels equal to her [[Essence]]. These temporary levels are the first to be filled when he’s damaged, and vanish when damaged.
When used on animated corpses, this Charm costs only five motes, or one mote for trivial characters.
Death’s [[Essence]] takes a toll on mortals: once this Charm ends or their last temporary health level is damaged, they suffer a level of damage.
