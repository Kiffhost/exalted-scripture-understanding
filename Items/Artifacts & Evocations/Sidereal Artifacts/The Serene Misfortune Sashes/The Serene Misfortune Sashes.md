Upon her loom of sacred cypress, Ouzha Nine-Handed wove nine sashes from nine bolts of rainbow fabric. Nine measures of starmetal she used for her weft, beaten thinner than a maiden’s hair. Nine are the colors of the sashes themselves: crimson and ultramarine, jonquil and viridian, cyan and gamboge, indigo and rose, and a singular black snipped from cloth-of-night. She wove for nine years, and smiled at her works, for Ouzha feared nothing in the world but death, and fear was the tenth fabric upon her loom. Each of the Serene Misfortune Sashes is a delicate froth of woven rainbow and irregular brocade, unique in its pattern from its sister-sashes. They may be tied around the waist or fastened with a needle-fine starmetal pin, their hues shifting subtly to suit the wearer’s outfit and complexion. Of the eight sashes whose locations are known to Heaven, some are kept by the Cerulean Lute’s quartermasters for Sidereals of suitable temperament. Others belong to the treasure-wardrobes of powerful celestial gods, having been given as gifts by Ouzha (and subsequently changing hands several times). Some of these gods have been known lend their sashes — freely or otherwise — to allies and proteges, whether to curry favor or enrich their sash’s burgeoning mythos. Of the ninth, nothing is known. Woven with Ouzha’s fear of death, the sashes are silken armor that subtly bend fate to transform their wearer’s tragedies into calamitous bad luck. One might escape certain doom by the grace of their sash, only to find their lives crumbling around them. They are infrequent plot devices in heavenly plays. In tragedies, their wearers batter their fists against the ground in despair; in comedies, they look upon their misfortune and smile. They say: Calamities may pass with time, but death gives no reprieve.
## [[Evocations]] of the Serene Misfortune Sash
[[The Serene Misfortune Sashes]] don’t count as armor for determining their compatibility with [[Martial Arts]]. Each of the nine sashes has its own unique set of [[Evocations]], each taking its own approach to substituting misfortune for injury, failure, and other setbacks. The following [[Evocations]] focus on protecting the wearer from physical injury, but some sashes might instead protect its wearer’s reputation, wealth, relationships, or the like.
