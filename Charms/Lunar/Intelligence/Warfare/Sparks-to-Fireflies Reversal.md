*A legendary strategist, the Lunar is never caught off guard or left without recourse.*
She makes a Strategic Maneuver roll in battle, revealing preparations she’s previously taken. A single enemy may pay one [[Willpower]] to oppose this with his ([[Intelligence]] + [[War]]) roll; if the battle is occurring under a stratagem he enacted, the [[Willpower]] cost is waived. If the Lunar meets her stratagem’s threshold, she enacts it and negates any enemy stratagems in place. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by suffering a significant setback in combat — e.g., the rout of an allied battle group or the destruction of a major defensive measure — that threatens a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]]. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is a creature that hunts in groups may learn this as a [[Stamina]] Charm.
