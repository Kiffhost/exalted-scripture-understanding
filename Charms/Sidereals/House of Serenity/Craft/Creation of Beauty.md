*The Sidereal plies her raw materials with honeyed words and winsome grace, bringing forth their hidden beauty.*
The Sidereal adds up to ({[[Appearance]] or [[Charisma]]}/2, rounded up) non-Charm dice on a Craft roll, paying two motes per die. If she does, she ignores penalties from lacking suitable tools; flattery and grace are all she needs.
A Sidereal with [[Elemental Vision]] can instead add up to ([[Appearance]] or [[Charisma]]) non-Charm dice instead if she’s working with raw materials of that element. Likewise, if she has [[World-Shaping Artistic Vision]], she gains the same benefit on rolls to which it applies.
