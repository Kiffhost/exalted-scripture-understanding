Once, there was a maiden…
...who set sail with a Captain she did not know. The
sea came over the side as a creature with teeth.
So, she set it on fire, until only the teeth were left.
It wasn’t expecting that to happen.
She noticed the ship was crushing the waves, and
told the Captain to steer the ship higher, so that it
could be above them. “But not too high,” she said.
“I’d hate to crush the clouds.”
A face in the depths glared at the Captain. The
maiden got angry. She broke the face, and broke
the depths, and broke the sea, leaving only the
white caps of the waves. “Why did you do that?”
asked the face.
“Rarely is travel peaceful,” the maiden said.
