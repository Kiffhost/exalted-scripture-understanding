*Rainwalker hums with defensive [[Essence]], rotating to deflect falling raindrops and incoming attacks alike.*
This Evocation waives a [[full defense]]’s [[Initiative]] cost. It also adds an additional +1 [[Defense|Parry]] that counts as a bonus from [[Charms]]. 

## Resonant

As long as the wielder enjoys the [[full defense]] bonus, her successful parries cause her attacker to lose 1 [[Initiative]] (which she doesn’t gain).
