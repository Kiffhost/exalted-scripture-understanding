*As one heartbeat begins, the stylist draws her sword from its scabbard. By the heartbeat’s end, the blade is already stained with the blood of her enemy.*
The swordsman may attack an enemy out to medium range, drawing her blade and flashing to the enemy’s side in a single lunge that counts as her movement action for the round. She adds one automatic success to both the attack and damage roll for each range band she crosses, channeling the devastating momentum of her advance into the strike. However, if the attack misses, the swordsman loses control of her momentum, sliding past her target to end her movement at short range beyond him. 
When the stylist and her sword take their turns together on the same tick, they may unleash the devastating attack known as the Countless Strikes Sheathed, combining the two turns into the single action of activating this Charm. The swordsman makes the attack roll before beginning her movement, and chooses whether she will use her own Initiative or the sword’s to make the final decisive attack. If the swordsman’s movement toward her target brings her within close range of other enemies whose Defenses would be hit by her attack roll, she may choose to reflexively strike them. Against each such enemy, she may choose to make a withering strike, which deals her Essence in Initiative damage and adds to the Initiative pool chosen for the final attack (including any Initiative Breaks received), or a decisive strike, which lets her forgo up to (her Dexterity) points of Initiative from the chosen pool and roll it as damage which ignores hardness. If one of these preliminary decisive strikes incapacitates a nontrivial opponent, the Initiative invested in it is recovered.
Once the swordsman has cleared all enemies between her and the final target, she concludes with a decisive attack against the final target. Those struck by the Countless Strikes Sheathed do not even realize they have been attacked until the swordsman sheathes her blade at the conclusion of the final strike, at which point their wounds burst open.
