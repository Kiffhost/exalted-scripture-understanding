*All windblades allow the wielder to fly while standing atop them for five motes per hour of flight.*
They can travel at a speed of thirty-five miles per hour, but can't ascend more than medium range above the ground. Aerial movement on a [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Misc/Windblade]] uses the same dice pools as ordinary movement, but the [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Misc/Windblade]] adds its Speed Bonus to the roll as non-Charm dice. The Speed Bonus is halved, rounded down, if the [[Items/Artifacts & Evocations/The Grand Panoply/Misc/Windblade]] is weighed down by anything more than the wielder and her personal possessions, such as a second person being carried by her or unusually heavy cargo.

A windblade's wielder can take a miscellaneous action to collapse it, rendering it nonfunctional but reducing it to the size of a heavy belt buckle. She can return it to full size with another miscellaneous action. A windblade's [[Evocations]] can't be used while collapsed unless they specify otherwise.
