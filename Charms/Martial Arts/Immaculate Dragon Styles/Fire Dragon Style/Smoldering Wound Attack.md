This Charm may only be used after landing a decisive attack, but before rolling damage. For every 10 on the damage roll, the Immaculate rolls one die of unsoakable withering damage, which adds to her base Initiative upon resetting. She canâ€™t gain more than (Essence) Initiative this way. Against a crashed enemy, she rolls decisive damage instead, but still gains Initiative equal to the damage dealt. 
In Fire Aura, this Charm may be used after damage has been rolled.
