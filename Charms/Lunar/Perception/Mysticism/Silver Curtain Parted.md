*Walking between worlds, the Lunar deftly touches the other side and pries open its gateways.*
She rolls ({Perception or Wits} + {Larceny or Occult}) to enter a spirit’s sanctum, pass through a normally inaccessible magical portal, cross a boundary between realms of existence, or temporarily breach a magical barrier like a fiery wall created by a sorcerous working. The roll’s difficulty equals the [[Essence]] of the character who created or owns the boundary; if no such character exists, the Storyteller assigns a difficulty from 1-5. Success lets the Lunar and ([[Essence]] x2) companions pass through safely. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is migratory may learn this as a [[Wits]] Charm, with [[Wyld Migration Formation]] (p. XX) as its prerequisite.
