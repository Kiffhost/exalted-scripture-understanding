*The Abyssal radiates such overwhelming menace that her witnesses remember her only as a shapeless, looming terror.*
The Abyssal embodies terror, adding ([[Essence]]) dice on [[threaten]] rolls. Those who see her can’t recognize any details of her appearance, or even what kind of being she is, only that she’s something to be feared.
Characters with [[Intimacy|Ties]] to the Abyssal or who have superhuman or magically enhanced senses reflexively roll ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) roll, which she opposes with ([[Manipulation]] + [[Stealth]]). If they succeed, they can recognize she’s an Abyssal, but can’t make out anything more specific.
A [[Day]] Caste Abyssal who’s at bonfire anima can use this Charm reflexively and waives its cost. While she remains at bonfire, the added dice are non-Charm.
