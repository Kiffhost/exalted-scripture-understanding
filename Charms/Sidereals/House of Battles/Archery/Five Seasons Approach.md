If the Sidereal’s skill will not suffice, she may trust in the world’s esteem for her, its fear of what she would save it from, its dreams of what she might accomplish, or — if all else fails — in luck. The Sidereal makes a decisive attack against an enemy within extreme range, out to four range bands. She doesn’t need to aim to attack enemies at medium range or further. The attack’s power is born not of strategic advantage but of blind luck; the attack roll ignores penalties and it has base damage (Essence + attack roll extra successes), ignoring Hardness. It doesn’t include her Initiative or reset her to base. If the attack roll’s target number is reduced, each point of reduction extends this attack’s range by one band, letting the Sidereal attack at extreme range. Reset: Once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack that resets the Sidereal’s Initiative and then reaching Initiative 12+.
