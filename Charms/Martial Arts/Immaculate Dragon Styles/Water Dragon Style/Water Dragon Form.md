The Immaculate drops into a fighting stance in which offense and defense are a single fluid motion. She adds bonus dice on attack rolls equal to her targetâ€™s wound penalty, wearing down foes in an endless tide. Her Stamina is doubled when calculating her natural soak. 

## Special activation rules

When the Immaculate deals enough decisive damage to a nontrivial enemy to raise his wound penalty, she may reflexively enter this Form.
