As the Exalt raises her world from ash and ruin, she is renewed by her own labor and sacrifice. This Charm depicts a Solar who draws greater understanding from the restoration of objects than mortal crafters. After completing a repair, the Exalt gains one additional craft point for every basic objective completed. If she is repairing an Artifact, she earns (Artifact’s rating) gold points and one white point. Legendary Artifacts offer no repair rewards.
