The Lunar blesses a familiar with intellect and cunning far exceeding any beast’s. She may pay a four-experience-point surcharge when using [[Nature-Reinforcing Allocation]] on a familiar she’s enhanced with [[Blessed Moon-Beast Empowerment]] to grant it human-level intelligence instead of that Charm’s normal benefits. It gains human-level faculty for complex and abstract thought and the ability to understand all languages the Lunar knows (but not to speak them, unless its anatomy allows). It gains five-die pools for Diagnosing Ailments, [[Investigation]], [[Read Intentions]], and Strategy, and gains +1 [[Willpower]], [[Resolve]], and [[Guile]]. Familiars that already have human-level intelligence instead add one die to all pools for [[Intelligence]]-based actions or actions beyond a normal animal’s mental capability, maximum 14, and gain the [[Willpower]], [[Resolve]], and [[Guile]] bonuses above. This Charm’s experience point cost is waived the first time the Lunar uses it. If a familiar dies, the Lunar regains experience spent enhancing it.
