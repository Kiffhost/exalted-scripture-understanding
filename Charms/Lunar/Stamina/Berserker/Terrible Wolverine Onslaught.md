A surge of primal fury snaps the fetters restraining the Lunar’s full might, unleashing a savage force greater than even her own body can withstand. To use this Charm, Relentless Lunar Fury must be active. The Lunar gains the following benefits: 
-  She adds a success on all rolls using physical Attributes. 
-  She ignores wound penalties. 
-  She adds her wound penalty to decisive damage rolls. 
-  She can reflexively clash any attack against her with a withering or decisive attack. This counts as her attack action for the round. 
-  Decisive attacks she lands against battle groups provoke rout checks, even if they don’t reduce Size. If a withering or decisive attack reduces a battle group’s Size, the check is made at +1 difficulty. After using this Charm, it can’t be used until the Lunar heals all levels of aggravated damage. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with Berserker, the Lunar adds an additional success on attack rolls.
