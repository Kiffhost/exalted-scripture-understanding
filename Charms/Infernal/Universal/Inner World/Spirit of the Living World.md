*The Infernal has carved a world from the substance of her own soul, an otherworldly realm made in her image.*

The Infernal creates an inner world within her soul, a strange, uncanny place: a city of cyclopean basalt towers beneath a perpetually jet-black sky, lit only by a staring red eye. A ziggurat-tree of living ivory, swaying to the beat of the Infernal’s soul. A land of green and gold beyond the horizon, where the sun falls beneath the sea. The Infernal’s player should work with the Storyteller to create a concept for the inner world. The Storyteller builds on this concept in fleshing out any broader details about the world, but is encouraged to consult the Infernal’s player or delegate to him. If the Infernal has created her own demonic souls, they may have a separate existence within her inner world, often in geographical forms. This includes her fetich and other Third Circle souls even before she manifests them externally.

The Infernal may mentally enter her inner world while meditating, appearing at its centre or a point of similar significance. She can’t bring anything from the outside world into her inner world physically, nor can she take anything out of it. (For now.) She gains (higher of Essence or 3) additional motes per hour while within her inner world.

The Infernal can use introduce fact rolls to add new details to her inner world or revise existing ones. She can use any Attribute and Ability that fit for the roll and doesn’t need a Lore background, but introduced facts should build on the inner world’s concept or express the Infernal’s identity (and potentially soul hierarchy) through the world. The difficulty depends on how great a benefit it provides to the Infernal and how much of the inner world it defines:
- **Difficulty 1-3**: Facts that provide a small, immediate benefits or plot advancements: the existence of edible dream-crystals; a situationally advantageous custom of the world's denizens; the presence of an ancient ruin in a plausible location.
- **Difficulty 4-6**: Facts that provide long-term benefits or plot advancements, typically on the scale of a city-like region, but require further effort to realize: veins of precious metal; a species of strange beasts and how to tame them; a mysterious ruin's history.
- **Difficulty 7-9**: Facts that involve broad swathes of the world, typically providing new opportunities rather than direct benefits: a season of raining magma; a culture of denizens inhabiting a distant region; a vitreous ocean dotted by mosaic archipelagos.
- **Difficulty 10**: Facts that involve the inner world as a whole and its underlying metaphysics.
