### Prerequisite
Any natural poison This Merit may be repurchased multiple times.
The mutant applies one of the following to her natural poisons, and any poisons created by [[Charms]]:

### Blinding (••)
Characters damaged by the poison while crashed are blinded (Exalted, p. 168) for one day.

### Hallucinogenic (•)
Crashed victims don’t take lethal damage, instead losing [[Willpower]] equal to the damage roll. A character reduced to zero [[Willpower]] this way or damaged by the poison while at zero [[Willpower]] gains the Madness [[Derangement]] (Exalted, p. 168) at Minor intensity, or strengthens existing Madness by one step.

### Paralytic (••)
Crashed victims can’t take movement actions while suffering the poison’s effect.

### Potent (••)
The poison’s base duration is increased by two intervals and can’t be reduced below one interval by opposing rolls unless enhanced with magic.

### Necrotic (•)
Poisoned characters must also roll against a flesh-rotting disease with virulence 3, morbidity 3, and a one-week interval.
