The martial artist’s venomous touch paralyzes her victim’s Essence, numbing his inner power that she might feast on it. The stylist can pay a five-mote surcharge when she uses Maw of Dripping Venom to enhance its venom with the following effects: 
-  Any motes the victim loses to the poison are granted to the stylist. She can’t gain more than (Essence) motes per round total, no matter how many victims she has. 
-  No matter how many successes the poison’s victim rolls, its duration can’t be reduced below one round. 
-  While the victim’s poisoned, the stylist’s attacks against him steal motes equal to the damage roll’s 10s. If she crashes him or deals enough decisive damage to increase his wound penalty, she steals motes for 9s as well. 
-  The stylist can use the victim’s anima banner to pay the anima costs of her own Charms. Enlightenment: When an enemy takes aggravated damage from the poison, the stylist’s player chooses one of that character’s ongoing Charms or other effects to end, awarding the stylist any motes that were committed to that effect as above. Permanent effects can’t be negated.
