*The Lunar’s soul shines through her voice, suffusing arguments and entreaties with celestial majesty.*
When she makes an influence roll that upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]], she adds ([[Intimacy]]) non-Charm dice on the roll. 10s on her influence roll increase the cost to resist her influence by one [[Willpower]] each, maximum (Essence/2, rounded up). This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding the invoked [[Intimacy]] through a social action or a chain of events set in motion by one. It doesn’t require resetting if the Lunar rolls no successes.
