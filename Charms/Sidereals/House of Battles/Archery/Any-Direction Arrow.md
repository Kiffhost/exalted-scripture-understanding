Graced by the chance to serve destiny, the Sidereal’s arrow gleefully weaves through the air to strike from an unexpected direction. The Sidereal’s attack ignores [[Defense]] bonuses from cover and full defenses. She can attack enemies behind full cover, although they receive +3 non-Charm [[Defense]]. With [[Archery]] 4, [[Essence]] 2, the Sidereal can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to make her attack unblockable against lower-[[Initiative]] enemies.
