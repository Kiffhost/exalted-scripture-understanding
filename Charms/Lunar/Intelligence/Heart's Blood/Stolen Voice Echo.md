*The Lunar speaks in borrowed tongues.*
When she uses [[Memory-Drinking Meditation]], she also gains knowledge of up to ([[Linguistics]] + 1) languages her victim knows for two motes per language. She retains fluency only while in that character’s form, and uses his accent and dialect. With [[Intelligence]] 4, [[Essence]] 3, the Lunar gains permanent fluency in a language once she’s spent a season using it. She can use it in all forms, no longer needing [[Memory-Drinking Meditation]] to retain it.
