*Sit. Stay. Maim.*

The Infernal rolls (Charisma + Survival) to order a familiar to make an attack, rush, threaten roll, or feat of demolition, adding her successes as bonus dice on its roll. If she commands a familiar with Legendary Size to make an attack, it knocks its target back one range band if it deals damage.

The Infernal can also use this Charm to issue commands to Legendary Size behemoths or other beast-like creature that are willing to obey her. She can’t add more than (Essence) dice to their roll.
## Special activation rules
This Charm can be flurried. With Essence 3, it becomes Reflexive.
## [[Keys]]
#### Ambush Beast Atrocity
The Infernal can use this Charm to order a familiar to make a Stealth roll. With Survival 5, Essence 3, she can use her own Stealth Charms to enhance this roll.
#### Infernal Predator Instinct
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively to enhance a familiar’s Join Battle roll. She converts up to (Essence + Survival) added dice to automatic successes.
#### Unfettered Monstrosity Rampage (Survival 5, Essence 3, [[#Infernal Predator Instinct]]) (+3m)
Once per scene, the Infernal can pay a three-mote surcharge when she uses this Charm. On a decisive attack, her familiar adds attack roll extra successes as dice of damage, up to a maximum equal to the dice bonus it received from this Charm. On withering attacks, it doubles that many extra successes before calculating raw damage. The Infernal can reset this key by rolling 7+ successes on a subsequent use of this Charm to direct that same familiar to attack.
#### Twin Devils Calamity ([[#Unfettered Monstrosity Rampage (Survival 5, Essence 3, Infernal Predator Instinct ) (+3m)|Unfettered Monstrosity Rampage]])
After the roll, the Infernal can pay up to one Initiative per success, maximum (Essence + Charisma), to grant twice that much Initiative to the familiar.
