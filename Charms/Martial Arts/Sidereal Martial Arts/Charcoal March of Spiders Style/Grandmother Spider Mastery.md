*A web of endless invisible filaments surrounds the martial artist as she enters a stance of eightfold victory, seeming to split into many selves as she moves with a speed that transcends space and time.*
The stylist can pay a fifteen-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses this style’s Form to gain the following benefits: 
- Her extra [[Initiative]] tracks can be crashed normally, rather than being lost completely upon crash. 
- She can flurry this style’s Simple [[Charms]] with each other and other actions. This includes flurrying [[Charms]] that let her make attacks, but she must use a different [[Initiative]] track for each Charm’s attacks. 
- When she makes an attack, she may treat herself as being at any point within short range of her actual location for all purposes, including ranged attacks’ [[Accuracy]] bonuses, the applicability of cover, whether she is within range for a clash or counterattack, etc. This doesn’t let her attack at extreme range. 
- When an enemy makes an attack against her, she may treat herself as being at any point within short range of her actual location for all purposes, including ranged attacks’ [[Accuracy]] bonuses, the applicability of cover, whether she is within range for a clash or counterattack, etc. However, she can’t negate an attack outright by “moving” her location to a point beyond its range — in such cases, the attack is still rolled normally.
