The love song of Laughing Sky and Oak Ring Prince is one of Creation’s greatest romances, still sung by skalds and storytellers millennia after their death. The seventh lay of their cycle tells how the bold Oak Ring Prince sustained a grievous scar after defending his husband from a behemoth’s envenomed talons. Laughing Sky swore not to rest until he’d forged armor to keep his beloved safe and redouble the beauty he had lost. From that day forward, Oak Ring Prince wore [[Heartsbalm]] into every battle, making him as invincible as his love for Laughing Sky. Their romance tells of the incredible perils that he withstood for love’s sake, from single-handedly holding off the legions of the Chatoyant Sovereignty to braving the Thousand Razors Labyrinth to free his husband from Hell. After the Oak Ring Prince’s final battle against the Usurpation forces at the Calibration Feast, Laughing Sky took up his armor in a revenge-driven rampage against his killers. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of [[Heartsbalm]]

To attune to [[Heartsbalm]] for the first time, its bearer must draw upon the love embodied in a positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards another character. From that point on, that character is considered the wearer’s beloved. Romantic, familial, and other forms of love are all valid, as long as it’s a reciprocated, emotionally significant relationship. If the wearer’s beloved is killed, or their reciprocal love otherwise ends, the wearer may designate a new character as her beloved at the start of the next story. Until then, she loses the benefit of Heartsbalm’s [[Evocations]]. She can choose a new beloved before then by spending two experience points, which are refunded at the beginning of the next story. When Heartsbalm’s wearer uses a defend other action to protect her beloved, or her beloved protects her thusly, the protecting character gains +1 [[Defense]].
