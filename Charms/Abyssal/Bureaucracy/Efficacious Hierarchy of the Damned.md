*Death’s Lawgiver brings order to the Underworld with unmatched efficiency, bypassing millennia-old backlogs or obstruction from timeless ghost-ministers.*
The Abyssal significantly accelerates the rate at which an organization can complete a task: tasks that would take a century or less are completed in a season, those that would take a season are completed in a month, those that would take a month are completed in a week, those that would take a week are completed in a day, those that would take a day are completed in minutes, and those that would take less than a day are completed practically instantly. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this may represent the project having been initiated in advance, rather than ludicrous speed.
This doesn’t speed physical labor carried out by the organization’s members, but rather affects planning, authorization, allocation of resources, and similar bureaucratic tasks. The Abyssal must interact with the organization to use this Charm, but need not lead it — soliciting the task or aiding the organization with it is sufficient.
With [[Essence]] 2, the time needed to complete a task is instead reduced by ([[Essence]]) degrees — for example, if obtaining a loan from a ghostly trade consortium would normally take a month, an [[Essence]] 2 Abyssal could obtain it in a day, an [[Essence]] 3 Abyssal could obtain it within minutes, and an [[Essence]] 4 Abyssal could obtain it almost instantly.
