*The Abyssal’s terrible beauty eclipses all others, poisoning those who yearn for her.*
The Abyssal makes an instill roll against a single target to create or strengthen a Tie of romantic or sexual desire towards herself. If successful, her target suffers the following effects for this Charm’s duration:
 - The instilled [[Intimacy]] counts as one level higher against the Abyssal’s influence rolls if it’s advantageous for her. If the Tie is already Defining, her influence costs an additional [[Willpower]] for him to resist.
 - Against influence that leverages the instilled [[Intimacy]], he must weaken another of his positive Ties to resist with [[Willpower]], if he has any. Ties based on romantic or sexual desire must be weakened first.
 - If he voluntarily weakens a positive Tie, it can’t be strengthened by any means unless he pays two [[Willpower]] per level of intensity.
 - Once per day, when he voluntarily weakens another positive Tie in the Abyssal’s presence, she gains one [[Willpower]].
With an [[Essence]] 5 repurchase, the Abyssal may target multiple characters with this roll, paying a three-mote surcharge for each additional target.
