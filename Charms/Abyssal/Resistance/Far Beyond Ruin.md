*Embodying the inexhaustible abyss, the deathknight withers away her enemy’s strength.*
This Charm can be used after a decisive damage roll, forcing the attacker to reroll all dice that show successes. This occurs after any other rerolls. The total successes on the rerolled damage can’t exceed those on the original roll.
## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by being hit by three attacks that deal no damage to the Abyssal.
