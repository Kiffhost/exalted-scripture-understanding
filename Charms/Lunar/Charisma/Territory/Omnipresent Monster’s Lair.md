The Lunar lurks everywhere and nowhere within her territory, a primal fear whispering into her prey’s souls. While in a territory claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation, she may pay a six-mote surcharge when using Endless Nightmare Hunt to apply its effects to all characters within that territory with fear-based Ties toward her (including characters that enter the territory after she’s used it). While they remain within the territory, the Lunar counts as observing them for that Charm’s purposes, and she makes a single instill roll daily that’s applied against all victims sleeping in her territory. Leaving the territory frees a character from this effect, and such uses of Endless Nightmare Hunt end if the Lunar leaves her territory.
