Choose one of your Caste Abilities as your Primordial Ability.

You can learn Charms of your Primordial Ability as though you had [[Essence]] 5, and qualify for repurchases and automatic upgrades as if you had [[Essence]] 5 as well. [[Azimuth]] Castes may choose [[Martial Arts]] as their Primordial Ability. 

A Primordial Ability’s benefits don’t apply to spells or Sidereal Martial Arts.
