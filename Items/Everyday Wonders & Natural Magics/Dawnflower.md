This golden blossom — also called firstflower or eastern gift — is said by Ixcoatli merchants to come from a single mile-high tree that’s the first thing touched each morning by the rising sun’s rays. It is difficult to procure even in the far East, and rarer still in more distant lands. Fresh dawnflower withers before it can be brought back to civilization, but even dried, it holds mystical potency. 

Crushed to powder and used to draw a line on the ground, dawnflower bars the passage of demons, undead, and other creatures of darkness in the same way that lines of salt stop ghosts (Exalted, p. 506). Burned as incense, it strengthens thaumaturgical rites of exorcism (Exalted, p. 491), adding one bonus success on all rolls. Made into an oily paste to coat a weapon, it is a poison with Damage 2i/round (L in Crash), Duration 3 rounds, and a −3 penalty that only harms creatures of darkness.
