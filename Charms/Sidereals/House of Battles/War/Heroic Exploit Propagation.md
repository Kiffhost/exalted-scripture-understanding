The Sidereal may be forgotten, but not her deeds; the world itself sings of her victory. Once a battle ends, the Sidereal spreads its tale through the weave of fate. For the next day, anyone who sleeps within (Essence x50) miles of the battlefield dreams of that battle, a vivid and detailed reenactment that’s easily remembered upon waking. The Sidereal’s arcane fate applies to her appearances in these dreams. Enemies of fate appear as vague, indistinct figures in these dreams, as with Divination Charms (p. XX). If the Sidereal fought to uphold a Defining Intimacy, those who dream of the battle gain that Intimacy at Minor intensity unless they spend one Willpower. Reset: Once per story unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through warfare. Shieldbearers can reset it by fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
