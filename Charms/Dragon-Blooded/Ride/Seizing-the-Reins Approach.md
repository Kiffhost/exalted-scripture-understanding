The Dragon-Blood rides away with her enemiesâ€™ steeds, showing even the most ferocious mounts that they cannot equal her burning, reckless spirit. She attempts to leap onto the mount of an unhorsed foe (or another trained animal without a rider) within close range. This is a difficulty 3 gambit rolled with (Dexterity + Ride). Successfully executing this gambit lets the Dragon-Blood climb onto the animal and reflexively order it to make a withering attack (Exalted, p. 203). In Fire Aura, the Dragon-Blood may use this Charm reflexively when she successfully unhorses an enemy (Exalted, p. 200) within close range using any combat Ability.
