The sorcerer can brew a draught that catalyzes an upswell of power from within. Creating a single dose of this potion is a difficulty 2 ([[Intelligence]] + [[Craft]]) roll that takes a few hours, with an increased difficulty if the sorcerer lacks access to a wide range of alchemical components and/or a properly stocked workshop for brewing. Brewing a larger batch increases the difficulty by 2, but provides the sorcerer with effectively as much of the potion as she needs. Drinking this potion is a miscellaneous action, rolling ([[Stamina]] + [[Occult]]) and gaining a sorcerous mote for each success. These motes last for the duration of the scene, and can be spent towards any spell she casts. She may only benefit from one draught each scene, and the balance of reagents to humors means the potion only benefits the sorcerer who brewed it. A prepared draught retains its efficacy for about a week, meaning that even a large batch will soon become dilute and powerless. The sorcerer may prepare special elixirs that permanently retain their efficacy, but provide sorcerous motes that can only be spent casting her control spell.
