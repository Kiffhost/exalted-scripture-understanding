*The Infernal’s patter is intoxicating, tempting others into forbidden exchanges.*

The Infernal doubles 8s and ignores penalties for implausible claims on a bargain or persuade roll to convince a single character to buy or sell a good or service or to obtain something for himself through criminal means. She doubles 7s instead for commerce that’s illegal or disreputable, like dealing in contraband, bartering on a holy day, or hiring an assassin, or for convincing people to commit crimes that carry a significant punishment.

If the Infernal rolls 3+ extra successes, her target gains a Minor Obsession toward whatever he seeks to obtain (Exalted, p. 169). She doesn’t need extra successes on rolls that double 7s or against mortals and First Circle demons. Once the target obtains the object of his obsession or (10 – his Resolve) days have passed, he can pay one Willpower to convert it to an equivalent Principle of possessiveness or obsession.
## [[Keys]]
#### Forbidden Market Allure (Essence 3)
The Infernal can use this Charm against multiple characters, ignoring multiple target penalties.
#### Sense-Blinding Lightning Lure (Essence 3) (+4m)
For a four-mote surcharge, the Infernal treats the Resources rating of good or service offered as one dot higher for purposes of her bargain. The Willpower cost to resist increases to (Essence), and she succeeds automatically against characters whose Willpower is lower than her Essence. Mortals and First Circle demons can’t spend Willpower to downgrade the Obsession until the end of a story in which they obtain their desire. She can’t use this key against the same character more than once per session. It isn’t compatible with [[#Forbidden Market Allure (Essence 3)|Forbidden Market Allure]].
