The Sidereal weaves fate with a distinctive personal flair. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Sidereal’s player chooses a circumstance comparable to a specialty as her particular focus in weaving fate: “while outnumbered,” “at night,” “for love,” “against enemies of fate,” “making bad decisions,” “opposing the status quo,” etc. Her appearance often shifts subtly to reflect this focus: a Sidereal who excels when battling enemies of fate might take on a wrathful mien, while one specializing in moving among the halls of power might take on a noble, dignified bearing. When the Sidereal’s focus applies, she waives the mote cost to lower target numbers for rolls with any Ability using [[Excellencies]]. If she undertakes a prophecy related to her focus, she doesn’t suffer a complication the first time she fails a roll (p. XX). She also treats it as a basic objective for [[Craft]] projects (Exalted, p. 240), which she can benefit from in addition to the usual three. The Sidereal’s player may change her focus to reflect major character development or significant changes in the Sidereal’s life.
