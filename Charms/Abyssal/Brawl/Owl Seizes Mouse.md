*A blur of killing speed, the deathknight rips into her enemies before they can do anything but scream.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm at the beginning of a round to immediately take her turn, regardless of [[Initiative]] order. She must use it to attack an enemy at short range, reflexively moving one range band toward him. She can use any combat Ability to attack. This doesnâ€™t use her movement action for the round.
With [[Brawl]] 5, [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal can pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to steal ([[Essence]], maximum 5) [[Initiative]] from her target, which she gains, before making the attack.
## Reset 
This Charm can only be used against an enemy once per scene unless reset against him by crashing him.
