*Pra Gita hungers for the flesh of the faithless, seeking them out wherever they hide.*
When the wielder makes a roll against an enemy’s [[Guile]] that could reveal signs of faithlessness, her target suffers −2 [[Guile]]. (Her target doesn’t actually need to be unfaithful for this to apply). In combat, his [[Guile]] is reduced by his onslaught penalty instead, if it’s higher.
If successful, every three extra successes lets the wielder’s player ask the [[Storyteller]] a follow-up question related to the target’s faithlessness.
## Resonant
If successful, the wielder always receives one follow-up question, in addition to any granted by her extra successes.
