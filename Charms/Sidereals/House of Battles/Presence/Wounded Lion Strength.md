The Sidereal’s agony is more than she can contain; it spills out through her blows that her enemies might share in it. The Sidereal adds (1 + wound penalty) dice of decisive damage and post-soak withering damage. She also adds that many dice on feats of strength, ignoring wound penalties. If the Sidereal’s unarmored, she adds (1 + wound penalty) soak.
