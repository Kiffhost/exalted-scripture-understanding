*The Immaculate is keenly aware of the rhythm and circulation of her body’s vital forces, sensing bruises and cuts as disturbances in its course. Closing her eyes in a moment of intense focus, she rights the flow of her living [[Essence]] and seals her wounds.*
She rolls (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice, unmodified by other effects, and heals a level of non-aggravated damage for each success, minimum one.
