The Dragon-Blood’s burning footprints burst into a roaring conflagration, drawing in the light and heat of her anima as she speeds away. When she ignites a trail of fire with Bellows-Pumping Stride, she may use this Charm to stoke it into a bonfire (difficulty 4, Damage 5L/round). Essence fuels the bonfire for the scene even if there’s no flammable material underfoot.
