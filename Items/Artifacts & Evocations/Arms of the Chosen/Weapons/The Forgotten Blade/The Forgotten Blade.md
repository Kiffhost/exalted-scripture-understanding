Also known as the Sword of Forgetfulness, this peculiar weapon’s provenance is lost to history. Its name is a watchword in the Second Age for the elusiveness of memory — for the joy and pain of remembrance and forgetfulness — but few know it exists as more than metaphor. Indeed, almost everything about it has been forgotten, and the rare few books and stories that describe its activities agree on little other than its mysterious nature, its power to destroy memories, and its habit of vanishing from mortal ken when its owner dies. Scholarly records of the weapon’s appearance are both cryptic and contradictory, ranging from “As gray as lost dreams” to “Of a golden hue so glorious as to transcend the unforgettable.” Facet Raven’s Twelve Murders in Meru, the most accessible First Age source, describes the Sword of Forgetfulness’ blade as pure starmetal — a fabulous extravagance — bonded to a cutting edge of jet-black soulsteel. But Twelve Murders in Meru is a work of fiction and therefore unreliable. 
 
## [[Evocations]] of the Forgotten Blade

[[The Forgotten Blade]] has the power to cut away memories. This memory-excising gambit is a Psyche effect with a difficulty of the target’s base [[Resolve]]. If successful, the target loses all memory surrounding a specific person, place, or thing of the wielder’s choice — or if she prefers, a random subject determined by the Storyteller. The target doesn’t lose Abilities or Intimacies; even if he doesn’t remember why he feels a certain way, the emotion remains. However, Specialtiesrelevanttoanexcisedmemorymaybelostuntil the memory is restored. Lost memories don’t return naturally. Treat this amnesia as a Major [[Derangement]] for such healing magics as [[Soul Projection Method]] or WholenessRestoring Meditation (Exalted, pp. 334, 358). A memory-excising gambit sheds no blood and causes no pain, but leaves a fine, pale scar whose origin the victim cannot recall. [[The Forgotten Blade]] is legendarily unmemorable. Only a character attuned to it can recall what it looks like when it’soutofsight.Whilethedaiklaveisunattuned,thosewho lose sight of it forget its existence entirely, as per [[To Fall Unmourned]] (p. 83), for so long as it remains unattuned.
