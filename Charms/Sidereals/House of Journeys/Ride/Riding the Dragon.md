The Sidereal affixes a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Desirable Maiden to a boon companion’s forehead, burning with a terrible celestial light that fills her victim with an indescribable sense of shock, horror, and elation as a great and terrible transformation begins. This Charm can only be used on the Sidereal’s familiars, her mortal [[Allies]], [[Contacts]], [[Cult]], [[Followers]], Mentors, and [[Retainers]], and characters she’s used Breaking the Wild [[Mortal]] on. Affixing the prayer strip requires a difficulty 1 [[Brawl]] or [[Martial Arts]] gambit against an unwilling character. The Sidereal’s victim has a chance to tear it from his forehead before the transformation is complete. If he isn’t restrained, no roll is required; otherwise, he reflexively rolls ([[Dexterity]] + [[Athletics]]) or another appropriate pool a difficulty set by the Storyteller. If he fails, he’s too late, and the transformation sets in. A transformed character becomes a lesser elemental dragon of air or water (p. XX), the Scripture of the Desirable Maiden spelled out along his back. He gains a Defining Tie of obedience to the Sidereal and loses all other Intimacies. In combat, he immediately rolls [[Join Battle]], replacing his previous [[Initiative]]. The Sidereal’s victim reverts to his true form once this Charm ends, but he is far from unscathed. The immense spiritual toll the transformation exacts causes grievous and permanent damage to his soul and identity. The Storyteller determines the specifics: he fall into a coma, suffer total amnesia, etc. It may be possible to undo this with magic like [[Soul Projection Method]] (Exalted, p. 358).
