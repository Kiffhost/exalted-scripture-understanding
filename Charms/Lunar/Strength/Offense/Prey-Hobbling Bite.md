*Striking at joints and tendons with agonizing force, the Lunar rips away the option of escape.*
She makes a decisive attack against a lower-[[Initiative]] enemy. If she deals damage, he suffers a âˆ’1 crippling penalty on all rolls that scene. Each 10 on the damage roll increases the penalty by one, maximum ([[Strength]]). 
## Protean 

In animal shapes with crippling attacks, the Lunar adds one damage die.
