*Seven Star Alignmentâ€™s wisdom draws no distinction between the ebb and flow of combat and the subtle patterns of sorcery.*
When the wielder regains Willpower for successfully casting a spell in combat (Exalted, p. 465), she may exchange it for five Initiative. If the spell lets her make a decisive attack, she gains this Initiative before rolling the attack.
