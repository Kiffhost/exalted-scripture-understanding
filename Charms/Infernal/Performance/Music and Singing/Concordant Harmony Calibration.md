*The Infernal’s sublime harmonies cause her audience to naturally fall into eerie synchronicity.*

As long as the Infernal performs with music or song, her audience counts as having a Minor Principle of belief that teamwork and cooperation are superior to individual efforts. They must pay one Willpower to act in a way that violates that Intimacy. They must also pay one Willpower to initiate hostilities or take harmful actions unless another character initiates hostilities against them.

As the audience listens, they begin to unconsciously synchronize their movements. If multiple characters cooperate in some action, the character who makes the roll adds an automatic success on the roll. This can’t be used in combat.
## [[Keys]]
#### Crystalline Keening Trance
The cost to violate the Intimacy or take hostile actions increases to two Willpower.
