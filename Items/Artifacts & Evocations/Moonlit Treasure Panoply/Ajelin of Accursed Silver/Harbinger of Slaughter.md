Hatred hones Ajelinâ€™s edge, sharp enough to cut down even the enemies of the gods.
To use this Evocation, the wielder must have 12+ [[Initiative]]. She adds (Enmity) dice of damage to a decisive attack, and also converts up to (Enmity) attack roll extra successes to dice of damage. If this incapacitates a nontrivial enemy, the wielder rolls [[Join Battle]] with (Enmity) non-Charm bonus dice.
## Resonant
The wielder adds up to (Enmity x2) extra successes as dice of damage.
## Dissonant
The [[Initiative]] awarded by the [[Join Battle]] roll is halved, rounded up.

## Reset 
Once per scene unless reset by dealing 7+ decisive damage to a nontrivial enemy.
