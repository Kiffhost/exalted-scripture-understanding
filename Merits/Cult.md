The character is the object of organized veneration by a group of mortals. Without additional magic, humans (including the Exalted) cannot actually hear prayers directed at them, although when deep in meditation they can feel the mute moth-wing fluttering of appeals, sacrifices, and words of adoration whirling about them.
The rating of this Merit dictates the size of the character’s cult and the power she can draw from its prayers. A one-dot cult comprises only a few full-time priests and a handful of devout worshipers. A two-dot cult spans several hundred individuals, perhaps an entire large village. A three-dot cult means the character is venerated throughout a significant region, or perhaps openly rules a mighty city-state as its god-king (although this would require additional [[Merits]] to represent such influence). A four-dot cult means that an entire nation honors the character; tens of thousands offer up prayers to her, and the Wyld Hunt has surely heard her name. A five-dot cult spans much of a Direction; few Exalts indeed may claim such a vast bounty of worship, and at present, no Solar Exalt has yet done so in the Age of Sorrows.
The character may spend a [[Willpower]] point without actually losing the point a number of times per story equal to her [[Cult]] rating. Higher [[Cult]] ratings exist, allowing the character to spend one free [[Willpower]] point per scene, but such veneration is reserved for the mightiest of spirits— at present, no Exalt in the Second Age is so widely worshiped, and very few even among the mightiest of gods can boast such reverence.

#### Dragon-Blooded
Both the Realm and Lookshy forbid the direct worship of Dragon-Blooded, making this Merit unlawful and heretical to possess. Prasadi Dragon-Blooded and outcastes face no such restrictions.
