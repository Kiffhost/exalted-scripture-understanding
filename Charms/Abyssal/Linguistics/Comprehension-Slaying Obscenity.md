*The Abyssal pens a missive that is not merely incomprehensible but actively antithetical to understanding.*
The Abyssal makes a special (Manipulation + Linguistics) influence roll to compose a message to a single target. His Intimacies don’t modify his Resolve against this influence. If successful, he loses the capacity to understand or communicate in any language.
However, he can understand Infinite Blasphemy Glossolalia’s anti-language as if he were a creature of darkness (p. XX).
This influence costs (Abyssal’s Essence) Willpower to resist, instantly restoring knowledge of all lost languages. Otherwise, it lasts until this Charm ends.
Mortals, Essence 1 ghosts, and trivial characters can’t resist.
A repurchase reduces this Charm’s mote cost by the intensity of the target’s strongest Intimacy based on fear or antipathy toward social interactions or belief in the meaninglessness of things. It also lets the Abyssal convey this Psyche effect through spoken influence.
