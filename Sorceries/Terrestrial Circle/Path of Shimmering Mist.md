*The sorcerer gathers a constellation of dewdrops in her cupped palms, then sends them flying with a single breath, forming a cloud of mist to be her path.*

The sorcerer creates a cloud of mist that reaches out ahead of her, coalescing into a solid pathway beneath her feet as she walks. When she moves, the trail of mist lingers behind her, forming a path that others may walk on. However, if the sorcerer moves further than long range away from part of the path, that portion dissolves into mist. At its full size, the path can hold a group equivalent to the sorcerer’s Circle and either a Size 2 battle group of human-sized characters or a yeddim-drawn wagon. 

The sorcerer and others walking the path are wreathed in cool mists, negating penalties from severe heat and reducing damage from heat-based environmental hazards by one die. While traveling over land, they’re held just above whatever they walk on by the mist, letting them cross unimpeded over surfaces too flimsy to bear their weight, including water. The path can likewise circumvent some kinds of difficult terrain and environmental hazards, if appropriate.

The sorcerer can even use the path to walk on thin air, so long as she remains within short range of the ground. She can move vertically up or down by tracing out a sloping or spiraling path. Ascending this way counts as difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199) when the sorcerer first does it, but not for those who follow a vertical path once she’s done so.

The sorcerer can choose to step off the path, leaving it stationary. However, it disperses on the end of her next turn unless she returns to it, ending this spell. Smash attacks and similar forms of forced movement can also knock the sorcerer from the path. This spell isn’t compatible with mounted movement, flight, shipboard travel, or the like. 

# Control
Any mist or fog the sorcerer comes near begins to swirl and billow unnaturally, moving in time with her breathing. She can sculpt the path with greater ease, adding (Essence) dice on movement actions she takes while on it and letting her ascend vertically without it counting as difficult terrain. 
# Distortion
(Goal Number: 10)
Distortion turns the mists freezing cold. Those on the path suffer a −2 penalty on all actions and suffer an environmental hazard with difficulty (distorting sorcerer’s Essence or 3), Damage 1L/round.
