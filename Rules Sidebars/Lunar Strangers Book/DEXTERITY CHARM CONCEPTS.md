Face-Thieving Legerdemain (Essence 2;
Nest-Raiding Slyness): Perform a [[Sacred Hunt]] that
concludes when you steal whatever’s most valuable to someone or something they have a positive
Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] to while they’re nearby.
Flowing Moonsilver Infiltration (Essence 3;
Shifting Octopus Trick): The Lunar’s flesh warps to
fit through a space too small for her. Minuscule Size
shapes can slip through even the slightest crack;
Tiny Creatures can fit through finger-sized openings;
humans and larger forms can fit through openings
the size of their head, and Legendary Size creatures
can fit through anything a person could.
