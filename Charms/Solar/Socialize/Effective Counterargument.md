Once per scene, the Solar may intercede in a persuade action she is witnessing in order to change the target’s mind. After the initiate has rolled his persuasion but before Resolve is applied, the Solar may make a (Wits + Socialize) roll to persuade the subject to reject the initiate’s influence. For every two successes she gains on this roll, the target’s Resolve is boosted by one.
