*The Sidereal has broadened her understanding of archery beyond all limitations, wielding concepts and philosophies as arrows.*
Upon purchasing this Charm, the Sidereal chooses a Sidereal Martial Art. She can learn it without needing the requisite [[Martial Arts]] [[Charms]]. She can use it with all [[Archery]] weapons, though this doesn’t make it compatible with other styles that use them (unless the Sidereal’s also purchases this Charm for them). All her [[Archery]] [[Charms]] count as Versatile for that style and as [[Martial Arts]] for any of its [[Charms]] that interact with other styles, like [[Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form]] (p. XX). This Charm can be purchased any number of times.
