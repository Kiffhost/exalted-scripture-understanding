No peril can keep the Lunar from her goal. Upon encountering an [[Environmental Hazards|environmental hazard]], trap, or naval obstacle along a course charted with [[Lodestone Reckoning Manner]], she rolls ([[Wits]] + [Awareness, [[Sail]], or Survival]) against its difficulty. She can add successes with [[Lodestone Reckoning Manner]]. Success reveals a safe route, allowing her and up to ([[Essence]] x2) companions to bypass the peril without rolling, no matter how implausible this may be. Mounts donâ€™t count toward the limit on companions. 
## Protean 

In an animal shape native to the environment in which the peril originates, the Lunar doubles 9s. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape is migratory can learn this as a [[Perception]] Charm.
