*Soldiers shed their human skins as the Lunar works her witchcraft, emerging as snarling beasts or helpless prey.*
The Lunar transforms a battle group of willing mortals within medium range into an animal shape she possesses, except for Legendary [[Size]] shapes, using the normal rules for Lunar shapeshifting (Lunars, p. 131). The battle group’s dice limit for shapeshifting is (Lunar’s [[War]]).
Additionally, the combination of animal prowess and human intelligence grants [[Might]] 1.
If the Lunar has [[Witch-Among-Swine Spite]] (Lunars, p.
209), she can use this Charm to transform an enemy battle group with a difficulty 5 gambit, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + {Lore, [[Occult]], or Presence}) against its [[Resolve]] for the attack. Enemies use the lower of their dice pools or the animal’s, or 3 dice if the animal lacks a pool.
This Charm’s transformation normally last one scene, but willing battle groups extend this to one hour outside of combat. If the Lunar renews it once the hour expires, she waives its [[Willpower]] cost.

## Reset 
Once per scene.
