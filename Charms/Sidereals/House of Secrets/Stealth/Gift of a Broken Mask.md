*The Sidereal affixes a violet memorandum designating someone an honorary member of the Fivescore The sundered resplendent destiny is cast off as a corpse of appropriate appearance, though it unravels into gossamer threads under physical examination. Observers’ memories of the corpse and its strange nature are subject to arcane fate.*
