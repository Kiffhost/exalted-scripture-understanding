*If the Infernal’s suspect deviates from her profile, the fault must lie in him — her mental model is far superior to reality.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after a successful profile character roll or a case scene roll to investigate someone’s acts, forming a mental model of her suspect based on the information the roll revealed any other evidence available to her. She gains the following benefits:
- She adds (Perception/2, rounded up) dice on Bureaucracy, Investigation, and Lore rolls that benefit from the information the profile provides.
- She adds +2 Resolve against influence that seeks to convince her the target acted in a way that diverges from her profile.
- At times, she glimpses him in mirrors, though his face is always obscured. This provides a general sense of what he looks like, if she’s unfamiliar, and the Storyteller may use these visions to update the players on his current appearance.
- [[All Things Betray]] alerts her to anyone who fits the profile or any sequence of events that’s consistent with the profiled character’s customary methodology.

If the Infernal witnesses her target act in a way that’s completely out of character for the profile she’s developed for him, this Charm ends and she forms a negative Minor Tie to him as her mental model of him shatters. Examples include violating a Defining Intimacy or betraying what seemed to be a close ally. She rolls three dice and gains Limit equal to her successes.
