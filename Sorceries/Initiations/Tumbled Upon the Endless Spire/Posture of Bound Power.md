Once per scene, the sorcerer can gain (Essence + 3) additional sorcerous motes from a Shape Sorcery action by assuming a posture of stillness. She suffers −2 Evasion until the end of her next turn and can’t take movement actions until then. She can’t use this ritual on a turn where she’s already taken a movement action. Using this ritual when casting a control spell doesn’t count towards the once-per-scene limit.
