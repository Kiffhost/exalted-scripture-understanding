Even the mightiest herds can be slaughtered by those who know where to strike. The Lunar can use Soul-Piercing Predator Gaze against a culture, rolling (Perception + [Bureaucracy, Investigation, or Socialize]) opposing the Guile of that group’s leader or of the most prominent figure opposing her efforts. Normally, this takes (10 – Essence) days of interaction with the targeted group, although the Storyteller may rule that it takes longer for especially large, widespread, or decentralized groups. Success reveals the culture’s greatest weakness — a leader who lacks his subordinates’ respect; insufficient funding; a powerful rival’s enmity; etc. — and grants a temporary specialty in exploiting it.
