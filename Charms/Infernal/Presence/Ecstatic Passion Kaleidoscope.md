*The Infernal is a fickle creature, her heart a storm of wild and mercurial passions.*

The Infernal is overcome by an emotion of her choice, as if she’d been affected by an inspire roll. She may alter one of her Minor or Major Intimacies that’s based on emotion, changing it to fit the inspired emotion. She can’t change Intimacies based on positive emotion to negative emotions, or vice versa. Inspired with spiteful malice, she might turn a Tie of fear to one of hatred. Overcome with ecstatic joy, she could turn a Principle of “I enjoy quiet, calm, and contemplation” to “I delight in raucous revelry.”

With Presence 5, Essence 3, the Infernal can use this Charm to alter Defining Intimacies. She can also change Intimacies based on positive emotion to negative, or vice versa.
## Reset
The Infernal can’t alter the same Intimacy more than once per story.
