Purge the Tarnished Silver (Essence 1;
Bone-Mending Technique): The Lunar anoints
someone’s wounds with her blood to convert aggravated damage to lethal.
Confounding Wisdom Guidance (Essence 1; Inevitable Genius Insight): An organization speeds its
work on a project as long as its members follow
a strange prohibition, ritual, or geas given by the
Lunar. If it doesn’t heed her, the project is impeded
instead.
Devil-Swine Imprisonment (Essence 3; Cage of
Horn and Sinew): After dealing a meaningful defeat
to a spirit or fae, the Lunar can bind him with Cage
of Horn and Sinew, rather than needing to exorcise
him. This upgrade also applies to Spirit-Sealing
Talisman.
Fever Dream Odyssey (Essence 3; Midnight Soul
Reprieve): Help someone by entering their mindscape while they’re in an altered state of consciousness — intoxication, hallucination, feverish
delirium — or in the Wyld. Potential uses include
restoring erased memories, searching for evidence of possession, confronting Derangements in
symbolic encounters, and more.
Moon-Graced Mystic's Hands (Essence 3;
Burning Moonfire Mind): Commit the costs of
Flesh-Sculpting Art, Night’s Mercy Panacea, or
Plague-Swallowing Kiss to extend their benefits
to all relevant Medicine rolls for one scene. This
doesn’t apply to repeat attempts at treating the
same patient.
Herd-Healing Mercy (Essence 5; Moon-Graced
Mystic’s Hands): The Lunar can use Bone-Mending Technique, Midnight Soul Reprieve, or Starfish-and-Salamander Meditation to treat multiple
patients simultaneously, including large numbers
of trivial characters.
