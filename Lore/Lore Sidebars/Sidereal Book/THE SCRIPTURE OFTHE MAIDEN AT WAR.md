Once, there was a maiden…
…whose battles called her far from home.
She slew the thing she feared most, and conquered the land that feared her.
As she fought, far away, she knew her children
needed guidance.
She knew they faced tyrants.
She knew they faced fear.
In her homeland, things were broken.
So, she held her hand before the sun, cast a shadow
on the world, and drowned the troubles of her home
in darkness.
“Survival’s a long reach,” she said.
