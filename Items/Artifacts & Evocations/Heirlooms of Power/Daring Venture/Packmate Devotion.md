After bonding over the course of many adventures, [[HUNDRED RIVERS, THE WANDERING WOLF|Hundred Rivers]] accepts the wielder as a lifelong packmate. He rejects any influence that would cause him to betray his master or weaken or alter his Tie to her as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). He’ll only weaken his Tie to his master at the end of the session if she betrays him outright. [[HUNDRED RIVERS, THE WANDERING WOLF|Hundred Rivers]] gains two Initiative when he witnesses his master suffer decisive damage. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation cannot be purchased with experience points. When [[HUNDRED RIVERS, THE WANDERING WOLF|Hundred Rivers]]’ Tie toward the wielder reaches the Defining level, the wielder awakens this Evocation at no cost.
