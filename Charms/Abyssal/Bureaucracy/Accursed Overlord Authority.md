*The Abyssal rules with an iron fist, shaping her subordinates to her vision of the world.*
The Abyssal expresses one of her Major or Defining Intimacies through her leadership of an organization, requiring her to spend a scene engaged with that organization in a way that supports the Intimacy. Examples include making a dramatic speech to her followers, promulgating a set of rules, or employing Eloquent Example Inspiration.
All organization members who witness this or hear of it from others intuitively realize the Abyssal’s Intimacy.
This has the following effects
- All organization members who are aware of the Abyssal’s Intimacy gain its benefits as if they had it themselves, but it can’t be leveraged against them with social influence. A character who violates the Intimacy loses this benefit.
- The Abyssal adds (Essence) dice on influence rolls against group members that align with the Intimacy.
- The Abyssal adds (Essence) on Awareness, Investigation, and Socialize rolls against group members to uncover violations of the Intimacy.
If the Abyssal chooses a negative Tie, a positive Tie whose object is dead or undead, or a Principle that expresses a positive view on death, the added dice are non-Charm, and this Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes.
The Abyssal can stack this Charm to affect multiple organizations and can use it up to (Essence) times on each organization.
With a Bureaucracy 5, Essence 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a seven-mote surcharge to actually impose the Intimacy on organization members rather than only granting its benefits. Characters with positive Defining Ties to the Abyssal when she uses this Charm can’t voluntarily erode the imposed Intimacy. If such a character has the imposed Intimacy at Defining intensity, they can treat any influence it opposes as unacceptable. Resisting this influence requires spending three Willpower per day over (Abyssal’s Essence) different days, after which a character can begin weakening the Tie. The Abyssal can only have one such enhanced use of Accursed Overlord Authority at a time.
