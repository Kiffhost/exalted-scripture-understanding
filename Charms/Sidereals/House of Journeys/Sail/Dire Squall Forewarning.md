The Sidereal speaks of the ocean’s perils and seafarer’s sins, condemning a ship to Mercury’s disfavor unless its captain heeds her warning. The Sidereal gives a fearsome admonition to a ship’s captain, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[Sail]]) to introduce a fact about a disaster that will befall the ship. As with [[Meticulous Disaster Agenda]], the Sidereal’s player chooses the general nature of the disaster. A peril that would challenge a ship of mortals is difficulty 3; if the Sidereal wishes to pose a challenge worthy of supernatural characters aboard the ship, this increases to (5 + the highest [[Essence]] among them). She can’t predict such great perils unless a supernatural character of appropriate [[Essence]] is aboard the ship. If successful, the disaster occurs at a time chosen by the Sidereal, though she must give the ship at least (5 + highest [[Essence]] of characters aboard ship) days to prepare. If it occurs onscreen — typically when it’s used on player characters or when a Sidereal player character arranges to be present for it — the Storyteller should determine the details of the disaster to make it a challenge for the ship. If it occurs offscreen, resolve it as an opposed roll against the Sidereal’s using the most appropriate (Attribute + Ability). Whoever aboard the ship has the highest dice pool rolls. The Sidereal’s warning must include a route that the target ship can take to ensure the disaster never happens: “head due east,” “take shelter in this nearby cove,” “stay in port,” etc. By default, it can be no greater than an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216); 3+ extra successes lets her choose a serious task, while 6+ allows a life-changing task. Regardless of severity, the journey must be feasible within the time given. The disaster is also averted if the Sidereal ends this Charm prematurely.
