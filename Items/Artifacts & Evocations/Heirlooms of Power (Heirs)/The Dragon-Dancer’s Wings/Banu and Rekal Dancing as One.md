## Resonant
This Evocation can only be awakened by a wielder resonant with the Dragon-Dancer’s Wings.
Reenacting the famed dragon-dance of Nalako Jathri, the wielder brings peace to troubled minds just as Jathri reconciled Banu and Rekal. This Evocation can free a character from a Psyche effect or cause a Derangement to subside.
The wielder must first use either Passion-Flaring Flamenco or Soothing Snowfall Waltz on her target — Passion-Flaring Flamenco for Psyche effects or Derangements that cause unnatural passivity, languor, or emotionlessness; Soothing Snowfall Waltz for those that provoke the victim to irrational action or fill them with uncontrollable emotions.
The wielder makes a special (Appearance + Performance) inspire roll. Against Psyche effects, this follows the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221), requiring the target to call upon a Defining Intimacy in the Decision Point. If he does and spends one Willpower, the Psyche effect is terminated. Against Derangements, the roll is made at difficulty (Derangement x 2), with success lowering its intensity by one step (or suppressing Minor Derangements entirely) until the story’s end.
This Evocation can only be used once per story.
