As the Sidereal’s weapon strikes true, it gives off a soft yellow radiance that calls to things traveling through the air, beckoning them to join it. If the Sidereal’s decisive attack deals damage, her weapon is embedded in her enemy where it struck him, increasing his wound penalty by one as its radiance draws dust, debris, and the occasional insect into his wounds. When a ranged attack against another character misses, the Sidereal may pay one [[Willpower]] to redirect it against him. The attacker makes a new attack roll, retaining all effects that applied to the first roll. Decisive attacks use the Sidereal’s [[Initiative]] to calculate damage rather than the attacker’s and reset her to base if successful. Any [[Initiative]] a withering attack would award goes to the Sidereal. A character may pay three [[Initiative]] to roll ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) roll opposing the Sidereal’s ([[Wits]] + [[Thrown]]) roll, dislodging the weapon and ending this Charm’s effects if he succeeds. This is a miscellaneous action that can’t be flurried. Outside of combat, it can be removed with a difficulty 3 ([[Intelligence]] + [[Medicine]]) roll that takes five minutes to perform.
