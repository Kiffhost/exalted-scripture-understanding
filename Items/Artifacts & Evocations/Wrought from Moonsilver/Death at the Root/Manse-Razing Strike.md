The ultimate Evocation of Death at the Root is its most infamous, the awful power to fell the towers of the mighty. It can only be used against a demesne or manse that’s completely suppressed with Cutting the WorldRoot. The wielder begins an extended (Intelligence + Craft [Geomancy]) action to completely destroy that site, cutting away those features of the terrain or architecture that are most vital to its geomancy. This has difficulty (its Merit rating), goal number 40, and a one-day interval. Success permanently destroys it, entailing massive damage to the structures of a manse or the landscape of a demesne. On failure, the wielder can’t use this Evocation against that site again. This Evocation can only be used once per story.
