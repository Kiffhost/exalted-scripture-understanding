*Knowing the doom that awaits her, the Sidereal laughs at all other dangers.*
The Sidereal experiences a vision of her own end. The Storyteller should reveal what he thinks is the most likely way for the Sidereal to die during this story based on her current conditions — her bane. If the Storyteller doesn’t have anything in mind, the Sidereal’s player chooses a bane. The bane should be comparable in scope to a specialty, like “swords,” “poison,” or “a loved one.” It can’t be a specific person, object, or location.
The Sidereal’s grim foreknowledge grants the following benefits
- She adds (Perception) soak and Hardness (Essence + Perception) against all sources of harm other than her bane. If she’s unarmored, both of these are increased by +2.
- If she’s incapacitated by something other than her bane, it’s never immediately fatal, allowing a chance for medical intervention, rescues, or the like to save her.
- She’s immune to threaten rolls and other influence based on fear unless her bane is the reason for her fear.
- Once per day, she can gain one Willpower by spending a scene interacting with her bane or in its presence, accepting death as her constant companion. There must be a chance of her being harmed by the bane for it to qualify, even if it’s only from wielding a sword carelessly or similar acts of minor recklessness.
- She waives Expected Pain’s cost against perils other than her bane.
If the Sidereal faces life-threatening peril from her bane and survives, this Charm ends. The thrill of survival sets her current temporary Willpower to 10, which can raise her above her permanent Willpower. She loses all Limit.
## Reset
Once per story. This Charm doesn’t need to be reset if it’s ended by surviving the bane.
