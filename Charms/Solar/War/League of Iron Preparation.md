*Reaching out to the hearts of her charges with an impassioned speech and fatal purpose, the Solar invokes their reasons for fighting.*
This Charm is activated when the Exalt begins the long, arduous process of drilling her soldiers. As she toughens them with want and rain, she reminds them of the hardships they have endured at the hands of their tormentors. When they hunger, her words feed them. When they shiver, her exhortations warm them. Fed by the Solarâ€™s will, they suffer less from long marches, empty bellies, or harsh climates. When the Lawgiver is finished drilling these troops, her commitment to the Charm ends, and her soldiers are forever improved: they cannot suffer demoralizing effects (such as the Demoralize stratagem on page 212) that are not created by Reflexive or Simple types of magic. In addition, ignore penalties on the Strategic Maneuver roll having to do with hunger, bad weather, or the physical exhaustion associated with long marches over difficult terrain.
