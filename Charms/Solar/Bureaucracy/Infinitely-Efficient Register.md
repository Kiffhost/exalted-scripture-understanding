As long as the Lawgiver’s organization has succeeded at one challenging project in the previous season, her bureaucracy automatically completes one project within its scope without ever undertaking it. Once per story, the Exalt may travel to an isolated section of her business headquarters where she will find the proof of a completed task. She might find useful tools, resources, deeds, valuable paperwork, and so forth. The Storyteller should select items which will prove of some use to the Solar each time she decides to invoke this Charm. The more powerful her organization, the better the discovered spoils will be. Note that use of this Charm does not itself count as completion of a challenging project.
