Spouting unforgivable insults or baseless slander, the Lunar makes herself the irresistible object of her enemy’s ire. She rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + [Performance or Presence]) against one character to inspire him with rage toward her. An affected character can’t attack anyone but the Lunar that scene. This extends to any hostile effect, even those not modeled as attacks. Area-of-effect attacks can include other characters as long as they also include the Lunar. If the victim’s Resolve is beaten but he spends Willpower to resist, he still takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls against anyone but the Lunar that scene. Both the influence and penalty end if the Lunar is incapacitated, withdraws, or otherwise leaves combat. 
## Protean 

InshapesthatthetargethasaTieofangerorhatred toward, he must enter a Decision Point and invoke another Intimacy of equal or greater intensity to resist. Additionally, the penalty on attacks increases to (his Intimacy).
