Once, there was a maiden…
...who ate 236 leaves. She had to, because otherwise she’d forget where she came from, and that
would make everyone very sad, or, possibly, very
happy.
She found herself in a woods full of monsters, impelled toward their cook pot. “Do you want to cook
me?” she asked. “Or do you just think that’s where
maidens belong?”
There was a crack in the cook pot’s bottom that
let in the sky.
She started to squirm through the crack, but then
she saw that the clouds carried chains and the
wind was their manacles.
As the monsters pulled her back, she called to the
stones and she called to the sky, but it was the
night that came to her aid, and in the night, fire
and pain. “Why should you help me?” she asked.
“To know the world is to serve it,” they said.
