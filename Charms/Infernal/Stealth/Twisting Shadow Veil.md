*The Infernal disappears into darkness, like a demon fleeing into the Ebon Dragon’s shadow to escape the Green Sun.*

While the Infernal is in darkness or dim light that imposes a visibility penalty, she adds that many dice on a Stealth roll and ignores that many points of penalties.

The Infernal can also use this Charm on Join Battle rolls made while concealed.
## [[Keys]]
#### Fang in the Dark
If the Infernal wins Join Battle and uses her first turn to make a surprise attack against an enemy with lower Initiative, it doesn’t break her concealment.
#### Witching Hour Secrets (Stealth 4, Essence 2) (+2m, 1wp)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one hour. She must still pay [[#Midnight Killer Mastery (Stealth 5, Essence 2, Fang in the Dark) (+2m)|Midnight Killer Mastery]]’s surcharge to gain its benefit on unexpected attacks.
#### Midnight Killer Mastery (Stealth 5, Essence 2, [[#Fang in the Dark]]) (+2m)
The Infernal can pay a two-mote surcharge to use this Charm on an unexpected attack. She adds dice equal to the visibility penalty on the attack roll and also adds that many dice of decisive damage or post-soak withering damage.
