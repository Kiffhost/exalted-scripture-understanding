*Whirling Starfall Volley Sunflash’s anima banner reaches up to the heavens as it flares iconic, haling Kiragaru to appear before the wielder.*
The god of killing at a distance introduces himself if they haven’t already met, and may question the wielder to gauge her worth as a bearer of [[Sunflash]]. Upon the conclusion of this conversation, the Storyteller may decide that Kiragaru deems the wielder already worthy, or decide that a further test of character is required. He and the wielder’s player should discuss a suitable trial that can easily be integrated into the current story. Once Kiragaru is satisfied, he grants a miraculous boon. 
- Kiragaru can awaken the wielder’s own latent potential,grantingheraSolarThrownCharm,oneof Sunflash’s [[Evocations]], or any other combat Charm compatible with the weapon. She must meet all of the Charm’s prerequisites, but treats her permanent [[Essence]] as one higher to determine if she meets the minimum to learn the Charm. 
- Kiragaru can consecrate [[Sunflash]] by imbuing it with one of his own spirit [[Charms]], which the current wielder may use as though it were an Evocation. Unlike [[Evocations]], these [[Charms]] need not flow from the weapon’s themes, instead reflecting the miracles of the god of killing at a distance. Additionally, Sunflash’s anima banner must be at iconic before a greater miracle can be used. 
- If Kiragaru is invoked in battle, he won’t join in combat directly, but instead bestows a potent blessing on [[Sunflash]] that lasts the rest of the scene. Its anima banner remains at bonfire no matter how many levels of its anima are spent, even if one of its [[Evocations]] would normally reset its anima. Any levels of anima that [[Sunflash]] would gain are instead converted into five motes that may be spent on Sunflash’s [[Evocations]], vanishing at the end of the wielder’s next turn if not spent. 
- As a celestial god, Kiragaru holds considerable political and bureaucratic sway in Heaven. Examples of favors he could confer include arranging a meeting between the wielder and another god, sending lion-dogs or other magisterial agents of Heaven to investigate a corrupt spirit, or inflicting red tape and delay on a Sidereal Exalt hunting the wielder. 
- If none of the above effects are appropriate, the Storyteller and player can work together to design a unique blessing. These should be comparable in strength to the other options, and within the thematic purview that the Storyteller defines for Kiragaru. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) that upholds either a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards Kiragaru or a Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Principle]] that the god has instilled in her. !!Specialactivationcost:ThisEvocationawakensatnoexperience!! point cost for a Solar that meets its prerequisites.
