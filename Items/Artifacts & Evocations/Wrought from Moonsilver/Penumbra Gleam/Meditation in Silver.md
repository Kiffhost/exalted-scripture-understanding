As the wielder practices and drills in front of Penumbra Gleam, her reflection comes to life, eager to offer suggestions and critique. After several hours under its guidance, she makes an instill roll against herself with (Perception + Integrity) to erode an Intimacy expressing pride or bravado, or create or strengthen one expressing humility or frustration with herself. She banks Reflection equal to her total successes on this roll, maximum (Perception + Melee). She can spend up to (Perception/2, rounded up) Reflection on a Melee attack to reroll that many non-1 failures, and can spend Reflection in place of Initiative when taking a full defense. She can stack Reflection from multiple uses of this Evocation; she need not commit the cost of subsequent uses. 

## Resonant

As long as the wielder has a Major or Defining Intimacy expressing self-doubt, self-loathing, or inadequacy, she adds (higher of Essence or 3) to her maximum Reflection.
