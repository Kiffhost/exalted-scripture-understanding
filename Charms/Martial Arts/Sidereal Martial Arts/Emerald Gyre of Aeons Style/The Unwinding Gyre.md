*Sighting along the flow of time, the stylist severs a course of events from its cause.*
The stylist can use this Charm after an enemy succeeds on an action, rolling ([[Intelligence]] + [[Lore]]) against his roll’s successes. If the action was unrolled, he rolls an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) pool. If the stylist succeeds, the consequences of that action: an attack deals no damage, movement is reversed, a drawn weapon returns to its sheath, an influence roll has no effect. The enemy isn’t refunded any costs he paid as part of that effect. This can’t be used against actions that affect no one but the enemy, like an [[Awareness]] roll to notice something, an introduce fact roll, or using a Simple Charm that confers a benefit on him without affecting others.
Alternatively, the stylist can use this Charm to undo a similar occurrence that wasn’t caused by a character: a field catching flame, a building collapsing, Wyld mutation, etc. She rolls against the difficulty of an environmental hazard or similar effect, or the difficulty it would have taken to stop the event from occurring if there isn’t one associated with it, maximum 10. If the stylist uses [[Futures Best Avoided]] against an ambush, she can use this Charm to defend if the attack hits.
## Enlightenment
This Charm can be used to undo actions with no external effect. 
## Reset
Once per scene.
