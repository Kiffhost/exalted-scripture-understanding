*The Abyssal’s words are too captivating to ignore and too beautiful to abandon.*
As the Abyssal pens a text, she imbues it with mind-warping power, making a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Linguistics]]) influence roll with ([[Essence]]) automatic successes and ignoring multiple target penalties.
Target’s Intimacies don’t modify their [[Resolve]] against this. Anyone who reads a single line of the text is exposed to this influence, and must continue reading the text for at least (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) minutes or until he’s finished.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can use this Charm with spoken influence, rolling as above. Affected characters are entranced by her voice, even if they don’t understand her, taking no actions for as long as she continues to speak.
Both versions of this Charm can’t be resisted with [[Willpower]], but a character is freed from the Psyche effect if he’s attacked or placed at risk of direct physical danger.
