*The Lunar bridges the divide between mortal society and the spirit world, advocating for the people under her protection in the courts of divinities.*
She gains +1 [[Resolve]] and [[Guile]] against spirits and fae, and such beings must hear her out peacefully when she speaks so long as she and her companions remain peaceful and inoffensive. An entity may pay one [[Willpower]] to ignore the Lunar, or two [[Willpower]] to initiate hostilities against her and her companions. If the Lunar or any of her companions engage in combat, even in self-defense, further spirits and fae may attack without spending [[Willpower]]. 
## Protean 

Spirits and fae with positive Major or Defining Ties toward the Lunarâ€™s shape must enter [[Decision Points]] to resist this Charm, citing another [[Intimacy]] of equal or greater strength.
