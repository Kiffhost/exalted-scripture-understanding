This Torment inflicts a body-altering Shaping effect: transforming a victim to a brass statue, burning out his eyes in a flash of viridian fire, transmuting him into a lowly demon beast, etc. The Infernal chooses an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) pool for this transformation. She rolls her pool against her target’s [[Resolve]] whenever he would be exposed to her Torment, inflicting the curse on a success. For mortals, First Circle demons and trivial characters, the curse takes effect immediately, warping her target’s body as described.

A nontrivial character suffers a lesser version of the curse. He first suffers a −3 penalty to any dice pool appropriate to the curse’s effect. This reflects the curse slowly taking hold in a way that is still reversable, e.g., his body is slowed by partially transforming to brass.

When the time is right, the Shaping runs its course and inflicts the full version of the curse. This is represented by the Infernal making a special gambit using this power’s dice pool against her target’s [[Resolve]]. Its difficulty is (target’s Essence), or (target’s Essence +3) for curses whose effects will be incapacitating or fatal within the course of the scene. This gambit can be made from short range, though it’s limited to close range if it this power has a touch vector. Success inflicts the full version of the transformation.

Partial transformations end once the Infernal leaves [[Devil-Body]]. Completed transformations are permanent, though the Infernal can name circumstances under which they can be broken.
