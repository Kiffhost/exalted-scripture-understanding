This Charm represents the blinding speed of the Solar’s genius hands, honed by a lifetime of practice.
[[Shrike Saving Discretion]] permanently enhances its prerequisite—when the Solar launches a successful decisive attack with [[Swarm-Culling Instinct]], upon returning to base [[Initiative]], she gains bonus [[Initiative]] equal to the 9s and 10s on the previous attack’s damage roll.
