**All Exalted possess this Merit at no cost. Spirits also universally possess this Merit, as do the Fair Folk.**

The character heals quickly and perfectly, with no risk of lingering complications. Only the most grievous of injuries leave any hint of scarring, and the character’s healing is like a slow form of regeneration, flawlessly mending severed muscles and nerves, torn ligaments, and shattered bones. Unless a body part is completely severed or destroyed, it is restored to perfect working condition once healed. Finally, the character’s wounds never become [[Infected Wounds|infected]]. For more detail on healing from injuries, see page 173.
