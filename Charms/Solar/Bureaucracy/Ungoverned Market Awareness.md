*The Solar is so attuned to the flow of trade that she can sense any time a character within range of her senses uses the [[Bureaucracy]] or [[Larceny]] Ability to make a transaction.*
This does not overwhelm her in market settings. She may simply ignore the proceedings, but she may also choose to sweep for particular transactions. This may aid her in locating characters with market specialties indicated by the prerequisite.
