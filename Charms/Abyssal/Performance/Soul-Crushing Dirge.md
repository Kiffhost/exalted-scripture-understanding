*Flavor Text*
The Abyssal makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + [[Performance]]) inspire roll over the course of at least a minute. For each target, the influence is supported by their strongest [[Intimacy]] they have that’s relevant to the inspired emotion. The deathknight need not know of these Intimacies, nor are they revealed to her.*
The Abyssal can’ If the emotion is positive, the chosen [[Intimacy]] will typically be one that involves other, negative emotions or that relates to death somehow. A song of long would exploit a god’s Tie of grief for his dead lover, even if his Tie of love for their children is stronger.
Affected characters must act on the inspired emotion (Exalted, p. 217) in a way that supports the targeted [[Intimacy]]. The [[Storyteller]] should choose actions that support the Abyssal player’s intent in using this Charm, but the deathknight’s targets may still act unpredictably, especially if she hasn’t used read intentions actions in advance.
