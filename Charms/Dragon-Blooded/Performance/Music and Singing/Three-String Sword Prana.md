Drawing on her mastery of an instrument, the Dragon-Blood suffuses its music with anima, unleashing a deadly attack with her song. She can send spectral blades flying at a foe with a strum of her sanxian, play a bone-shattering trill on a flute, create a phantasmal beast that moves in time with the beat of her drums, or similarly spectacular displays of martial prowess. This is a decisive attack rolled with (Wits + Performance) against an enemy out to medium range. With the Storyteller’s permission, the Exalt’s stunt can grant this attack any weapon tags (Exalted, pp. 585-590) that fit the manifestation of the attack. She rolls her Initiative for damage as usual, doubling 10s. If the Dragon-Blood is using other Performance Charms that require her to continue playing to maintain their effect, using Three-String Sword Prana counts as continuing her performance on the round she uses it.
