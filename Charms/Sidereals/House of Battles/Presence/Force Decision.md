Sensing a moment of indecision, the Sidereal injects her own opinion into the matter. When the Sidereal witnesses a character faced with a choice between multiple options, she may reflexively make a special (Charisma + Presence) persuade roll, putting him into a Decision Point if she succeeds. She names the option she wishes to choose and cites one of her own Intimacies that supports it. He must then either cite an Intimacy of equal or greater intensity opposing that option or pay one Willpower or make the choice chosen by the Sidereal. She can’t choose an option her target isn’t aware of, though she’s free to suggest options before using this Charm. The Sidereal can’t be perceived as this effect’s source. If the Sidereal knows Wise Choice (p. XX), she can use it reflexively to evaluate her target’s options before she chooses one.
