*Surrendering to instinct and [[Essence]], the Lunar lets predatory impulse drive her toward her prey at blinding speed.*
She rushes an enemy within medium range. If successful, she automatically advances one range band toward him on each of his next two turns, in addition to her normal movement, instead of a rushâ€™s usual effect. If she uses this Charm together with [[Ferocious Hound Pursuit]], she instead instantly flashes into close range with her target.
