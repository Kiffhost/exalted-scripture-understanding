*As the constellations of the House of Endings cross the sky in their arc, the Exalt’s slung stone arcs to follow an inescapable destiny of death.*
This Evocation, which requires the wielder to have [[Initiative]] 10+, is a decisive attack carrying ([[Essence]]) points of Doom. She ignores up to (Doom) points of penalties on the attack roll, and subtracts (Doom) from the target’s [[Defense]] and [[Hardness]]. A successful hit doubles 10s on the damage roll. This Evocation can be used once per scene, unless reset by incapacitating a non-trivial opponent or routing a battle group. 

## Dissonant

The wielder doesn’t subtract (Doom) from [[Defense]]. 

## Resonant

If the wielder has [[Occult]] 3+ (or [[Occult]] 1+ and a specialty in astrology), she can meditate with the Jess beneath the night sky for one scene to seek an enemy’s death in the stars as a difficulty 3 ([[Perception]] + [[Occult]]) roll. If successful, this Evocation carries ([[Essence]] + 2) Doom whenever used against the chosen enemy until the next sunset. On failure, she cannot retry that night.
