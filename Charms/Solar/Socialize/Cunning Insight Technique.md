Any time a Lawgiver witnesses another character dispute or reject a claim—typically a successful application of [[Resolve]] against a social influence action—she may activate this Charm, allowing the player to speculate on one of the character’s attached Intimacies. For example, a Solar who witnesses a magistrate refusing to take a bribe might guess that he values justice. The Storyteller then must truthfully affirm or deny the accuracy of the player’s speculation. This Charm does not guarantee success, but allows the Solar to piece together a clearer picture of a target by association or at least elimination. Intimacies guessed correctly become known to the Solar without a doubt.
