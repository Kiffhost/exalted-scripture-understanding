As the Lunar toils at her forge of wonders, the flow of time becomes a mere phantasm of her imagination; seconds unwind into centuries and decades collapse into days. A Craft roll made with any Attribute as part of a superior or legendary project doesn’t count toward that project’s terminus. This Charm can only be used (Essence/3, rounded up) times on any single project. Warfare
