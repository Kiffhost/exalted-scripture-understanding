Once per battle, the Lawgiver may enact a signature stratagem that may not be counteracted by prophetic magic or [[Charms]] such as [[Battle-Visionaryâ€™s Foresight]]. This roll may be a unique strategy described by the player, or it may be one of the template strategies on page 212. In any case, the Strategic Maneuver roll is made with double 7s.
