*When the Dragon-Blood recalls a banished weapon with [[Elemental Sheath]], it’s wreathed with the element she summons it forth from (or her Aspect element, if she expends anima to summon it).*
Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood can use [[Elemental Sheath]] to reflexively shape and ready a mundane [[Melee]] weapon from an elemental manifestation, drawing the flames of a bonfire into a [[lance]] or shaping a sword from the razor-sharp edge of a biting gale. Either way, the weapon gains benefits based on the chosen element: 

### Air
Wind chills the weapon to a deadly cold. An enemy damaged by a decisive attack takes a −1 penalty on physical rolls until the end of his next turn. 
### Earth
Bulky stones reinforce the weapon, granting the Smashing tag. If it already has that tag, its smash attacks deal an additional die of damage. 
### Fire
Flames wreathe the weapon, granting +1 Overwhelming. 
### Water
The weapon is fluid and graceful, granting the Flexible and [[Grappling]] tags. If it already has at least one of those tags, add one bonus die on the attack roll of grapple gambits. 
### Wood
Vines or roots twine around the weapon, granting the Disarming tag. If it already has that tag, add one bonus die on the attack roll of disarm gambits.
