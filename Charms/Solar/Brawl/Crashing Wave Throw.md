The Solar concentrates her anima around the arc of a throw, hurling her opponent like a meteor to the ground. When the Exalt aborts control of a grapple to make a withering or decisive throw (see p. 201), the damage pool is boosted by +2 damage per round of control forfeited by the throw. The Exalt can throw her opponent up to short range. If she used Dragon Coil Technique to establish control of a clinch, she can hurl truly massive opponents across the battlefield. At Essence 3+, the Exalt may expend two or four rounds of control, decreasing the throw’s damage in order to increase its length, allowing her to throw a foe to medium or long range, forcing him to contend with short or medium distance falling damage— assuming she didn’t hurl him into an abyss, an empty well, an open cave mouth, or some other deep fissure.
