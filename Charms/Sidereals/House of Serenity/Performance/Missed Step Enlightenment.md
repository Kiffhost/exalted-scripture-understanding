*The Sidereal teaches others to take joy in failure, cherishing the lessons it has to offer.*
When the Sidereal observes a character fail a roll or suffer a setback, she can let him incur [[Experience Debt]] (p. XX) to purchase either (her Essence/2) dots of Attributes relevant to the failure or (her [[Charisma]]) dots of relevant Abilities. This can’t raise his ratings above the Sidereal’s own. The Sidereal’s target doesn’t need to actively train to gain this benefit; as he comes to terms with his failure emotionally, he realizes these talents, dividing the necessary training time by (Sidereal’s [[Essence]] + [[Charisma]]). With a [[Performance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a five-mote surcharge to use this as a Simple Charm, addressing up to ([[Essence]] x5) characters about a shared failure, setback, or difficulty that they’re currently facing or have recently faced. The number of dots each character may purchase is halved, rounded up, unless the Sidereal limits her audience to only ([[Essence]]) characters.
