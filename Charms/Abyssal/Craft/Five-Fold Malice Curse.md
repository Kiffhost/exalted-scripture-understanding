*Death’s Lawgiver weaves deathly curses into her works; woe betide those who receive her gifts.*
When the Abyssal completes a major or greater project, she can curse her creation. She chooses a trigger for the curse from the list below:
 - Upon giving the cursed object to someone, she can give them either a duty or a prohibition related to that object or the terms of that deal. It can’t be greater than a serious task. If the target fails to perform the duty or violates the prohibition, willfully or otherwise, the curse falls upon him.
 - The Abyssal may choose one of her own Major or Defining Intimacies. She can’t choose a positive Tie to the living, except for her Lunar mate. The curse is triggered if the object’s bearer acts in a way that opposes that [[Intimacy]].
 - The Abyssal may have the curse trigger when the object’s bearer does anything intended to harm or inconvenience her.
Once per scene, when the trigger condition is met, the curse falls upon the target. The Abyssal rolls (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) dice, as if undergoing Bleak Expiation (p. XX), using her successes to inflict Blights or [[Stigmata]] on the curse’s victim. She adds an automatic success if it required a superior project, or two successes for a legendary project, It doesn’t trigger if the target doesn’t have the cursed object on his person, or if he’s outside a cursed structure.
This Charm can be stacked to curse up to (Abyssal’s [[Essence]]) creations.
With [[Essence]] 3, the Abyssal may pay two white points to make a curse permanent. It no longer requires a mote commitment and doesn’t count against her maximum number of cursed creations.
