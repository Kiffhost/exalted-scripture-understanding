Abyssal Exalted are both [[CREATURES OF DARKNESS|creatures of darkness]] and [[enemies of fate]].
# Life in Death 
The Abyssal Exalted have not died, yet death is their very Essence. They’re considered undead only when this is beneficial for them. Both living and lifeless, they don’t receive the usual benefits of undeath.
# Death’s Chivalry 
Obeying death’s chivalry brings an Abyssal into a dark harmony with her Exaltation, calming her troubled soul. When she faces great hardships or making significant sacrifices to fulfill death’s chivalry, she gains one Willpower and rolls one die, losing Limit equal to her successes. 
When an Abyssal accomplishes a major character or story goal that upholds death’s chivalry, her temporary Willpower rises to equal to her permanent Willpower if it’s not already higher. She rolls (higher of Essence or 3) dice, losing Limit equal to her successes.
# The Trappings of Death
Outside of the Underworld and the shadowlands, deathknights suffer a −2 penalty on all rolls unless wearing the trappings of death or dwelling within a place associated with death, like a graveyard or Abys. The difficulty of noticing the trappings can’t exceed 5 — anything subtler than that is insufficient to provide this benefit
# [[The Solar Bond|The Lunar Bond]]
In the [[First Age]], many Solars and Lunars forged bonds between their very souls, ties that would persist beyond their death through every reincarnation. Even the Deathlords’ power could not taint this bond. When an Abyssal first encounters her Lunar mate, she usually experiences a flash of recognition. She may not understand what the bond she feels it, but its presence is unmistakable. 
She forms a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward him — typically a negative Tie at first. A player who wants to guarantee her Solar mate will be a prominent and positive figure in her Abyssal’s life should the Allies Merit. Otherwise, her mate’s appearances and role are up to the [[Storyteller]] — he could be an enemy, friend, rival, lover, or more. Note that not all Abyssals have Lunar mates.
# Martial Arts
Abyssals have Mastery with Martial Arts (Exalted, p. 427). They can learn Sidereal Martial Arts under under the tutelage of a Sidereal — or through battle against one.
# Necromancy and Sorcery
Abyssals can initiate into Void Circle necromancy (p. XX), but only Celestial Circle sorcery.
# Evocations
Abyssals are resonant with soulsteel and certain exotic substances of the Underworld, and neutral with all other materials.
