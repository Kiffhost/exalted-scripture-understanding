*The Infernal’s weapon dissolves into silver sand as it strikes an obstruction, only to reform on the side.*

The Infernal makes a withering or decisive attack that ignores cover, dissolving into silver sand and reforming on the other side. She can pay a two-mote surcharge to attack through full cover, but her 1s and 2s on the attack roll subtract successes.
## [[Keys]]
#### Least Flaw Exploited (Thrown 5)
The surcharge to attack through full cover is waived on unexpected attacks, attacks that benefit from aiming, and attacks against crashed enemies.
#### Eye of the Sandstorm (Thrown 5, Essence 3)
When the Infernal pays the surcharge to attack through full cover, she briefly sees any enemies behind that cover before she attacks, as if solid stone walls were shifting sand. 2s don’t subtract successes from her roll.
#### Mountains-to-Dunes Persistence (Thrown 5, Essence 3) (2i)
Once per scene, the Infernal can pay an additional two Initiative when she pays the surcharge to attack through full cover, letting her weapon pass through weapons and armor. The attack is unblockable and halves its target’s soak and Hardness, rounded down, except for any granted by magic. She can reset this key by landing a decisive attack that resets her Initiative and then crashing an enemy.
