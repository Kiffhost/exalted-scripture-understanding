*The sorcerer has studied the Book of Three Circles, and its eerie knowledge has taken root in her.*
Once per story, she may cast a sorcery spell she doesn’t know, although she must still meet its prerequisites. Thereafter, she may learn that spell without a mentor or source. The Storyteller may deem some spells aren’t contained in the book, primarily those newly invented by Second Age sorcerers.
