Diving below the shallows of her conscious mind into the depths of her deepest self, the Dragon-Blood submerges herself in a life of falsehoods. After spending at least an hour in meditation, she may rewrite her own memories of a single event or relationship. She could convince herself that a beloved spouse died in battle, erase an incriminating meeting with a co-conspirator from her memory, or make herself believe that she’s defected from her Great House to loyally serve a group that she’s actually infiltrating. She gains a Major [[Intimacy|Principle]] reflecting this belief, and may treat any influence that would weaken it as unacceptable for this Charm’s duration. She may release her mote commitment to this Charm reflexively to end its duration and restore her true memories, even if she doesn’t remember using it, but the [[Intimacy]] remains in place until she erodes it normally, until which time she may confuse her two sets of memories. At [[Essence]] 5, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Water Aura to use this Charm reflexively in response to any effect opposing her [[Guile]], altering her memories so that even if the effect succeeds, the information gleaned will be falsified. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) that the Exalt has altered her memories to achieve.
