Mercury’s golden light illuminates the Sidereal’s path, empowering her to overcome any obstacle. The Sidereal’s mount can move across surfaces that couldn’t normally bear its weight and can move up vertical surfaces or upside-down on ceilings. It can even move across thin air, though it can’t ascend or descend horizontally without a surface to move on. If the Sidereal ends her movement somewhere her mount couldn’t normally stand and doesn’t use this Charm on her next turn, they fall as usual.
