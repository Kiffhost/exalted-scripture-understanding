*The keen nose of the Iron Wolf seeks out those who would attempt to hide.*
Before an [[Awareness]] roll to detect unseen characters, the Solar’s nose automatically counts heads, telling her how many people are in the room, or are within medium range of her. If any scents belong to a person in her scent library, she automatically identifies him. For any unknown, she can further make generally accurate discernments about what kind of being each scent belongs to. Beasts, for example, smell different than humans, as do the undead and spirits. If a scent is not in her library, she can still form a general idea about the creature it belongs to. At this point, the player can choose to pay two motes to enhance the Lawgiver’s sense of smell, aiding her in scenting the direction and distance of each target. This adds one automatic success to an [[Awareness]] roll to uncover hidden targets, and to [[Join Battle]] if necessary. At [[Awareness]] 5+, [[Essence]] 3+, the Solar can detect dematerialized spirits with this Charm.
