The Exalt’s radiance blinds foes to her sword-sibling’s blade. This Evocation supplements a distract gambit. If successful, when the sword-sibling uses the transferred [[Initiative]], his attack is a surprise attack, inflicting a −2 penalty on the target’s [[Defense]]. 

## Resonant

If the target of the distract gambit is in [[Initiative]] Crash and doesn’t recover before the wielder’s sword-sibling attacks, it becomes an ambush (Exalted, p. 203).
