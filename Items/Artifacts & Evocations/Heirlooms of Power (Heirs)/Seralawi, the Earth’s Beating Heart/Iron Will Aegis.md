Seralawi draws from its master’s will, becoming as unbreakable as her spirit. After a withering attack roll hits the wearer, she may activate this Evocation to add (Willpower/2, rounded up) armored soak. If this reduces the attack to its minimum damage, she gains one [[Initiative]].
If the wearer uses [[Kinetic Armor Reinforcement]] after this Evocation, she can penalize the damage roll for its 2s as well as its 1s.
An [[Essence]] 2 repurchase of this Evocation extends its duration to last until the wearer’s next turn.
