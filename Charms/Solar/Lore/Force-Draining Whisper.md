*The Solar’s knowledge of the world’s secrets allows her to gainsay any force that would strike her down.*
As she is struck with a decisive attack, the Solar glances into the underpinnings of the universe, and utters a cipher she sees there. Roll the Exalt’s ([[Wits]] + [[Lore]]). Each success removes a single die of damage from the attack and converts it to a point of [[Initiative]] granted to the Lawgiver. Solars have been seen to walk unharmed through direct hits from offensive [[Templates/sorcery]] through use of this Charm. [[Force-Draining Whisper]] may be used once per scene, but is reset if the Solar or any of her allies reaches their last undamaged health level. At [[Essence]] 4+, the Solar may use this Charm to protect an ally at up to long range.
