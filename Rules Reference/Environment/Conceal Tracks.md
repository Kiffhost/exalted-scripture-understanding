> 'Synthesising certain Lunar Charms, the rules for [[Tracking]] and [[Conceal Evidence]].

Should a character take the time to actively cover their tracks, they can roll ([[Wits]] + [[Survival]]) ahead of time, with the Storyteller making a note of how many successes they achieved. A character subsequently searching for their tracks will take this number of successes as their quarry's result on the [[Dice Rolls#Opposed roll|opposed]] [[Tracking]] roll.
Concealing tracks in this way may slow the quarry's travel at the Storyteller's discretion. Painstakingly erasing all evidence of a character's presence may be better handled using the rules for [[Conceal Evidence]] and [[Case Scene]], potentially using [[Survival]] in place of [[Investigation]] and/or [[Larceny]]. Similarly, laying false trails, feigning particular destinations, or hiding and sneaking past the pursuers may be better handled with the rules for [[Social Influence]] or [[Rules Reference/Combat/Stealth|Stealth]].
