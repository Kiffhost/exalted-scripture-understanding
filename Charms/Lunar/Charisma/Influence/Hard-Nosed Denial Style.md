*Arguing with boundless tenacity, the Lunar refuses to be gainsaid.*
When a character makes an influence roll targeting only her, she makes a special ([[Charisma]] + {Performance, [[Presence]], or Socialize}) instill roll opposing it instead of asserting [[Resolve]]. She converts [[Resolve]] bonuses, like those from [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] and [[Charms]], to automatic successes on the roll. The Lunar’s influence contests her opponent’s [[Resolve]] before comparing their opposed rolls. If his [[Resolve]] is beaten, he’s instilled with a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of respect toward her, and 1s on his roll subtract successes. Then, if the Lunar’s roll beat his, his influence fails. A [[Charisma]] 4, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a four-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use this Charm against influence with multiple targets. If she wins the opposed roll, the influence fails against her, while other targets add (Lunar’s extra successes/2, rounded up) [[Resolve]]. If multiple Lunars contest the same influence, only the highest [[Resolve]] bonus applies.
