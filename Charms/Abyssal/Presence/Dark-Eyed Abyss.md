*The Abyssal’s mere glance entraps onlookers, the endless void of eternity behind her gaze inescapably compelling.*
The Abyssal rerolls 6s until they cease to appear on an [[influence roll]] against a single character to seduce him or [[instill]] a [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards herself that’s based on desire. She need not speak, denying her target the [[Resolve]] bonus for her using body language. If successful, she adds ([[Essence]]) to her [[Guile]] against anything that would provide information about her attempt or the motive behind it for the rest of the scene.
With a [[Presence]] 4, [[Essence]] 2 repurchase, it becomes impossible for others to recognize that the Abyssal attempted this seduction.
