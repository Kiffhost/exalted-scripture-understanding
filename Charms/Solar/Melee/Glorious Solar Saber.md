*Honing her skill and focusing her will, the Exalt shapes her [[Essence]] into the form of a blade.*
This Charm creates a weapon with stats identical to a daiklave, described on page 595. The weapon is made of solidified [[Essence]] forged in all the colors of Solar anima, and glows like a torch. Even a darkly-colored weapon such as a violet blade with a swirling hilt the color of blue flame will exude a shining aura. For additional purchases, players may add custom [[Evocations]] to [[Glorious Solar Saber]]. Players should work with their Storyteller to create [[Evocations]] that fits the character’s personality or iconic anima manifestation. In addition, [[Glorious Solar Saber]] has the following power: Molten Sun Blade: For one mote, one willpower, the weapon becomes superheated and drips molten flame that burns whatever it touches. The Solar’s next attack will destroy any mortal blade or shield that attempts to parry it. While the effect is active, the Solar may use a blade or spearhead like a blowtorch, melting through stone walls or steel gates at a rate of two feet per turn. If Molten Sun Blade is used in combination with a clash attack against a battle group, and the clash succeeds, the Solar is seen to strike a burning arc around her position, cleaving through the weapons of foes on all sides. The battle group may not attack her again until it has succeeded at a [[rally]] action.
