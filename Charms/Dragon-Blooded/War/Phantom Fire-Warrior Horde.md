The Dragon-Blood draws on the subtler strengths of flame, overwhelming enemy forces with the appearance of superior force. Her anima banner disperses among the ranks of her soldiers, creating illusionary warriors of smoke to fill in any holes in their ranks. When she successfully rallies for numbers, she adds (Essence/2, rounded up) to the Magnitude restored. The Dragon-Blood also treats the results of her roll as a threaten action against all battle groups that see the fire-warriors come into existence. Battle groups whose Resolve is beaten will retreat from her army, moving away from it each turn until an enemy commander makes a successful command roll to give them other orders.
