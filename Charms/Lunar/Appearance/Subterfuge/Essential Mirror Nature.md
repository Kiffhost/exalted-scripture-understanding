*The Lunar vanishes into the halls of the [[Scarlet Dynasty]] and the demon-ridden bowels of Hell with equal ease.* 
Her Caste Mark and anima banner take on an appearance suitable to a different type of Exalt, though she can’t mimic effects like a Dragon-Blood’s anima flux. Her anima banner doesn’t reveal her [[Tell]] or [[moonsilver tattoos]] while disguised. Her iconic anima still displays her personalized imagery, but assumes an appearance suiting the type of Exalt she’s mimicking. Alternatively, the Lunar can manifest supernatural sensory displays, such as seeming to hover inches above the ground or smelling of sulfur, instead of mimicking another type of Exalt. Appropriately chosen displays add ([[Essence]]) non-Charm successes on rolls to disguise herself as a spirit, fae, or similar supernatural being. Magic like [[Burning Eye of the Deliverer]] (Exalted, p. 358) that automatically sees through magical disguises can’t contest this Charm, save for [[Eye of the Unconquered Sun]]. 
## Protean 

While in another Exalt’s shape, the Lunar waives this Charm’s cost if she mimics his anima banner, and its duration is extended indefinitely while she remains in his shape. At bonfire anima, she displays his iconic imagery. 
## Totemic 

A Lunar whose spirit shape mimics the appearance of a plant or animal may learn this as a [[Manipulation]] Charm, with [[One of the Herd]] and [[Shifting Silver Masquerade]] as its prerequisites.
