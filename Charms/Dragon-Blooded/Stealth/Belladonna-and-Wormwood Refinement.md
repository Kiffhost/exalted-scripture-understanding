The Dragon-Blood twists the toxic Essence of her venoms into a puissant deliriant, ensnaring foes within feverish hallucinations. When she uses Foe-Blinding Venom, she may pay a two-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to create a hallucinogenic venom. Such a poison doesn't deal damage.
Instead, a poisoned victim is subjected to hallucinations for the duration of the poison as a Psyche effect, adding (Manipulation) to the usual duration.
The Dragon-Blood chooses the form the hallucinations take when she uses this Charm, and must limit them to a single, relatively specific delusion. She might make her victim believe that his surroundings are on fire, that his beloved paramour is present begging for him to flee, or that his enemies are grotesque Wyld mutants, but not all three at once. While these hallucinations can change the way the victim perceives something, they can’t eliminate something from his perception entirely. Her victim’s belief in the hallucinations counts as a Major Intimacy for the poison’s duration. The hallucinations can’t physically interact with anything, although the Dragon-Blood can make social influence rolls through them, using her own dice pools and actions.
The penalty inflicted by the poison still increases to –4 on rolls opposing the Dragon-Blood’s Stealth, but it also does so if the hallucination’s nature complicates an action (e.g., a disengage through terrain the target believes is on fire), or if the Dragon-Blood exploits the hallucinations with a stunt (e.g., persuading him through a hallucinated friend).
