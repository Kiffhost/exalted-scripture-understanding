### Prerequisite: Lunar Exalt

This Merit depicts a Lunar who’s taken human shapes at character creation. Each dot can provide five human shapes with no significant social standing — a peasant farmer, bandit, dock worker, street urchin, etc. — or a single human shape whose social, economic, or political status is a valuable asset, e.g., a Dynast, [[Guild]] factor, clan elder, queen’s favored daughter, etc.
