Once, there was a maiden…
...who lived in a tomb, and the tomb was made in
her image.
Because she lived in a tomb, she became like the
dead.
She slept, and dreamed,
and sometimes, woke, and walked within the
confines of her tomb.
“Why do you move?” her own ghost asked. “Why
walk at all?”
“I am not trapped while yet I run,” said she.
