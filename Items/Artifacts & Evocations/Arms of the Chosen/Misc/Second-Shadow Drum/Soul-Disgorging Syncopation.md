*The Exalt’s driving, insistent rhythm rises to a crescendo that beckons the lower soul from a living body.*
She rolls ([[Manipulation]] + [[Performance]]) against the [[Resolve]] of a willing, restrained, or unconscious human within short range. On a failure, this roll can’t be retried that night. If successful, the target’s lower soul boils forth from his mouth as a hungry ghost (Exalted, p. 503). This hungry ghost obeys any command from the Exalt that neither conflicts with the target’s Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] nor prevents it from returning to the target before sunrise. Lacking the higher soul’s reasoning power, it remembers sensory data but not abstract ideas, limiting its ability to provide coherent information if interrogated. The target remains comatose until the hungry ghost returns. Mortals die if the hungry ghost is destroyed; more powerful characters such as Exalts and sorcerers instead suffer seven dice of [[Hardness]]-ignoring aggravated damage as their dispersed lower soul reforms within them.
