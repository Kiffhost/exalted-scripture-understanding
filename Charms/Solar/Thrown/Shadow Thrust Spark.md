*When executing [[Sharp Hand Feint]], the Exalt expels her anima with a burst of [[Essence]], causing it to strike her opponent’s weapon as it passes.*
The Solar can invoke this Charm when a distract gambit supplemented by the prerequisite succeeds, automatically disarming the opponent and throwing his weapon to short range, to a location dictated by the Solar’s player.
