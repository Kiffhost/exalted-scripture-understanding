*Bracing her limbs with the tenacity of the unliving, the deathknight tightens her grasp.*
When the Abyssal would lose rounds of clinch control from being attacked or damaged, she can prevent this by paying two motes per round of control she preserved. She can use this Charm after the attack and damage rolls.
