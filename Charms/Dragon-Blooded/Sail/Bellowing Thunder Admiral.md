*Barking orders over the din of hurricanes, the Dragon-Blood incites her sailors to courage and swift victory in battle.*
She adds (Essence/2, rounded up) successes on command actions targeting battle groups made up of sailors under her command. Such groups add (her Essence/2, rounded up) successes on [[Willpower]] rolls against rout and gain the [[Resolve]] bonus of [[Old Salt Spirit]] as long as theyâ€™re within medium range of her. 

## Special activation rules

If the Dragon-Blood wins [[Join Battle]] after taking a boarding action in naval combat (Exalted, p. 246), she may use this Charm reflexively.
