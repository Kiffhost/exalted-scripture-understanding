The ground trembles beneath the Immaculate’s blow as she drives her tetsubo or stomping foot into the ground. To use this Charm, the Immaculate must have Initiative 15+. She makes a single decisiveattack roll against all other charactersinshortrange,includingallies.Thisattackisunblockable, undodgeable, and can’t be clashed. Instead, each character in range must make a (Dexterity + Athletics) opposed roll against the Immaculate’s attack to maintain his balance.Acharacterwhofailsisknockedproneandsuffers (Strength)diceofbashingdamage,ignoringHardness.This doesn’t include the Immaculate’s Initiative or reset her to base. Battle groups with Might 0 fail the roll automatically. Enemies that take 3+ levels of damage are knocked back one range band with immense force, suffering damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232). In Earth Aura, after paying this Charm’s cost, the Immaculate may divide her total Initiative evenly among each hit enemy, rounded up, adding it on top of this Charm’s base damage of (Strength). Doing so resets her to base Initiative as long as at least one enemy is hit. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing a nontrivial foe while he’s prone.
