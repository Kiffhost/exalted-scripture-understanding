*The Sidereal need not choose between one arrow in her quiver and its brother, nor must she limit herself to a single tactic.*
The Sidereal makes a distract gambit that also includes the effects of a disarm gambit, unhorse gambit, or, at the Storyteller’s discretion, an appropriate custom or situational gambit. The gambit’s difficulty is 5.
