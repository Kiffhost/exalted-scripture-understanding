*Filled as she is with death’s own hunger, the deathknight savors the bloody meat of new languages.*
The Abyssal develops temporary fluency after only an hour of conversational exposure to a language. She waives Primeval Tongue Echo’s cost to communicate in that language.
After a week of intense practice or constant exposure to the language, the Abyssal develops heightened fluency, and no longer faces impediments for lacking a common language when communicating in that language.
After a season of linguistic immersion or consistent practice, the Abyssal permanently learns the language, retaining it even after this Charm ends.
