*The Infernal takes her rightful place in the saddle, set above the beasts and demons that answer to her reins.*

The Infernal adds two automatic successes on a Ride roll, or on a threaten roll made against an animal. Alternatively, she can add +2 non-Charm Resolve against an animal’s threaten roll, or any influence that would cause her to see an animal as her equal.
## [[Keys]]
#### Rampage-Sustaining Speed (Ride 3) (+1wp)
The Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one hour. If she renews this Charm at the end of its duration, she waives this Willpower surcharge.
#### Unfettered Beast Charge (Ride 3) (+3m)
The Infernal can pay a three-mote surcharge to increase the automatic successes added to (higher of Essence or 3), or increase the Resolve bonus to that amount. If she succeeds on a mounted rush, she gains two Initiative. If she uses this together with [[#Rampage-Sustaining Speed (Ride 3) (+1wp)|Rampage-Sustaining Speed]], her mount can carry her at incredible speed: she can cover a distance that would normally take an hour to cross in ten minutes, a distance that would take a day to cross in a handful of hours, or a distance that would take a week to cross in a day.
