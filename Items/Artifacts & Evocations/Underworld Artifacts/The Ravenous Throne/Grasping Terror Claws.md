*The Ravenous Throne pins its master’s foes in place with its many bony limbs.*
[[The Ravenous Throne]] makes a grapple gambit against an enemy within short range, instantly moving into close range with its target. It adds (master’s [[Ride]]) bonus dice to the attack and control rolls. As usual for mounts, only the throne suffers the penalties for grappling, and it must take a drag action to move.
## Resonant
[[The Ravenous Throne]] doubles 9s on its control roll.
