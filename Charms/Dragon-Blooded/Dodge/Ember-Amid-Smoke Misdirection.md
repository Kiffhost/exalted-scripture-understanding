Striking at smoke only leads one closer to the flame. The Dragon-Blood gains +1 [[Defense|Evasion]]. On a successful dodge, her attacker overextends, suffering ([[Essence]]) dice of unsoakable withering damage. She doesnâ€™t gain [[Initiative]] from this. With an [[Essence]] 4 repurchase, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Fire Aura after successfully dodging to gain all [[Initiative]] lost by her attacker.
