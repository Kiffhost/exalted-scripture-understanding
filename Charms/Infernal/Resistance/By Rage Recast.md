*Cosmic might and boundless fury twist the Infernal into a terrifying expression of majesty.*

Upon purchasing this Charm, the Infernal’s player chooses six points of mutations. These mutations manifest whenever the Infernal reaches bonfire anima, lasting until her anima falls to dim. This isn’t optional.

With Resistance 4, the Infernal may choose to retain these mutations after her anima reaches dim. If she does, she can’t shed them until she next reaches bonfire and recedes to dim.
### Blasphemy
The Infernal also manifests these mutations while in her [[Devil-Body]].
