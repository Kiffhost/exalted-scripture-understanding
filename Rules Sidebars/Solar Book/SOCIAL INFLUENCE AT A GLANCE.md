### [[SOCIAL INFLUENCE AT A GLANCE]] SOCIAL INFLUENCE IS ABOUT: 

- Discovering the Intimacies of others. 
- Protecting your own Intimacies from discovery. 
- Exploiting othersâ€™ Intimacies to persuade them. 
- Instilling others with new Intimacies to affect their feelings or beliefs.
- Strengthening or weakening the Intimacies others already hold. 

In short: The social influence system is all about discovering, building or weakening the beliefs or emotional connections of others in order to convince them to do what you want them to do.
