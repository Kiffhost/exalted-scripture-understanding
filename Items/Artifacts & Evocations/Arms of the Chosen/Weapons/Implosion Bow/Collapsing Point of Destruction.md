After a turn spent aiming, an implosion bow’s master can use this Evocation to fire on a point out to long range. She rolls a single unblockable decisive attack roll against all characters within short range of the impact point, both allies and enemies. Battle groups and trivial characters are automatically hit, regardless of their [[Defense]], on any result but a botch. Each character hit suffers base decisive damage equal to the attack’s threshold successes. Divide the attacker’s [[Initiative]] evenly among them to determine the total damage, rounding up. An enemy that takes any damage is knocked prone and dragged one range band towards the center of the vortex. An enemy that dodges the attack by 3 successes or fewer suffers a tactical disadvantage even though they’re able to avoid the blast, suffering ([[Essence]]) dice of unsoakable withering damage. The artillerist gains all [[Initiative]] reaped by this attack. As long as one enemy is hit, the attacker is reset to base [[Initiative]] (plus any gained by making this attack). The bodies of enemies incapacitated by an implosion bow’s blast are destroyed utterly, drawn into the collapsing vortex and disintegrating within, leaving behind only artifacts and other indestructible items. Scenery, mundane structures, and unattended objects within range are also drawn into the vortex, suffering [[uncountable damage]] (Exalted, p. 205), leaving behind difficult terrain. This Evocation can only be used once per scene unless reset by remaining in place without taking any movement actions for three consecutive rounds as the implosion bow recharges. If the attuned character suffers [[Initiative]] Crash, any built-up power is lost, and she must spend another three rounds motionless to reset this Evocation. After a scene in which this Evocation is used, the implosion bow must receive maintenance before it can be fired again. This is a difficulty 3 roll for a character using [[Craft]] (First Age Artifice), or difficulty 6 for a character using [[Craft]] (Artifacts). A failed roll cannot be retried until a full day has passed.
