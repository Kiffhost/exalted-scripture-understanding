*Moving like a ghost in the night, the Abyssal rider pursues her prey with the inevitability of death itself.*
The Abyssal ignores difficult terrain, environmental penalties, and similar penalties caused by external conditions on a mounted movement action. If she rides through a mundane environmental hazard without stopping, she and her mount are unaffected and donâ€™t need to roll.
