The Lunar storyteller’s words breathe wisdom into her audience. She teaches another character through a story — a folk tale, legend, recounting of a historical event, episode from her own life, etc. He gains up to (higher of Lunar’s [[Essence]] or 3) dots of Abilities, or up to (Lunar’s Essence/2, rounded up) dots of Attributes. If the Lunar learned the story in play or introduced it with a fact, and it directly relates to the raised trait, she can confer an additional dot. She can’t raise a character’s trait ratings above her own. The student doesn’t need to actively train to gain these benefits — as he reflects on the story, he gradually internalizes its wisdom, dividing the training time required by (Lunar’s [[Essence]] + [[Intelligence]]). Player characters incur [[Experience Debt]] for raising traits in this way; a given Storyteller character can only benefit from this Charm once per story. An [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a five-mote surcharge to benefit ([[Essence]]) students. Alternatively, she may benefit ([[Essence]] x 5) students, but the number of dots she can grant each of them is halved, rounded down.
