Air is the breath of Creation, all-encompassing and ever-present. It’s the subtlest of the elements, unseen and untouchable. It can be felt but never grasped. Yet those who overlook the air that surrounds them are fools. Its wrath may strike swiftly, the tempest and the thunderbolt, or it can kill slowly, the wind that scatters sands and the chill that leeches away heat.

Exalting as an Air Aspect often leads a Dragon-Blood to take on a new perspective. Her thoughts turn from mundane details to lofty thoughts, seeing Creation with a bird’s-eye view. She eschews conventional wisdom to pursue grand dreams and high-minded idealism, forsaking the obvious for the subtle and the inspired. Short-term goals become trivial and unimportant in her estimation, as she focuses on what her actions may accomplish in the long run.

The lofty idealism and boundless creativity of the Children of Mela inspires their endeavors. On the field of battle, Air Aspect generals are tactical geniuses and strategic masterminds. They’re as elegant as the breeze and as deadly as the thunderbolt in battle, but such is their subtlety that few have the opportunity to appreciate it. Amid society, they’re visionaries and schemers whose plans extend countless steps ahead of their rivals and untold years into the future. They have the greatest natural affinity for the spiritual world and sorcery of all Dragon-Blooded, cultivating wisdom and power in pursuit of greater enlightenment.

An Air Aspect doesn’t see her Sworn Kin as they are, but as they could be. Hers is the voice that inspires them to greatness, teaching them how they might improve on their flaws and showing them what their deeds might accomplish in the long run. They play much the same role within Dragon-Blooded societies, innovating solutions to the problems they face and devising plans for how they might become greater. Air Aspects blow the dust off of forgotten ideas, and sweep away long-held beliefs that no longer hold use.

# Aspect Markings

Air Aspects tend toward a bluish or whitish tinge to their skin, which is cool or cold to the touch. They can smell of fresh breezes, new-fallen snow, or the ozone scent of lightning. Some have eyes that crackle with lightning at moments of inspiration or strong emotion, or are surrounded by a mild breeze even amid perfect calm. 
# Anima Banner

The anima banners of the Azure Dragons shimmer with pale blue or white light, whirling like gusts of wind or rolling clouds. Some gleam like light reflecting from ice, while others are jagged and erratic like lightning. They may give off the sound of screaming wind, or roaring thunder may accompany them. Their iconic animas might depict air dragons, whirlwinds and cyclones, thunderclouds that flash with lightning, falling snow or hail, or winged animals. 
# Anima Effects

Air Aspects call on the wind to speed them and deflect harm, and draw power from their ideals (p. 154). 
- For five motes, the Air Aspect can use her reflexive move action to leap an entire range band vertically or horizontally without needing to roll, and suffers no falling damage for the rest of the round. At bonfire, this power is free. 
- For three motes, the Air Aspect may deflect projectiles with a gust of wind, imposing a −1 environmental penalty on all ranged attacks against her until her next turn.
- Once per day, when the Air Aspect takes a nonextended social or mental action to uphold a Principle, she adds (Intimacy) non-Charm bonus dice on the roll.

# Great Curse Manifestation

An Air Aspect’s Great Curse can lead her to react with excessive anger, frustration, or despair when the world fails to live up to her idealistic visions of it. She may become so caught up in her high-minded idealism that she ignores the consequences it has for others or the suffering that it causes, or hold such confidence in her intellect and vision that she’ll brook no insult without retribution, or take truly foolish risks not believing that she could be wrong.
