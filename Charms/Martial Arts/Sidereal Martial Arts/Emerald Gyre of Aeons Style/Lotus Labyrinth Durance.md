Revealing the endless coils of eternity, the stylist imprisons her foe in an endless succession of a single day. The stylist makes a gambit to impart a lesson unto an enemy, represented by an Intimacy of her choice. Its difficulty is her target’s (Essence + base Resolve), but it’s reduced by his onslaught penalty at the time she attacks. If successful, her enemy bears witness to the shape of eternity: in the time it takes him to blink, he relives the past day up until the moment of being struck, at which point he returns to the beginning of the day. If the enemy chooses to internalize the stylist’s lesson as a Defining Intimacy, he emerges from this unscathed. If he rejects it, the endless succession ends only when his will is broken, causing him to lose all Willpower and fall to Initiative 0. The stylist gains all Initiative he gains this way. Afterwards, his memories of the repeated day fade, preventing him from recalling specific details about it. Alternatively, this Charm can be used to train a student, letting him incur experience debt (p. XX) to learn a single Charm or spell whose prerequisites he meets or up to (stylist’s Essence) dots of social or Mental Attributes, Abilities, or specialties. This can’t confer Charms, spells, or specialties the stylist doesn’t know or raise his traits above the stylist’s own. She can teach Charms she’s chosen for Histories Yet Unwritten without needing to use it. Enlightenment: When using this Charm for training, the stylist’s student can learn Charms, spells, and specialties that she doesn’t know and raise his trait minimums above hers. In order to learn a spell, he must have been able to feasibly access a teacher or record of it within the repeated span of time.
