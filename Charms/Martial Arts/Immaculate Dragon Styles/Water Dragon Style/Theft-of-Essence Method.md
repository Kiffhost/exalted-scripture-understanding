Landing a telling blow, the martial artist redirects the flow of a foeâ€™s Essence. Upon crashing an enemy, the stylist steals (Essence + his wound penalty) of his motes, adding them to her own pool. She may choose whether to drain personal or peripheral motes, adding them to the same pool she steals from.
