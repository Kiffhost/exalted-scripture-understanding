The sorcerer suffuses the void between her skin and the surrounding air with [[Essence]], weaving a second skin of shining bronze, supple and flexible as silk but cold and impervious as any metal. The [[Invulnerable Skin of Bronze]] gives the sorcerer +6 natural soak and [[Hardness]] 6, while rendering her immune to poison delivered through contact. Her metal-armored limbs deal lethal damage and use the traits of medium weapons when she makes unarmed attacks. While her mobility is not normally impaired, she is considered to be wearing medium armor, which might deny her the use of certain [[Martial Arts]] styles or other effects. Her bronze skin is also heavy—she will sink in water or mud, and fragile surfaces won’t support her weight. In addition, characters with an [[Essence]] pool gain access to the following powers while this spell is active: 
- Brazen Aegis Rebuke (3m, 1wp; Reflexive; Instant; Counterattack, Decisive-only): Even hardened steel recoils from the [[Invulnerable Skin of Bronze]], ringing off its indestructible surface. After being hit with an attack in close combat, the sorcerer may use this power to counterattack with a disarm gambit. This counterattack is both unblockable and undodgeable. 
- Invincible God-Metal Flash (10m, 2a or 3a; Reflexive; Instant; Decisive-only): When even the [[Invulnerable Skin of Bronze]] cannot withstand the force of an enemy’s blows, the sorcerer may shed it in a burst of protective [[Essence]]. While her anima is at the burning or bonfire level, she may use Invincible God-Metal Flash to reduce the raw damage of a decisive attack by her ([[Essence]] + 5), discharging her anima through the spell. The skin of bronze shatters as it absorbs the attack, and the sorcerer cannot cast it again until its original duration has elapsed. Her anima is returned to the dim level. 
- Sorcerer’s Impervious Mantle (4m; Reflexive; Instant; Withering-only): The sorcerer’s [[Essence]] surges through her armored skin, reducing the minimum damage of a withering attack by one.
A sorcerer who knows [[Invulnerable Skin of Bronze]] as her control spell may add her [[Essence]] to the soak and [[Hardness]] bonus she receives as long as she is unarmored. Even without the spell, her skin takes on a faint bronze tint. She may also add her [[Essence]] to her soak when the spell is not in effect. 

# Distortion 
(Goal Number: 12)
Distorting the spell forces the sorcerer to feel the full weight of her metal skin bearing down on her, imposing a -4 mobility penalty for one scene. If her total mobility penalty exceeds (the higher of her [[Strength]] or [[Athletics]]), then she loses the ability to take reflexive move actions, and must take a miscellaneous action to cross a range band even under normal circumstances. Distortion also disables all three of the spell’s special powers.
