*Death and rot afflict the fruits of the dragon lines in the wielder’s wake.*
She rolls a gambit to destroy a hearthstone on an enemy’s person: difficulty 5 for lesser hearthstones and 8 for greater hearthstones. Success destroys the stone and breaks its bearer’s attunement to the demesne or manse. If the hearthstone originated from a demesne or manse the wielder has disrupted with [[Sever the Flow]], she adds ([[Essence]]) dice on the attack and [[Initiative]] rolls. 

## Resonant

Shattering a hearthstone socketed into a weapon also disarms that weapon.
