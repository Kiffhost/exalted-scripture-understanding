*When the Exalt successfully defends her motives or [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] through an application of [[Guile]], she may reflexively make a read intentions action against the initiate, and if she pierces his [[Guile]] she gains a point of temporary [[Willpower]].*
The Solar may only use this Charm to respond to actions she is aware of. The Solar may use this Charm against a character even if she has already failed to read his intentions in the scene. A repurchase of this Charm allows the Exalt to notice a read intentions action from a source she is unaware of, reflexively ignoring the -2 penalty and noticing the general direction from which the action is being made. She may even attempt to discern the motives of a character she cannot perceive—even one on another plane of existence— but will only pick up the surface emotions of a character she can’t actually see. An [[Essence]] 4+ repurchase allows the Solar to respond to a read intentions action with one of her own, even if the target pierces her [[Guile]].
