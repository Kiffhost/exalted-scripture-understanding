*If at first you kill the wrong person, try, try again!*

The Infernal can use this Charm after dealing 5+ decisive damage with an unexpected attack or incapacitating a non-trivial enemy. Ready for the next kill, she gains one Initiative at the start of each turn as long as she’s in concealment from at least one enemy.

Once the Infernal reaches Initiative 15+, she can pay five motes and one Willpower when she makes an unexpected decisive attack to make it an ambush. Doing so ends this Charm. This Charm ends prematurely if she makes a decisive attack without invoking this benefit or if she’s crashed.
## Reset
Once per scene. It doesn’t need to be reset if it ends without the Infernal invoking its decisive benefits.
## [[Keys]]
#### Practice Makes Perfect
This Charm’s once-per-scene limit doesn’t apply if it’s triggered by incapacitating an enemy.
#### Certain Kill Guarantee (Essence 5, [[#Practice Makes Perfect]])
The Infernal reduces the levels of damage needed to trigger this Charm by (Essence/2, rounded up), minimum one.
