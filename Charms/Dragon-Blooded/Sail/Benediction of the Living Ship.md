*Verdant [[Essence]] races across the Dragon-Blood’s ship, reawakening the sylvan vitality of its timbers.*
Roots and branches knit together damaged portions of hull; flowers or fruit sprout to nourish the ship’s crew. She rolls ([[Essence]]), plus any applicable [[Sail]] specialty, and heals her ship of that many points of [[Hull]] damage. The Exalt and all allied characters aboard the ship heal a single level of non-aggravated damage as they bask in the fragrant aroma of blossoming flowers or eat of the ship’s bounty. If the ship’s food stores are running low, this Charm provides enough food to sustain the crew for the rest of the story. All members of the crew gain a non-Charm bonus success on any roll to resist poison or disease that they make while aboard the ship. This Charm can only be used on a ship once per story, unless all [[Hull]] damage to it is fully repaired.
