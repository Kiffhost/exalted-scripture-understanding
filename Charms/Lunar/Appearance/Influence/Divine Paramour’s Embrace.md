*Those who have a place in the Lunar’s heart are empowered by it.*
When she rolls to seduce a single target, he may opt not to resist, letting her succeed automatically. If he does, he’s comforted and affirmed  by the Lunar’s affections; following at least a minute of physical [[intimacy]], the Lunar may transfer up to (his positive [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her + 1) [[Willpower]] to him. Once per story, when the Lunar’s Solar mate benefits from this Charm, he loses one [[Limit]]. 

An [[Appearance]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase lets the Lunar transfer [[Willpower]] instantly, without requiring physical [[intimacy]] — her affectionate words embolden her beloved.
