Be as a spreading blaze, always advancing towards the fuel of your enemies. Upon incapacitating a nontrivial foe, the stylist may reflexively rush another enemy, doubling 9s. This doesn’t count as her movement action for the round. When rushing a creature of darkness, every 1 on his opposed roll grants the stylist one Initiative. 
## Mastery

On a successful rush, the stylist may instantly move into close range with her target in place of the normal effects of a rush and reflexively make a decisive attack against him, which doesn’t count as her attack for the round. If she incapacitates that foe, she may trigger this Charm again to make another rush.
