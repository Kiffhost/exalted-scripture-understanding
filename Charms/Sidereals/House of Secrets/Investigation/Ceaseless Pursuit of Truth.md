*Loving the world, loved by the world, the Sidereal stands at the nexus of all knowledge.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm when she discovers a clue that relates to one of her Defining Intimacies. She can also use it with a Major Principle based on compassion or a positive Major Tie that’s very broad in scope, like love for animals or sympathy for outcasts.
The Sidereal gains the following benefits while investigating to follow up on that clue and wherever it may lead
- Once per scene, she can add a free full Excellency on an Awareness, Investigation, or Lore roll to search for or produce relevant information.
- Once per scene, she can waive the Willpower cost of an Awareness, Investigation, or Lore Charm used to obtain relevant information. This doesn’t apply to Charms with a duration longer than one scene.
- She treats social influence that would dissuade her from the investigation as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). Once she concludes her investigation and decides what course of action is called for, any influence to deter her from that choice is likewise unacceptable.
- When using Witness Invention Technique, she halves the intuition point costs of its effects, rounded down.
- When using Lucid Enigma Labyrinth, if she chooses a course of action proposed by the Intimacy she used this Charm through, she can choose a second Intimacy’s proposal to also gain that Charm’s benefit.
Successfully concluding the investigation counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. 132). If she abandons the investigation or changing circumstances render it impossible or irrelevant, she loses one Willpower and one Limit.
The same applies if she ends this Charm prematurely.
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by successfully concluding the investigation that upholds a Major or Defining Principle of compassion or a positive Major or Defining Tie with a broad scope.
