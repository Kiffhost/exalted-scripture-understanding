*Even the most innocuous of objects are deadly in the Abyssal’s hands.*
The Abyssal waives the [[Initiative]] cost of attack with improvised weapons, and can wield small objects as improvised weapons even if they’re unsuited to that purpose: a playing card, a plucked rose, a silken scarf.
If the first attack the Abyssal makes in a scene uses an improvised weapon, she may pay two motes to make a surprise attack, inflicting −2 [[Defense]] against it.
