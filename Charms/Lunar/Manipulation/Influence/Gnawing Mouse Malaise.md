The Lunar poisons armies and ministries from within, sowing chaos and turmoil. She spends a scene interfering with an organization she (or whoever she appears to be) holds a position of authority within — giving subordinates contradictory instructions, misappropriating funds, spreading rumors about other organization members, destroying records, etc. She rolls (Manipulation + [Bureaucracy, Larceny, or Socialize]) with (Essence) automatic successes, opposed by the highest appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll of any involved group member. A generalmightroll(Intelligence+War)againstanattempt to disrupt his supply lines; a devious bureaucrat might roll (Manipulation + Bureaucracy) to counter the Lunar’s efforts with his own schemes; a crime boss might roll (Charisma + Larceny) to retain his syndicate’s loyalty; etc. Success inflicts internal turmoil, mismanagement, and delay. 1s on group members’ rolls subtract successes on rolls to carry out the organization’s official business — a Bureaucracy roll to allocate a ministry’s resources and manpower, an Investigation roll to sniff out corruption within a business, a general’s Strategic Maneuver roll to position an army, etc. — and the time necessary to complete such actions (or the interval of extended actions) is doubled.Whenarollpenalizedinthiswayfails,theLunar gains one Willpower, maximum one per day. She gains +3 Guile against effects that would reveal her culpability. An organization member can undo this sabotage by successfully uncovering the Lunar as its culprit and completing a project (Exalted, p. 226) to undo or reform whatever harm she caused. Alternatively, magic such as Woe-Capturing Web can oppose this Charm. This Charm can only be used on a given organization once per story.
