Cut and shaped from the living brass of Hrotsvitha, Brazen Harvest exudes the seething, constant fecundity of the hungry woods. It is an enormous, bulbous mace, and its surface is covered with nodules and polyps that slowly form, split, and reform themselves endlessly while Brazen Harvest is quiescent.

When attuned, Brazen Harvest gives birth to a riot of unseemly growth around it. Simple earth becomes squirming mats of fibrous grass; carved stone sprouts translucent leaves of lithic growth that thicken into veinous stony shrubs; metal plates offer up teaming stalks of glittering fractal plants. In Malfeas, its unchecked use can create entire microclimes as it arouses the Demon City’s materials into a localized frenzy, turning alleyways or oubliettes into pockets of festering inanimate life. In Creation, such use can lead to places where plant and animal life is driven out or smothered. Any that remain become carbon fodder for successive spawning inorganic growth.

A driven adherent to the forest’s voracious hunger, Brazen Harvest’s unknown creator fed ever greater wealth, treasures, and still-living victims to Hrotsvitha’s heart in acts of ecstatic worship, hoping to one day spread its obscene creed across Malfeas and beyond. Instead, the creator’s name was consumed along with their life in a final orgy of consumption, leaving behind only the blood-slick weapon, which was born away by the creator’s last near-victims. In Malfeas, it has been wielded as a battle standard by demon legions, an artist’s tool by the neomah Suxi the Crucible, and even a gourmand’s utensil by the insatiable Seven-Tongued Saint.
## [[Evocations]] of [[Brazen Harvest]]
While attuned, Brazen Harvest causes strange growths to proliferate from inanimate materials within close range of it. Most materials spawn plantlike growths of their own substance. The magical materials produce growths of their base metal instead: gold from orichalcum, silver from moonsilver, iron from starmetal, and jadeite from jade; soulsteel produces nothing but moans. Bone, wood, and other formerly living matter produces hairlike vines of carbon, sticky with unctuous liquids, that grow in ever more complicated tangles. Its wielder can quiet this effect for a scene simply by willing it.

Harvesting materials created by Brazen Harvest provides small quantities of the parent substance. A day spent collecting materials provides enough to make a Resources • purchase, or a Resources •• purchase for particularly valuable seed materials, like silver or firedust.
