The Sidereal fixates on a calamity she believes will befall her and those who matter to her unless they abandon an agenda, plan, perspective, or location. She’ll persuade others to do so if she can and force them if she can’t, though she can refrain from causing physical harm to those for whom she has positive Ties. If she encounters a danger she believes is related to this calamity, she’ll flee or avoid it; she can’t confront it directly unless she has no other options.
Even if the Sidereal successfully convinces others to leave behind what she warned against, her dread doesn’t abate. A new calamity will inevitably loom on the horizon, and something else must be abandoned to avert it.
This ends if the Sidereal is forced to confront a significant danger she believes is related to the calamity and succeeds.
