The Exalt’s steed scatters fires across its trail. This Evocation supplements a move, rush, or disengage action, leaving a trail of flames as an environmental hazard with Difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round that lasts for (Essence) rounds. Used with a disengage action, the flames impose a −(Essence) penalty on enemy rolls to contest that action, and anyone contesting the action immediately suffers the effects of the hazard. When the rider supplements a disengage action with the four-mote version of Coursing Firebolt Flash (Exalted, p. 382), anyone contesting her disengage action suffers the same effects as they would from this Evocation. 

## Resonant

If the Exalt’s disengage action goes uncontested, all opponents within close range suffer the effects of the hazard.
