Even the most haggard of waterfowl might play the part of a regal swan, given proper grooming. The Sidereal can use [[Proper Plumage]] on another character after a scene spent having him try on outfits, giving fashion advice, tailoring his wardrobe, or buying clothes for him. Its bonus [[Appearance]] doesn’t stack with other bonus dots. With an appropriate [[Craft]], the Sideral gains ([[Essence]]) gold points when that character upholds a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] or accomplishes a major character story goal with this Charm’s help. The Sidereal can use [[Proper Plumage]] multiple times to benefit multiple characters.
