Sharp senses foil the plots of poisoners and track plagues back to their source.
When the Lunar successfully diagnoses a malady with [[Stricken Calf Sense]] or detects a harmful substance with [[Spider-Amid-Roses Discernment]], her player can ask the Storyteller one of the following questions about that malady or substance. Every three extra successes let her ask an additional question.
 - How could I identify its source?  - Where could I find something to help treat it?  - Has someone tried to conceal anything involving it?  - Are there any supernatural forces involved with it? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Lunar’s player should provide one, as if [[introducing a fact]].
