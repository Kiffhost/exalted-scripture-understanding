*The Sidereal sees the shape of perils to come.*
The Sidereal rolls ([[Perception]] + [[Awareness]]) against a difficulty of 1-5, varying with both the subtlety or deceptiveness of any threats present and the number of threats present, or against the highest difficulty to notice a hidden enemy or danger present in the scene if that’s higher. Success lets her player asks the Storyteller one of the following questions, plus an additional question for every 3 extra successes: 
- Who here is in the greatest danger? 
- What here poses the greatest danger to me? 
- What’s the safest place here? 
- What’s the best way to get out of here? If the Storyteller doesn’t have an answer in mind for a question, the Sidereal’s player should provide one, as if [[introducing a fact]].
