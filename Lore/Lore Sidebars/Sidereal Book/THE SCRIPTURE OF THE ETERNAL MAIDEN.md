Once, there was a maiden…
...made from a lump of iron, shaped by wind, sea, and fire.
Fearing how wood might shape her, she ran, and did not look back.
One day, she forgot what she ran from.
So she pulled out her heart to ask it.
“Why don’t you look back and see?” it said.
So, she sighed and threw her heart away.
“I have no use for beginnings,” said she.
