*The Exalt gazes into the [[Essence]] of the world and sees the patterns of magic that make up Creation.*
For a few seconds after activating this Charm, the Solar can see [[Essence]] flowing through the world. She can perceive immaterial spirits, but moreover, she can see the workings of spirit energies around her. If a character is using a shaping action or Evocation, the Solar may make an [[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]] roll at a difficulty of the effect’s [[Essence]] minimum to determine how the power works. This Charm may also be used to identify the presence of ongoing sorcerous effects such as mystical barriers and levitating platforms, revealing not only the presence of magic, but how it functions. This power also allows the Exalt to see places where Creation is thin—the borders of shadowlands and the Wyld appear as hazy, gauzy distortions of light. The Solar may also detect the entrance to spirit sanctums within her range of vision. This Charm does not reveal the working of the [[Charms]] of the Exalted.
