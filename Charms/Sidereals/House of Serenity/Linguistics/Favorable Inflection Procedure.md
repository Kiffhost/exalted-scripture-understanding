The Sidereal speaks someone’s name with an intonation that echoes the pattern of his fate, filling his heart with warmth, happiness, and a feeling of connection to her. Addressing someone by name or nickname — either verbally or in writing — the Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Linguistics). This counts as both a roll to instill a positive Tie toward the Sidereal and a roll to inspire happiness. The Sidereal is never perceived as the source of this effect. If the Sidereal uses this Charm on someone hostile to her or upset with her, he forgets the reason for that, losing his train of thought. Subsequent events may remind him of it, and he remembers it if he spends Willpower to resist both of this Charm’s influences. If the Sidereal has stolen a name with Name-Pilfering Practice (p. XX), she can use this Charm to plant it on another character, addressing him by that name. If she succeeds, she transfers it and its benefits to him, in addition to the above effects. Reset: This Charm can’t be used against a character more than once per scene.
