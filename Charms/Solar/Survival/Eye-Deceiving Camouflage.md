With this Charm, the Solar can camouflage herself or an object ([[Essence]] + 1) yards wide so perfectly that they cannot be detected by mundane senses while immobile. Even the acute senses of a claw strider or other famed hunting beasts will fail to detect the Exalt (or her shelter, or her hidden cache of food, etc). Preparing this camouflage takes the Solar an hour. The player rolls ([[Intelligence]] + [[Survival]]) and records the successes, rerolling all nonsuccesses a single time and all 1s until 1s fail to appear.
