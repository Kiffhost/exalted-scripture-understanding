The Dragon-Blood’s reputation precedes her ship to shore. She can manipulate the flow of her reputation as though it were a stream of water, choosing one of the following effects. Carousing: Adopting the poise of a sailor in port, the Dragon-Blood radiates a desire to take part in drinking, gambling, and similar vices common to sailors, as well as any local indulgences. Characters seeking to supply such vices will seek her out to provide them or information about where to get them. Heroism: The Dragon-Blood’s naval prowess marks her as a hero of the seas. Characters facing problems that a seafaring hero could solve, such as pirate raids, a loved one lost on a missing ship, or an urgent shipment of exotic goods that needs to be delivered, will seek her out as the solution to their problem, treating this as a Minor Tie of trust to her. Leadership: The Dragon-Blood radiates the confidence of a commanding admiral. All sailors under her command are treated as having a Minor Tie of respect towards her, and she adds one bonus success on inspire rolls and command actions targeting them. Trivial characters who are seafarers gain this Intimacy even if they aren’t part of the Exalt’s crew. Menacing: The Dragon-Blood’s bearing suggests ruthlessness and a history of violence. She adds one automatic success on threaten rolls and gains the Hideous Merit (Exalted, p. 162).
