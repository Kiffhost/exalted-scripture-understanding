Few concern themselves with what the Sidereal says, only the way she says it. As the Sidereal makes a single statement, she makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Socialize]]) roll against all who hear her, ignoring multiple target penalties. Affected characters consider the statement to be contextually appropriate and inoffensive. Simply by babbling nonsense, she could effortlessly navigate a foreign culture’s complex etiquette, give interrogators answers that exonerate her from suspicion, or give password to a guard. Characters who hear the statement repeated secondhand are likewise affected. Nontrivial characters may pay one [[Willpower]] to resist this influence. With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a one-mote, one [[Willpower]] surcharge to extend this Charm’s duration to one scene.
