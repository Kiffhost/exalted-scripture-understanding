*The Abyssal elevates a loyal killer to her honor guard of grim lieutenants, rewarding his service with a sign of her favor.*
The deathknight spends a scene commending a favored soldier, giving him a symbol or token of her favor: the insignia of his new rank, a ceremonial sword, one of the Company of Martial Sinners’ masks, etc. He must have a Tie from [[Loyal Unto Death]] at Defining intensity. So long as he keeps that Defining Tie and bears the Abyssal’s gift, he gains the following benefits:
 - +1 [[Resolve]]. This increases to +2 [[Resolve]] against fear-based influence or influence opposed by his Tie of loyalty.
 - Other characters with Ties to the Abyssal from [[Loyal Unto Death]] apply those Ties to him as well.
 - Once per day, he can add (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) successes on a [[War]] roll or threaten roll.
 - The Abyssal’s gift is nigh-indestructible, like an artifact.
The Abyssal can stack this Charm to promote up to ([[Essence]] x2) characters. Uses past the first cost one mote, one [[Willpower]].
With [[War]] 5, [[Essence]] 4, lieutenants favored with this Charm can act in the Abyssal’s stead for [[Acclaimed Company of Sinners]] and [[Hardened Killer Training Style]], letting her pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to use those [[Charms]] from afar when her lieutenants commend or train troops.
