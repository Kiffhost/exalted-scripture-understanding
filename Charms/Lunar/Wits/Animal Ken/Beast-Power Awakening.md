Entwining her soul with her familiar’s, the Lunar draws from its Essence. While within short range of her familiar, she rolls (Wits + [Presence, Ride, Survival, or War]) with (Essence) automatic successes, gaining motes equal to her successes. These motes can only be spent on Charms enhancing the familiar or on its magical abilities, and are lost at end of scene if not used. This Charm can only be used once per day.
