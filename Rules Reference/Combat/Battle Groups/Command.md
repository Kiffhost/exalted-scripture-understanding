[[Battle Group]]s are mostly self-contained and self-directed entities, under the Storyteller’s control—even battle groups allied with or “owned by” players’ characters. Sometimes, however, individual heroes wish to exercise more direct command over a battle group. This is done with command actions.

To issue a command action, a character must be either the recognized leader of a battle group—such as the boss of a gang or the commander of an army—or must be a known hero to the members of the group, whom they would be willing to trust and rally around in the midst of battle. 

A command action is a one of three different combat actions: Either an [[Order]], a [[Rally]], or a [[Rally for numbers]]. None can be placed in a [[Flurry]]. In order to direct command actions to a battle group, a character must have some way of making himself understood—shouting to subordinate officers from the front of battle, using signal relays from a back-line command post, and battlefield magic are the most common methods.
