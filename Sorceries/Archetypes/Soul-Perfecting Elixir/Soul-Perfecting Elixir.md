*Through study of the arts of alchemy and the bodily humors, you have brewed the [[Soul-Perfecting Elixir]], a draught that transformed your body into a living cauldron.*
Yours is a [[sorcery]] rooted in the corporal, sustained by the balance of vital forces and the flow of [[Essence]] along meridians. Through the consumption of alchemical catalysts and adherence to ascetic practices, you maintain your body as a pure vessel through which sorcerous forces may be channeled into the world.
