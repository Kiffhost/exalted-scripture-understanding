Through the use of this Charm, the Solar becomes able to survive in even the most hostile conditions without special preparation. This Charm negates all environmental penalties to Survival rolls and eliminates the deleterious effects of exposure to extreme climates. The coldest glacier and the hottest desert are no more deadly to the Solar than the gentlest rolling plain. She ignores inclement weather even when lightly dressed, and does not suffer undue blisters, bug bites or plant poison even when walking barefoot through the jungle. This Charm does not protect the Exalt against environmental damage. In addition, Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit lowers the difficulty to forage and find shelter by 2, to a minimum of 1.
