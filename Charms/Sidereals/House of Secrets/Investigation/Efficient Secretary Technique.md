Upon learning this Charm, the Sidereal spits up a small spider of living emerald, a jubilant assistant that skitters into the strands of her fate until she beckons it forth. The Sidereal’s spider emerges so that she may ask it a single factual question, to which it provides an accurate answer. It can’t answer questions involving speculation, matters of opinion, or subjective judgments, nor does it have any insight into supernatural powers or people’s thoughts, plans, and emotions. It also can’t reveal any information that anyone’s taken efforts to conceal, nor can it reveal information if it’s not known to anyone in existence. Examples of information the secretary can provide straightforwardly include the name of the local carpenter, how long ago a widow’s wife died, how many oxen an old friend owns, or the temperature of in Nexus. A question like “what’s the Bull of the North doing?” will typically give an accurate but not useful result, as the secretary can’t ascertain the Solar’s intentions or speculate as to the purpose of his current activities. Questions like “who’s winning this war?” or “which of these two men is more beautiful” are too speculative or subjective for the secretary to answer; it can only chitter its apologies. This Charm may be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation to the Sidereal’s secretary that can expand the range of its information gathering and talent as an assistant. These Evocations’ themes and functions derive from the secretary’s established personality, the Sidereal’s Caste, and the themes of the constellation of the Key and the Scripture of That Old Thing. If the Sidereal has a pattern spider familiar, she can also use these Evocations through it.
