Once, there was a maiden…
...falling forever in the water. She reached for
purchase, but found nothing; her arms swung
through the sea.
The water did not slow her, nor the chill,
but she could not breathe.
Each time she gasped and found no breath, a human child died, and thus, she lived.
“Survival is acceptance,” she said.
