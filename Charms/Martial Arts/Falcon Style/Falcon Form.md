*Spreading her arms wide in emulation of the falcon’s wingspan, the stylist enters a stance as nimble as it is formidable.*
She doubles 9s on grapple control rolls and adds (Athletics) to the rounds of control from which her throws and slams can benefit (Exalted, p. 201). She can use reflexive move actions to jump one range band straight up without rolling, and halves falling damage, rounded down. She gains +1 Defense against non-ranged attacks from enemies at lower elevation, unless they have the Reaching tag. 
## Special activation rules
When the stylist succeeds on an opposed movement roll or a grapple control roll with 5+ successes, she may reflexively enter Falcon Form.
