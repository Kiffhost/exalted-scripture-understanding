*The Infernal sunders the battlefield from the world, swallowing friend and foe alike within her own personal Hell.*

A ring of emerald fire encircles the battlefield, forming a barrier at long range from the Infernal. It’s an environmental hazard with difficulty 4, Damage 5L/round and counts as difficult terrain. It fades away if the Infernal is crashed or incapacitated, ending this Charm prematurely.

At the start of the Infernal’s next turn, everything within the ring of hellfire is cut away from that realm of existence and enfolded within a cyst-like manifestation of the Demon City, altering the battlefield’s terrain and scenery to match. If she has [[Spirit of the Living World]], she can create a prison-realm that draws from her inner realm.

The prison-world provides the following effects:
- The Infernal automatically enacts a Fortifications stratagem. The difficult terrain penalty applies on enemies’ Stealth rolls and rolls to take cover or rise prone.
- The Infernal gains [[City-Flesh Teratoma]]’s benefits for the entire battlefield.
- The Infernal and allied battle groups always count as having at least light cover, which provides sufficient coverage for them to enter concealment with Stealth rolls.

The battlefield’s original location is filled with silver sand until it returns at the end of this Charm’s duration. Characters can escape back into the sands by successfully withdrawing from combat (Exalted, p. 199). Characters outside the prison-realm can use magic like [[Shattered Gates of Heaven]] (p. XX) to enter it through the sands.

This Charm ends if the Infernal is incapacitated, returning the prison-realm.
