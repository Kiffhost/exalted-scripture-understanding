Much like hazards described on page 387, storms represent a major source of damage to ships. Storms can snap masts and oars, capsize ships or smash them beneath vast swells. While this Charm is active, the Solar can protect a ship no larger than a trireme, adding ([[Essence]]) automatic successes to each [[Sail]] roll to evade storm damage.
