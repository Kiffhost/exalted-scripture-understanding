There was once an enlightened city that sat alone on the shores of Creation. It was raised and ruled by a Solar of the Twilight, whose brilliance and prowess was seen as a threat. Though she fought valiantly to defend her paradise, she failed. A lone survivor amid the broken towers of her shattered kingdom, Za’Rei stood beneath the shattered skylight of her temple workshop and lifted her eyes to see the dust of her ruined creations suspended in a sunbeam. Never again, she vowed. She summoned forth a majestic dragon from the Pole of Fire. In its blazing suspiration, she forged a suit of orichalcum plate fashioned after her own iconic banner, the chest-plate resembling a stylized lantern, each smaller plate bearing the abstract semblance of flickering flames. This armor can absorb the very substance of an Exalted anima and use it to shield its wearer from deadly force. Once thus infused, it can channel that natural brilliance into a bold, bright challenge to all comers, empowering the Exalt to stand as an unyielding sentinel between the enemy and the innocent. Brilliant Sentinel possesses two hearthstone sockets, one just below the throat, the other on its back, between the user’s shoulder blades. 

## Evocations of the Brilliant Sentinel 

When attuned and worn, the armor imposes a -1 penalty to the Join Battle rolls of all enemies who have harmed or wish to harm the object of one of the wearer’s Major or Defining Intimacies. This penalty becomes -1 success to all unExalted creatures of darkness.
