*The Lawgiver’s resolve is steeled by a life spent on the deck of a ship, rocked to sleep by the hand of death.*
This Charm permanently enhances the Exalt’s Willpower. So long as she started the day by waking up shipboard, on the water, she may ignore the Willpower cost to resist one instance of social influence per day. 
Note that this power is discretionary: the Exalt may always allow herself to be persuaded by mental influence, so that the player can husband this Charm’s potential against more dangerous persuasion.
