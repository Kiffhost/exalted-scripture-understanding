The Dragon-Blood darts forward with an explosive burst of speed to pursue her foes. She rolls an additional non-Charm die on a rush for every 1 that appears in the rushed characterâ€™s opposing roll. With Athletics 5, Essence 3, the Dragon-Blood may expend her Fire Aura when she reflexively moves to pursue an enemy after successfully rushing him with this Charm to ignite a fiery trail behind her, an environmental hazard with difficulty 3 and Damage (Essence/2, rounded up)L/round. It burns until the end of the round unless the Dragon-Blood crossed over a flammable surface such as a wooden floor or grass, which ignites until extinguished or end of scene.
