Once, there was a doll…
...who sat on a child’s shelf and watched the entire
world.
Her eyes were made of glass,
and their pupils were red.
Her mouth was sewn on.
For years and years, she did not move.
Then, when necessary, she was gone, and the
head of that child with her.
“Survival is control,” she said.
