*Having claimed a delicious morsel, the rat scurries away to enjoy it.*
The stylist can use this Charm after dealing 2+ levels of damage with a decisive attack, letting her forgo one level of damage to reflexively disengage from her target. She doesn’t lose [[Initiative]] for doing so. It doesn’t count as her movement action.
## Special activation rules
With [[Essence]] 3, the stylist can use [[Scurrying Rat Retreat]] reflexively with this Charm to reflexively flurry the disengage roll with a [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]] roll to enter concealment.
## Mastery
The stylist doesn’t need to forgo damage.
## Terrestrial
The stylist doesn’t gain the [[Essence]] 3 effect.
