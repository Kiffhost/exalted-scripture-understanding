*The martial artist has studied the eight secret motions for weaving the Loom that Asna Firstborn taught her teeming young; through them, she reweaves her enemies’ fates.*
The stylist makes a gambit against a crashed enemy. Its difficulty is (victim’s [[Essence]] + [[Resolve]], minimum 6). Success lets her inflict one of the following transformations:
By default, these transformations are permanent, persisting until undone by magic like [[Order-Affirming Blow]] (Exalted, p. 334). The stylist may choose to set a limited duration for it as well as one or more conditional triggers her victim can satisfy to end the transformation. [[Charms]] that let a character protect themselves from poison, like [[Immunity to Everything Technique]] (Exalted, p. 379), can be used against [[Pattern Spider Touch]]. However, magic that treats poison can’t undo these transformations. 
### Another Life Venom
The stylist transforms her target into a human of any appearance, though not a duplicate of an existing individual. She can alternatively give him the appearance of a god, demon, elemental, ghost, or other supernatural creature, though this doesn’t grant any actual power beyond cosmetic supernatural displays. The stylist’s player may briefly describe a backstory and social role for this new person — “a coal-hauler in the city’s industrial district,” “a notorious local gossip,” “god of this cairn.” 
The stylist’s will shapes reality through subtle manipulations of probability and alterations to the memories of trivial characters to bring the victim into that role or the nearest feasible equivalent. His memories are suppressed and replaced by constructed memories suitable to his role and backstory that will hold up to at least modest scrutiny. His [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] are unchanged, though he may not be able to understand them immediately. If the victim finds evidence his memories have been compromised, he can pay one [[Willpower]] to either regain his memory of one scene or regain all memories associated with one of his [[Intimacy|Intimacies]]. Once he’s spent a total of (stylist’s [[Essence]]) [[Willpower]] this way, his memories are restored in full.
### Inner Beast Awakening Venom
The stylist transforms her victim into an animal. His actions use the lower of his or the animal’s dice pool (3 dice if it has no listed pool). He also uses its Evasion, Parry, and natural soak if they’re worse than his own. He can attack with his animal form’s natural weapons and make use of its non-latent special abilities and [[Merits]], subject to the above restriction, but any dice added are Charm dice. His consciousness and intellect become typical for that animal. 
His memories and [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] are unaltered, but he typically loses his understanding of language and his capacity for higher reasoning may be diminished, among other potential effects. He can pay one [[Willpower]] to restore his mind for one scene; once he’s spent a total of (stylist’s [[Essence]]) [[Willpower]] this way, it’s restored for the remainder of his transformation. 
### People-as-Things Venom
The stylist transforms her victim into an object or other inanimate natural phenomena with roughly the same mass as her victim. A victim typically becomes an object that typically has a similar appearance in some way: a statute, an oak tree that resembles him from a certain perspective, an empty suit of armor, etc. Victims remain conscious and aware of their surroundings but are typically unable to act. Exalted and other puissant beings may find ways to take actions as objects with stunts or clever use of [[Charms]], facing penalties appropriate to their form. If the object is destroyed, the victim lapses into a coma-like state, but can potentially be brought back if it’s repaired.
## Reset 
This Charm can only be used once per story unless reset by devouring the soul of an Exalt or [[Essence]] 6+ being with [[Maw of Dripping Venom]]. It can’t be reset by the [[Dawn]] Caste anima or similar effects. If the stylist fails to transform her Charm, it doesn’t need to be reset, though she can’t use it again for the rest of the scene.
