*Death opens the Abyssal’s senses to drink in the richness of the world she must slay.*
Upon learning this Charm, the Abyssal’s player chooses one of the following sets of senses: sight, hearing and touch, or smell and taste. While using this Charm, the Abyssal gains the following benefits with the chosen senses
- She adds two dice on (Perception + Awareness) rolls using an enhanced sense, or two successes on unopposed rolls. The Storyteller is encouraged to give her wide leeway in stunting incredible feats, albeit potentially at high difficulties:
counting a mass of soldiers at a glance, hearing at frequencies below human range, “reading” a tapestry by touch alone.
- She increases the range at which she can make out small details with the enhanced sense: 300 feet for vision or hearing, or (Essence x600) feet for scent. This range is increased for larger details at the Storyteller’s discretion.
- She ignores up to one point of penalty on rolls with any Ability caused by external conditions that impede the enhanced sense, aiding in feats like seeing in total darkness, listening through stone walls, or scenting old trails.
- With a stunt, she can use specialties in other Abilities on Awareness rolls using the enhanced sense This Charm lasts one scene for three motes or indefinitely for six motes, one Willpower.
The Abyssal can repurchase this Charm to select an additional set of senses. She must pay this Charm’s cost separately for each set she enhances but can enhance multiple sets of senses with a single activation.
