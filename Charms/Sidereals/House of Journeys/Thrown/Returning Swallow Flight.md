*The Sidereal’s grip lingers on her weapon even after it leaves her hand, carried toward her enemy to drag him back.*
An enemy damaged by the Sidereal’s decisive attack is dragged one range band toward her. If he collides with an object or surface, he suffers an additional (Thrown/2, rounded up) dice of decisive damage, ignoring [[Hardness]]. This is normally bashing, though some impacts may deal lethal damage.
