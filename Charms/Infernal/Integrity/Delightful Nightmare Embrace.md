*The shifting chaos of the Wyld is as ephemeral as a dream to the Infernal, evanescent nightmares that fade upon waking.*

The Infernal and her equipment can’t truly be affected by environmental Shaping effects. Any changes that she suffers are illusory and fade away as soon as she leaves the Shaping effect’s area. They still appear real, and are convincing enough that the Infernal suffers any downsides they’d usually cause. If she doesn’t like that, she can commit five motes and pay one Willpower to render an effect truly illusory, causing no impediment at all. She can maintain this commitment indefinitely, protecting herself against all environmental Shaping she faces.
