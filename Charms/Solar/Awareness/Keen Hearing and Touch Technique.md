The Lawgiver listens with the intensity of an owl, and feels movement in the world like a spider feels a touch against its web. The Exalt may identify fabrics and minerals she knows with a cursory touch, and can hear at frequencies several times lower than a human. She can listen clearly to conversations through thick stone walls, hear creatures burrowing in the ground, ants marching on the branches above her head, and other, similar feats. For many actions that would require success on a roll at difficulty 2, the Solar can succeed without a roll. For more difficult actions, the difficulty is lowered by 1, and the Solar gains one automatic success. If she has a specialty that can be logically applied to the roll, the difficulty drops to 1. For example, a Solar who is unfamiliar with art crime will find it more difficult to identify a faked painting by touch than a Solar with an [[Investigation]] specialty in detecting forgeries. These benefits do not apply to detecting opponents in stealth. This Charm follows the special activation rules of [[Keen Sight Technique]] (p. 267).
