The Yozis understand violence. The Exalted of the traitor gods stained their blades with Primordial ichor and slaughtered their pantheons of souls. They watched in horror as the Neverborn were murdered, an atrocity that shook the entire cosmos. And when at last the Primordials were forced to surrender, were they shown the dignity due to them in defeat? No. They were mutilated, torture, and remade, forced to bind themselves with oaths of surrender sworn upon their own names.

The Yozis seek their [[Azimuth]] Castes from those who share the same scars: the maimed, the defeated, those laid low and those left to grieve the dead. It might be a battle-hardened soldier, bearing wounds from countless battles, or the victim of that soldier’s army as it pillaged the countryside. For other candidates, their torment might have been violent bullying, corporeal punishment, or beatings at that hands of parents, spouses, or slave masters. Some bear the wounds of grief at the violent death of another — the war widow who craves the power to avenge her beloved, the idealist whose life is shattered when a beloved friend is murdered. The demons who come to them offer strength beyond imagining, the power to cut down those who’ve wronged them and to never again suffer such pain.

The Yozis delight in the carnage wrought by their Slayers, no matter whose blood is shed. They are masters of violence, whether it’s a skill honed by years of experience or an aptitude newly discovered with their Exaltation. They are warriors and champions, strategists and war leaders, hired killers and war-sorcerers. Some shed blood in pursuit of passions or ambition, while others turn their blades to nobler ends as monstrous guardians of the weak or vigilantes who slaughter the wicked.

The Demon City offers a grand battlefield for Brass Tigers who seek one, whether carving out a fiefdom of their own or leading an army of the damned at the behest of a demonic patron. Others find employ as champions, bodyguards, enforcers, assassins, or military advisors. Some Slayers seek tutelage from demon mentors, whether learning warcraft from Madelrada, That Which Wears Down the Mountains, or studying forbidden martial arts styles within the Forty-Nine Chambers of the living academy Suntarankal.
# Caste Mark
An emerald sunburst with eight rays, with the larger diagonal cross rays emphasizing a centre without a circle.
# Anima Banner
An [[Azimuth]] Caste’s blazing green [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Levels|anima banner]] glints like brass. Some roar or scream as they flare to light, while others might sound of brazen war drums, the marching-chants of demonic armies, or fires burning on the battlefield. Their anima banners might smell of blood, brass, or thick smoke.
# Iconic Anima
The Infernal’s Devil-Body; a horde of monstrous figures that march behind the Infernal; a demonic siege engine that spits blood and molten brass; a wrathful behemoth whose rampage mirrors the Infernal’s movements; a rain of rune-etched blades or sizzling blood falling from the sky; a many-headed tiger of verdigrised brass; demonic arms emanating from the Infernal, each bearing a weapon or posed in a martial technique.
# Anima Effects
An [[Azimuth]] Caste’s anima enhances her killing prowess and lets her enter her Devil-Body when wounded.

In addition to the default [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Effects|anima effects]], [[Azimuth]] Castes can perform the following:
- **Ceaseless Slaughter Momentum** (Permanent): At [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Levels|bonfire anima]], the Infernal adds (Essence/2, rounded up) to her base Initiative when she resets to base Initiative after a decisive attack.
- **Green Sun Dawning** (—; Reflexive; Instant): While the Infernal is at [[The Anima Banner#Infernal Anima Levels|burning anima]] or higher, she rolls (Essence + highest Physical Attribute) dice and gains peripheral motes. They can only be spent on magic that creates or enhances attacks, and can be used as sorcerous motes instead for spells that do so. Once per day.
- **Towering Demon Emperor** (Permanent): The Infernal can enter her Devil-Body when she takes damage to a −4 health level while fighting in support of a Major or Defining Intimacy, as long as she has no more than (Essence/2, rounded up) undamaged −4 health levels remaining.
