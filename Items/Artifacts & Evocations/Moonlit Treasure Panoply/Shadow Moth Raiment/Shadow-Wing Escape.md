Unable to follow the wearer’s movements, no enemy can strike true against her.
The wearer can use this Evocation after a withering attack beats her Evasion, but before the damage roll. The damage roll suffers a −2 penalty, or a −3 penalty if the wearer received Fluttering Step’s Evasion bonus against the attack.
Alternatively, a player character might have made an enemy of the troupe when they took the Shadow Moth Raiment. If the troupe’s efforts to reclaim the artifact make them a recurring antagonist, this counts as a Flaw (Exalted, p. 167).
If the wearer takes no damage, it’s revealed that her movements misled her attacker — what he struck was only a cloud of moths from the raiment. The wearer is actually somewhere within short range of her apparent position. This counts as dodging the attack. There must be a clear path between the two points.
With an Essence 2 repurchase, the wearer can pay a twomote, two-Initiative surcharge to use this Evocation against a decisive attack.
## Dissonant
The Essence 2 repurchase’s effect can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing an unexpected attack against a nontrivial enemy.
