*All weapons bend to the Abyssal’s superior killing power, betraying their masters to serve in the hand of death incarnate.*
When an enemy within short range is disarmed, the deathknight may pay a two-mote, two [[Initiative]] surcharge to use [[Blade-Summoning Gesture]] on his weapon to call it to her hand. If she fails the ([[Wits]] + [[Melee]]) roll, the weapon still flies to her hand, but it can be prevented if an enemy readies it before her next turn.
Alternatively, the Abyssal can pay use [[Blade-Summoning Gesture]] for a two-mote, two-[[Initiative]] surcharge to enhance her own disarm gambit, wresting a weapon from her enemy’s hand and summoning it to her own. She can target an enemy within short range and rolls the attack with ([[Wits]] + [[Melee]]). If successful, his weapon instantly flashes to her hand without crossing the intervening space. This gambit isn’t made with the Abyssal’s own weapon, but by her will alone.
