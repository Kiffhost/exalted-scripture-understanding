The Sidereal looks away as she cuts short a strand of fate, weeping tears like falling stars. The Sidereal can pay a five-mote surcharge when she uses Descending Endings Horoscope to name the general method or circumstances of her victim’s impending death — “poisoned,” “betrayed,” “at sea,” “by heart attack,” etc. Trivial characters die in this fashion, or the nearest possible equivalent, within no more than five days. A nontrivial character suffers Descending Endings Horoscope’s target number increase on all rolls that would directly aid in avoiding the specified death. When he encounters circumstances in which he might die that way, he rolls (Wits + Integrity) at difficulty (Sidereal’s Essence), losing one Willpower if he fails. If he dies this way, it counts as a fulfilled auspicious prospect (p. XX).
