The Dragon-Blood guides her companions through the deepest forests and harshest climes. She may commit an additional seven motes when she uses Invoking Nature’s Forgiveness to increase the rate at which she and the other affected characters can travel through wilderness. If they’re traveling through normal wilderness, they can cover (Essence + 10) miles with a single day’s march. Extremely harsh terrain or weather halves the distance they can cover, such as when hiking through a blizzard or climbing a mountain’s face. If multiple Dragon-Blooded stack the benefits of Invoking Nature’s Forgiveness, the Essence bonus also applies to this Charm to determine the distance that can be covered. Only one of them needs to know and use Tireless Caravan Prana to yield this benefit.
