*Death’s Lawgiver bends the Underworld to her will, as if it were no more than another nightmare of the Neverborn.*
The Abyssal can use this Charm to shape the Underworld to her will. She can only use it within the Underworld proper, not including shadowlands. She can shape an area that extends out to (Essence x5) miles from her. She can’t shape inhabited regions if their denizens don’t want her to.
This shaping is an extended (Intelligence + Lore) action with a one-minute interval, requiring a separate use of this Charm for each interval. The goal number depends on the effect the Abyssal wishes to invoke. Once she reaches the goal number, she can continue the shaping with a new effect, resetting her successes to zero. The roll has a base difficulty of 5, subject to the following modifiers:
CONDITION DIFFICULTY MODIFIER Shaping a primal or ritual afterlife +2 Shaping the Labyrinth −2 Each roll past the first +1 For example, an Abyssal who uses this Charm in the Labyrinth would roll first at difficulty 3, then difficulty 4, difficulty 5, and so on.
The Abyssal can make one of the following alterations once she reaches its goal number. Some require her to first lay groundwork with other alterations — most notably, erasing existing terrain features to make way for new lands.
Erase Terrain (Goal Number 5): The Abyssal eliminates a major feature of the landscape — a river, a mountain, a fortress. It fades away gradually, leaving barren wasteland in its place. Using this in ritual and primal afterlives can’t override their fundamental nature; whatever remains will still be thematically appropriate to them. Manses and other supernatural features can’t be erased, but don’t prevent the Abyssal from shaping around them.
Alter Terrain (Goal Number 10): Once the Abyssal has erased all terrain features, she can remake the land. She creates a new terrain feature, raising up a hill out of the earth, opening a lake, or growing a forest of living bone.
She can also add natural resources to the land, like veins of precious metal or deposits of the ore used to forge soulsteel. Particularly drastic changes may require multiple uses of this effect — creating a mountain to rival the Underworld’s tallest would require one use to create a hill, another to expand it into a mountain, and further uses to make it even larger. When shaping a primal or ritual afterlife, anything she creates will manifest in a way that fits their themes, regardless of what she intends.
Demesnes (Goal Number 20 or 30): After creating a terrain feature, the deathknight may transform it into an Abyssal demesne. This has a goal number of 20 for two-dot demesnes and 30 for four-dot demesnes.
Objects and Structures (Goal Number 3, 10, or 20):
After creating natural resources, the Abyssal can shape them into mundane objects or structures suited to the landscape she’s created. She could raise a funereal citadel from a mountain’s stone or shape veins of precious metal into jewelry for a reshaped necropolis’ ghostly populace. The goal number depends on the type of project that would be necessary to create the object:
3 for basic, 10 for major, and 20 for superior. Such creations often appear eerie, uncanny, or disturbing.
Soulsteel (Goal Number 30): After creating the necessary ore, the Abyssal can shape it into soulsteel by binding ghosts within it. These unfortunate shades must either be willing or helpless. Creating enough soulsteel for an artifact weapon or armor requires at least five ghosts or a single powerful shade. Creating enough soulsteel for multiple such artifacts or larger artifacts like warstriders require an additional use of this Charm to expand the shaped soulsteel — potentially more than one, depending on the scope of the Abyssal’s ambitions. Each use requires more and more ghosts, up to as many as a hundred per interval.
### Monstrosities
The Abyssal populates the shaped region with a nightmarish horror, with traits like those created by Night-Horror Summons.
The Abyssal can continue shaping for as long as she can pay this Charm’s cost. The roll’s difficulty resets to its starting value each time she completes an alteration. She can act freely while shaping, including in combat, but can’t take other extended actions. This Charm ends prematurely if the Abyssal fails a roll for it or is incapacitated.
Shaping the Underworld risks stirring dark forces. If she rolls six 1s in a single interval, the Storyteller may declare that a formidable threat is drawn to her or that she faces a peril like an earthquake or sudden storm as the shaped terrain rebels against her. Each interval, the number of 1s needed to trigger this is reduced by one, minimum (Abyssal’s Essence). If the Abyssal rolls more 1s than necessary, she may face even greater perils, like an undead behemoth rising from the Labyrinth.
