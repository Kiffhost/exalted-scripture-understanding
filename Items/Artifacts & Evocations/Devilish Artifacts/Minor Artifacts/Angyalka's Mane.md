Grown from the prehensile hair of the demon-harpists known as angyalkae, this living artifact merges with its wielder’s own hair (or scalp) when attuned for three motes. Extending down to knee-length, it can be used as an additional limb that’s just as dextrous as her dominant hand. It can be used to make unarmed attacks with the Flexible and Grappling tags, and adds one die on grapple attack and control rolls. However, it’s not compatible with Martial Arts other than Black Claw style, Dreaming Pearl Courtesan style, and similarly elegant styles the Storyteller deems suitable.
