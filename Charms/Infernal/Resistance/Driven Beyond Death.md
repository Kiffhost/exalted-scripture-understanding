*The Infernal knows nothing of death or defeat. Woe betide any who dare to test her immortality.*

The Infernal can only use this Charm on her turn. She can’t be reduced below Initiative 1 by a withering attack unless it’s enhanced by magic and at least one of the following applies:
- The Infernal’s attacker has an Initiative that’s at least ten higher than hers.
- The Infernal has only (attacker’s Essence/2, rounded up) undamaged health levels remaining.
- The attack’s damage is unsoakable.
- The Infernal is prone.

While the Infernal is at Initiative 1, she adds (Stamina/2, rounded up) dice of damage on decisive attacks and ignores (Stamina) points of Hardness. 

If the Infernal is incapacitated, she remains conscious, postponing incapacitation for as long as this Charm remains active.

At the start of each of her turns, the Infernal must pay one mote to sustain this Charm. It ends if she’s crashed.
## Reset
Once per scene.

#### Hate Never Dies
The Infernal adds (Essence/2, rounded up) to the minimum Initiative value she can’t be reduced below. She gains this Charm’s offensive benefits while at that Initiative value or lower.
