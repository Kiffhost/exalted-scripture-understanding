The Immaculate concludes the katas of Earth Dragon Form by dropping to her hands and knees, humbling herself before Pasiap. As she rises, her body twists and shifts as Earth Essence suffuses it, her skin becoming rough and craggy as her body hardens into living stone. Upon entering Earth Dragon Form, she may pay six motes, six Initiative, and one Willpower to enhance it. When she attacks a prone enemy or makes a smash attack, she adds (Stamina) raw withering damage or decisive damage. She’s immune to all wound penalties, as well as crippling penalties inflicted by effects such as Joint-Wounding Attack or Crippling Pressure-Point Strike. If the Immaculate is unarmored, the soak bonus from Earth Dragon Form rises to (Willpower + Strength), and she gains Hardness (Strength + Stamina).
