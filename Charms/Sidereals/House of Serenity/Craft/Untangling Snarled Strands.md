Even the most terrifying and alien horrors can bring joy and prosperity to the world; the Sidereal offers them a chance to do so. The Sidereal stitches a willing enemy of fate into the tapestry of reality, freeing it from this status. The blessed character’s Essence is marked by his newly loyalty to Creation; gods, elementals, and Sidereals recognize its newfound status. If such characters have negative Ties to a category of beings that the blessed character belongs to — e.g., “demons,” “Anathema,” “otherworldly beings” — they treat those Intimacy’s intensity as one step lower against him. If the blessed character intentionally acts in opposition to destiny, he’s stripped of these benefits. His treachery reverberates through fate’s weave and turns back against him sevenfold; he suffers a cosmic punishment appropriate to his crime as if he’d broken an oath sanctified by the Eclipse anima (Exalted, p. 176). Acts that threaten the well-being of Creation itself, like opening shadowlands or spreading bordermarches, likewise revoke this blessing. The Sidereal glimpses this act of treachery in a fleeting vision; successfully remedying the damage done counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect.
