*When a Solar raises [[Zelator]] as her battle standard, neither witches nor devils can stand against her forces.*
This Evocation can be used in strategic warfare (Exalted, p. 211) against an enemy general relying on [[sorcery]], geomantic power, spirits, or other magic the Storyteller deems overtly supernatural. This is a magical stratagem with threshold 1, leading from the front as [[Zelator]] blazes like the sun with holy light. If she successfully implements this stratagem, her entire army gains [[Might]] 1 and shares Zelator’s power to make baneful attacks for the rest of the scene. In addition, mounted allies each gain the benefits of [[Spell-Piercing Strike]] on their first baneful impaling attack this scene.
