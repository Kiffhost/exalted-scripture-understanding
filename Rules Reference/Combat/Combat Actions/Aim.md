The character spends a few moments taking aim at his intended target. The player must declare which target he is taking aim at when he uses this action. Should his character attack that target on his next turn, the attack gains a +3 bonus. If the target moves out of the weapon’s range or behind [[Cover#Full]] before the character’s next turn, this action is wasted. 

An aim action is required before an attack can be made from [[Range#Medium]] or greater, even one assisted by magic; attacks from medium or greater range don’t gain a +3 bonus unless two consecutive turns are spent aiming. 

**Characters cannot move and aim during the same round without some form of magic to permit it. This action cannot be placed in a flurry.**
