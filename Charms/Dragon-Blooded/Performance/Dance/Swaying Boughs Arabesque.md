Moving with sensuous rhythm and vivacious appeal, the Dragon-Blood embodies beauty through dance. This Charm supplements a [[Performance]] roll to dance, lowering the [[Resolve]] of all targets by 1. This both lowers the difficulty of the roll and potentially increases the bonus dice added by the Exaltâ€™s [[Appearance]] (Exalted, p. 371).
