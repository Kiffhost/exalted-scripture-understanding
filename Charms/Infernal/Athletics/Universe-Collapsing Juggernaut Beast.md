*The Infernal expands beyond her physical form, a roiling midnight cosmos that shines with dying stars. Then, in an instant, she collapses, compressing infinity into human form.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- While her physical size doesn’t change, she counts as being larger than everyone and everything else, and can grapple, throw, and knock back Legendary Size enemies regardless of their bulk. Others may briefly perceive her as far larger than she is, seeming to tower over mountains or fill the entire universe.
- She can’t be forcibly moved, whether by physical means or by magic that transports others, like [[Prison-World Carbuncle Extrusion]] (p. XX).
- She adds (Strength) to the raw damage of withering unarmed attacks and one die of damage on decisive unarmed attacks. If an unarmed attack deals decisive damage, her enemy is knocked back one range band and falls prone.
- Her nigh-infinite density causes her to smash through any easily-breakable surfaces. However, she can choose to float slightly above the ground to avoid this.

The Infernal’s transformation also enhances certain Charms:
- She can convert up to (Essence + Strength) dice added by [[God-Monster Thew]] to non-Charm successes on feats of strength.
- She waives [[World-Warping Charge|World-Warping Charge’s]] cost and the surcharge from its [[World-Warping Charge#Rippling Reality Tread (Athletics 4, Essence 2) (+2m)|Rippling Reality Tread]] key.
- She waives [[Infinite Might Expansion|Infinite Might Expansion’s]] cost and reset condition.
- She increases [[Meteor Hoofprint Stomp|Meteor Hoofprint Stomp’s]] range to long and adds (Essence) non-Charm successes on its roll.
## Special activation rules
The Infernal can use [[Meteor Hoofprint Stomp]] reflexively with this Charm, waiving its Willpower cost.
### Blasphemy
The Infernal can use this Charm reflexively when she enters her [[Devil-Body]]. She waives its Willpower cost if her [[Devil-Body]] has [[Exalted-Specific Rules/Infernal/Devil-Body Powers/Legendary Size|Legendary Size]].
