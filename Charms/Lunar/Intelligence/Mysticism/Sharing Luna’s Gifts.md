*The Lunar shares her protean [[Essence]] with another, anointing him with her sacred blood.*
She grants a willing character up to five dots of mutations reflecting an animal whose shape she possesses. The beneficiary need not be human, but must be living. Player characters incur [[Experience Debt]] (p. XX) for gaining mutations in this way; a given Storyteller character can only benefit from this Charm once per story. This Charmâ€™s health level cost is waived if the Lunar grants herself mutations.
