The Solar might grow to consider her allies to be an extension of her self. With a touch, the Lawgiver may use Empathic Aegis Discipline to deepen this connection. If the Solar has a Major or Defining Tie for a character who shares one of her Defining Principles, when the subject feels physical or emotional agony the Solar senses it and understands the context of their suffering. This is not a debilitating experience — a subject losing a hand does not have the same impact on the Solar. But she does understand that he’s been caught thieving and is being punished. If the subject is somewhere the Lawgiver has been, this Charm makes her aware of the subject’s whereabouts. If not, she gets a general sense of direction and (greater of Essence or three) non-Charm successes to Awareness, Investigation, or Survival to find them. At Essence 4+, the cost of this Charm drops to three motes. 

## Special activation rules

As long as the Solar has committed this Charm to at least one character, it automatically applies to every character that is bound to her through a magically powerful oath such as one produced through sorcery or the Eclipse anima power.

### On Empathic Aegis Discipline

The backer asked for a Charm that would let him sense when his closest allies were in peril. For those of you who are wondering which Ability to use in order to find someone with this Charm, think of Awareness, Investigation, and Survival in terms of distances. If your friend has been tied, weighted, and thrown into a canal running through a busy city, you might be close enough — say, inside a nearby building — that upon emerging, you use Awareness Charms to hear their heartbeat at the bottom of the river, applying this Charm’s bonus to your attempt. But say they’re across the city, in a warehouse you’ve never seen, and someone is torturing them to reveal a secret. In that case, you would want to use Investigation Charms to try to find evidence of the abduction. But over a much larger distance, like a vast woodland, you would use Survival to track someone. Note that Awareness based Solar Charms are always helpful in noticing clues with Investigation or using Survival to see the minutest traces of a presence that has disturbed a natural environment.
