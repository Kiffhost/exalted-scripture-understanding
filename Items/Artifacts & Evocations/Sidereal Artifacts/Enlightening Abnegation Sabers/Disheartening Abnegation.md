*The wielder leaves her enemyâ€™s heart as empty as his hands.*
If the wielder knows an Intimacy of a character she makes a disarm gambit against, success causes him to suffer (Intimacy) unsoakable withering damage and then weakens the Intimacy by one step. The wielder can gain Initiative from this, but if she does, she gains the disarmed Intimacy at Minor intensity.
