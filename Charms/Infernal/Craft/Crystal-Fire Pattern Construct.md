*The Infernal crystallizes natural law into a tangible force, defining her surroundings in accordance with her design.*

The Infernal can use this Charm on her turn to create a simple, geometric form out of hardened force at a point within short range of her. She can only use it once per turn. She can create constructs of sufficient size and thickness to provide light cover (Exalted, p. 199), but can also create platforms, bridges, ramps, or the like. She can’t create constructs large enough to span multiple range bands.

A feat of demolition to destroy the construct requires a minimum Strength of (Essence + Intelligence) and has difficulty (Essence + Willpower). Environmental hazards and similar sources of harm can damage or destroy them, at the Storyteller’s discretion, but they’re immune to environmental hazards with damage lower than (higher of Infernal’s Essence or 3).

At the end of the scene, the Infernal’s constructs dissolve into translucent white light.
## [[Keys]]
#### Conceptual Structure Reinforcement
The Infernal can create constructs large enough to provide heavy cover.
#### Crystal-Fire Barrier Technique (Essence 2) (+3i)
The Infernal can pay a three-Initiative surcharge to use this Charm outside of her turn. She can use this in response to an attack against her or an ally, interposing the construct to provide cover against that one attack without the need for a take cover roll. There’s no limit on how many times the Infernal can use this key in a round.
#### Crystalline Pattern Expansion (Craft 5, Essence 3, [[#Conceptual Structure Reinforcement]])
The Infernal can create a construct large enough to span up to (Essence + 1) range bands. She can also create constructs that floats stationary in mid-air, without needing to attach it to any surface.
