*Countless chains twist and coil around the deathknight’s victims, imprisoning them in the Abyssal’s iron grasp.*
While using [[Chain-and-Armor Mortification]], the Abyssal makes a grapple gambit against all enemies within close range or up to ([[Stamina]]) enemies within her chains’ full range. She makes only one attack roll and [[Initiative]] roll against all enemies, but rolls ([[Strength]] + [[Brawl]]) separately to establish control against each enemy.
While clinching multiple enemies, the Abyssal’s grapple actions are expanded:
Savage: The Abyssal makes a single savaging attack roll against any number of grappled enemies.
Withering attacks roll damage separately against each grappled foe. Only the single highest withering damage roll awards [[Initiative]] to the Abyssal, although she can receive [[Initiative]] Breaks for crashing multiple foes. Decisive savaging attacks divide her [[Initiative]] evenly among all foes (rounded up) to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring [[Hardness]].
Restrain/Drag: The Abyssal can restrain any number of grappled enemies or drag them in the same direction. This costs two rounds of control for each enemy.
Throw/Slam: The Abyssal can throw or slam any number of grappled enemies in the same direction.
This follows the same rules as savaging attacks.
