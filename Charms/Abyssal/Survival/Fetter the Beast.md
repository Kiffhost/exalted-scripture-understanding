*The deathknight binds a familiar to her, forging a bond of service to endure eternity.*
The Abyssal confers the following benefits on one of her animal familiars:
Barghest’s Feast Hunger: When the familiar deals decisive damage to an enemy with a mote pool, the Abyssal steals one mote from him. She can’t gain more than (higher of [[Essence]] or 3) motes this way per round, even if she has multiple enhanced familiars. She may choose whether to drain personal or peripheral motes, adding them to the same pool she steals from.
Dread Companion Bond: Once per day, the Abyssal can gain one [[Willpower]] from interacting with the familiar. If their interaction serves death’s chivalry, she may lose one [[Limit]] instead. Even if the Abyssal has multiple familiars enhanced with this Charm, she can only use this power once each day.
Ghost-Ridden Beast: When the Abyssal shares her familiar’s senses (Exalted, p. 161), she ignores the range limit, and she can do so even while asleep. With [[Survival]] 5, she can control her familiar’s actions while sharing senses.
Undying Loyalty: The familiar gains a Defining Tie of loyalty to the deathknight. Any influence that would make it act against this tie is unacceptable, unless it’s the Abyssal’s own influence.
This Charm’s experience point cost is waived the first time the Abyssal uses it.
Experience Point Refunds Experience points spent on [[Charms]] that enhance a specific familiar are refunded if that familiar dies or is otherwise permanently removed from the game.
