*“We must strive to remember for as long as we can. Anything else would be a betrayal.”*

The wearer makes a special (Appearance + {Performance or Presence}) inspire roll against a single character within short range who can see her, captivating him with the robe’s hypnotic patterns. Success causes the target to lose (wearer’s Appearance) Initiative and inflicts a Minor Obsession with learning about or celebrating Itreyoun (Exalted, p. 169). If he already has such an Obsession, it’s instead strengthened by one step As long as a character has an Obsession, he suffers a penalty equal to its intensity to his Guile and Resolve against the wearer. He suffers the same penalty on the raw damage and Overwhelming of his withering attacks against her. If she uses [[Forgotten Woven Dreams]] against his attacks, this penalty subtracts post-soak withering damage instead, and penalizes decisive attacks’ damage too.

This influence can’t be resisted with Willpower. The inflicted Obsession fades by one step every (10 − target’s Resolve) days. If he spends much of a day indulging his Obsession, it doesn’t count toward this Once the Obsession fades entirely, he forgets all he knows of Itreyoun. He can choose to keep the Obsession from fading to preserve these memories.
### Dissonant
The Obsession fades by one step each time the target gains Willpower from resting, unless he spent much of the day before indulging it.
### Resonant
The Obsession fades by one step each month, or each year for mortals and First Circle demons. The wearer waives this Evocation’s Willpower cost when using it to strengthen existing Obsessions.
