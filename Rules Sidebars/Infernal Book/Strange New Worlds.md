While inner worlds can offer many benefits, obtaining them isn’t effortless. If the Infernal wishes to amass power or assets comparable to a Story Merit like [[Merits/Command|Command]], [[Cult]], or [[Resources]], she’ll still need to engage with the inner world’s setting to recruit troops, amass riches, or the like. The world’s denizens aren’t loyal to the Infernal by default, though trivial characters tend toward a favourable disposition.
