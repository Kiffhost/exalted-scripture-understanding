Under the Lunar’s instruction, young cubs untested in battle become grizzled warriors hungry for blood. She spends a month training a battle group of up to [[Size]] ([Charisma or Stamina] − 1), or [[Size]] ([[Charisma]] or [[Stamina]]) if it has [[Might]]. Completing the training increases the battle group’s [[Drill]] by one step, and grants its members the following benefits: 
-  +1 dot of [[Willpower]], maximum 5. 
-  +1 die on [[Join Battle]] rolls, maximum 10. 
-  +1 die on all attack rolls, maximum 10. 
-  +1 Parry, maximum 5. This Charm can’t train Exalted, player characters, or other beings whose nature makes them inappropriate for inclusion in battle groups.
