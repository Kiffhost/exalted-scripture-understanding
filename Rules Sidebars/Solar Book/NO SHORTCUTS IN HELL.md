Demons of the Second Circle and other entities that can be summoned by powerful [[sorcery]] are sometimes initiated into [[sorcery]] themselves. A player might think that he could just have a demon perform a sorcerous working for him, allowing him to reap the benefit without having to pay the experience point cost of the working. Sadly for him, this isn’t the case. The experience spent to finalize a sorcerous working represents the sorcerer’s time and effort to bring the working into being, and summoning a demon to aid in undertaking the working is just another aspect of that effort. While having a bound demon will certainly help complete the working successfully—enhancing the sorcerer’s Means, generally—it won’t let the sorcerer avoid having to pay the experience point cost.
