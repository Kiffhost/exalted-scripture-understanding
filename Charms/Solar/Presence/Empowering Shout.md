*Even bound in chains, the Lawgiver can inspire a subject to the heights of prowess.*
This Charm is a simple turnlength action in which the Solar exhorts a character to his true greatness. Such a character gains a +1 non-Charm bonus to one Attribute and Ability until his next turn. The Solar might call upon a strongman to lift rubble from a trapped family, increasing his [[Strength]] and [[Athletics]] by one each, or empower her guardian to strike swift and true, increasing his [[Dexterity]] and [[Melee]], and so on. The Solar may also choose instead to raise her chargeâ€™s [[Defense]] by one, but if this raises it past seven it counts as dice added by a Charm. [[Empowering Shout]] does not stack. At [[Essence]] 4+, the Exalt can use this Charm to grant +2 to one Attribute and Ability or +2 to a [[Defense]].
