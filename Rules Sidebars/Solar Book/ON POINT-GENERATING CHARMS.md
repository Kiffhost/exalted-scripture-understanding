Charms such as Supreme Perfection of Craft only function if the Solar is actively using Craft in each story. A character who sleeps a thousand years will not awaken to an infinity of craft points awaiting her. Likewise, a character who spends a season lazing about Dajaz and romancing the revelers there should not accrue very many points in general. These awards are specifically furnished for those who are extremely hard working crafters and inventers by nature. Characters who also spend many scenes studying, researching, tinkering, or performing sorcerous projects or medical experiments also qualify for these rewards, as long as they use Craft intermittently.
