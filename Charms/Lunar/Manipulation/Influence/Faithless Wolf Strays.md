A master of self-deception, the Lunar argues against her own ideals. When she bolsters her [[Resolve]] with a [[Intimacy|Tie]] to an individual, it can’t be penalized by Ties toward groups or Principles if they have lower intensity (though they may still support persuade actions). If the bolstering [[Intimacy|Tie]] is toward her Solar mate, such [[Intimacy|Intimacies]] can’t penalize her [[Resolve]] unless they’re of greater intensity.
