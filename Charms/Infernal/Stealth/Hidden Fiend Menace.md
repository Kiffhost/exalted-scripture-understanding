*The Infernal is not seen before her victim’s demise, is not seen as his corpse lies cooling.*

The Infernal doubles 9s on a Stealth roll. If she beats a character’s Awareness roll and makes an unexpected attack against him on or before her next turn, she adds an automatic success on the attack roll.
## [[Keys]]
#### Infernal Assassin Expertise (Stealth 4)
As long as the Infernal has Initiative 6+, she ignores the −3 penalty for attempting Stealth in combat.
#### Where Did It Go? (Stealth 4, Essence 2, [[#Infernal Assassin Expertise (Stealth 4)|Infernal Assassin Expertise]]) (+2m)
For a two-mote surcharge, the Infernal can steal (Essence) Initiative from an enemy whose opposed roll fails against her Stealth. He gains a Minor Tie of fear toward her. If multiple enemies fail, the Infernal chooses one of them.
#### Could Be Anywhere (Stealth 5, Essence 3, [[#Where Did It Go? (Stealth 4, Essence 2, Infernal Assassin Expertise (Stealth 4) Infernal Assassin Expertise ) (+2m)|Where Did It Go?]])
The Infernal can pay an additional one-Willpower surcharge when she uses [[#Where Did It Go? (Stealth 4, Essence 2, Infernal Assassin Expertise (Stealth 4) Infernal Assassin Expertise ) (+2m)|Where Did It Go?]] to steal Initiative from up to (Wits) enemies. She halves the Initiative stolen from each enemy past the first, rounded up. The Willpower cost is refunded if the Infernal doesn’t steal Initiative from multiple enemies.
