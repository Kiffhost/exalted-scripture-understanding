*Pra Gita’s talons sink into their victim’s flesh, elongating and digging deep to pierce the hearts of the faithless.*
The wielder adds ([[Essence]]) raw damage on a withering attack, or rerolls ([[Essence]]) 1s on a decisive damage roll.
Against the unfaithful, the withering damage is post-soak damage, while the wielder can reroll any failed dice on decisive damage rolls, not just 1s. Decisive attacks also deal aggravated damage against the unfaithful.
