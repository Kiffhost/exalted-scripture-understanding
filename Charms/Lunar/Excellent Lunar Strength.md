Add dice to an ([[Strength]] + Ability) roll for 1 mote per die.

The [[Strength]] Excellency can add dice to a [[Strength]]-based [[Attack#withering|withering]] [[Attack#raw damage|damage roll]] before [[soak]], this  costs 1 mote per damage die maximum (Strength/2 rounded down).

While damage rolls can’t be stunted, players can still raise the dice caps for these with a suitable description per the usual [[stunt]] rules, although this doesn’t add any other benefits of stunting.
