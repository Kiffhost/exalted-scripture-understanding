*In order to shape a daiklave or other [[Artifact]] weapon from !!theWyld,theSolarmustbecapableofagreaterrefinement!! of [[Wyld-Shaping Technique]].*
This Charm models Solars who have mastered one such refinement. In order to create an [[Artifact]] four weapon with one active Evocation, the Exalt must reach phase four and use this Charm before the roll is made. To draw forth a greater weapon such as a Thousand-Year [[Daiklave]], the Solar must proceed to phase !!five,whileaTen-ThousandYearDaiklavecanonlybemade!! at phase six. All weapons created in this manner possess one active Evocation. If the Solar intends to shape such a weapon, each phase is spent creating a narrative vector through which the weapon can be materialized. The form this description takes is entirely up to the player.
