The Solar whirls like a mad conductor, hurling precision strikes in every direction. The Solar targets up to (Dexterity + 2) enemies out to short range with a barrage of Thrown disarm, distract, or unhorse gambits. Each attack is rolled separately, and each gambit is difficulty 1. The Solar need not aim to use this Charm. While this Charm is in effect, Spitting Hand Technique costs zero motes, and if she knows Whirlwind Hand of the Striker she may also throw snaring grapple gambits. At Essence 4+, the Lawgiver may activate Death-Dealing Diffusion as if it were a Supplemental-type Charm while under the effect of Dancing Steel Symphony. This raises the difficulty of each gambit to 2, but drops the Willpower cost from that Charm, requiring the Solar to instead pay one mote for each gambit she wishes to double.

### On Dancing Steel Symphony

Sometimes a Night Caste needs to knock down, unhorse, and snare an entire warehouse full of thugs as she passes casually through their attempted ambush.
