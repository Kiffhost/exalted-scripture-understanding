The thunderstorm is born from many clouds, each one casting its lightning from horizon to horizon. When the Exalt uses [[Eternal Mind Meditation]] to introduce a fact, she may pay one additional [[Willpower]] to draw from the wisdom of up to ([[Intelligence]] − 1, minimum one) willing Dragon-Blooded within medium range of her. Each Dragon-Blood that contributes his wisdom adds a single non-Charm die on her roll, as well as contributing the whole of his memories and any [[Lore]] backgrounds he possesses to the body of information on which the introduced fact is based. On a successful [[Lore]] roll, all participating Dragon-Blooded form a Major Tie of loyalty to the Dragon-Blooded as a whole.
