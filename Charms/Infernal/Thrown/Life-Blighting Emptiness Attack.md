*The Infernal’s spiteful cruelty cuts all that gives life meaning.*

When the Infernal makes a decisive attack against an enemy with lower Initiative, she adds (Essence) dice of damage and doubles 10s on the damage roll. Her target loses motes equal to the levels of damage he suffers, to a maximum of (Infernal’s Essence + damage roll 10s) motes. Black, tarry Essence oozes from his eyes or mouth as his Essence bleeds away.
## [[Keys]]
#### Ever-Hungry Shadow Affliction (Essence 2)
The Infernal gains the motes lost by her target. She can’t gain more than (Manipulation) motes this way in a single round, or (Manipulation x2) at Essence 3.
#### Spite-Fed Wounding Nimbus (Essence 3) (+1wp)
When the Infernal attacks a crashed enemy, she can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to convert the added damage dice into automatic successes. Each of these automatic successes counts as a 10 for determining the maximum number of motes her target can lose.
