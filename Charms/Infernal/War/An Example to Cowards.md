*The Infernal has no use soldiers who cannot heed her orders, except as an example to others.*

The Infernal reflexively makes a rally roll. If she succeeds, the rallied battle group gains a Tie of terrified awe to her, or strengthens an existing Tie by one.

If the Infernal stunts her roll with a description of cutting down soldiers who break rank or an equally violent display, she succeeds automatically. However, the battle group suffers a point of Magnitude damage upon reforming.
