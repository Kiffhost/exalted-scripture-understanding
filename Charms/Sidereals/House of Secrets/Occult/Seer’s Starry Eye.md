*The Sidereal has an intuitive understanding of astrological divinations, fortune telling, and similar folk magics.*
The Sidereal gains the Thaumaturgist Merit and the two-dot Astrological Horoscope ritual or a similar fortune-telling or divinatory ritual. She may subsequently learn up to four dots worth of thaumaturgical rituals of any kind for no experience point cost, although she must have access to a tutor.
This Charm can be repurchased up to (Essence/2, rounded up) times, letting the Sidereal learn five additional dots of rituals for each purchase.
