*Details When the wicked refuse to speak, the world answers for them.*
The Sidereal can use this Charm when someone fails to answer a question or gives an answer she thinks is dishonest or evasive. This can occur either in ordinary conversation or when a character successfully defends against influence to convince him to answer.
In the next scene, the Sidereal is assured to encounter a piece of evidence that will reveal any information the speaker withheld, whether by fortuitous circumstance or the aid of a helpful nature spirit. If the speaker didn’t withhold anything, the evidence instead reveals this fact.
The Storyteller should tell the Sidereal’s player when she encounters the clue. She can uncover it with a case scene roll opposing the speaker’s Guile. If successful, she gains one Willpower.
Against Charms and other effects capable of contesting truth-detecting magic, the Sidereal must roll (Perception + Investigation) opposing that effect to use this Charm. The difficulty to uncover the evidence is equal to the other character’s successes on the opposed roll, if they’re higher than his Guile.
