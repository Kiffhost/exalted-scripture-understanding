The Terrestrial’s anima pours into her palms as burning flames, wreathing her weapon in an aura of explosive Essence. To use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must have Initiative 12+. She makes a decisive attack that detonates on impact, adding (Essence) dice of damage and rolling an additional die of damage for every 9 and 10 on the damage roll. Artifact weapons suffer no damage from being used with this Charm, but most mundane weapons are destroyed. An Essence 5+ repurchase unlocks two additional effects that can be used in conjunction with other Charms. Exploding Armor Strike: When the Dragon-Blooded lands a decisive attack enhanced by this Charm against an enemy whose armor has been weakened by ArmorPiercing Fang (p. 275), she can detonate the embedded weapons for five motes each, adding three bonus dice of damage for each additional explosion. Rain of Falling Stars: When the Dragon-Blooded uses Thousand Razor Wind, she may reflexively activate Exploding Weapon Technique as a Balanced Charm without needing to be in Fire Aura. Instead of this Charm’s usual effect, the first attack that hits detonates, adding three dice of decisive damage. She may detonate any subsequent attacks that hit for five motes each, with the same effect.
