*Once the Sidereal’s confessed her guilt, there’s no need for a lengthy trial; fate ensures she meets an appropriate sentence.*
Truthfully confessing a crime to a legitimate authority figure, the Sidereal vanishes and reappears within a prison, stockade, dungeon, or other place of confinement or punishment chosen by her within ({Essence + Charisma} x5) miles. She can bring her Circlemates and up to ([[Essence]] + 1) other willing characters, even if they aren’t present in the scene. They appear suitably restrained and surveilled upon arrival. The Sidereal’s player chooses three Secrets [[Charms]] or Secrets Maiden [[Charms]] she qualifies for that would aid in her purpose for imprisoning herself, gaining them until she escapes. Alternatively, she can grant those [[Charms]] to another qualifying Sidereal she brings as an accomplice. Once they escape, they can incur [[Experience Debt]] to learn the [[Charms]] permanently (p. XX). If magic would prevent entry, roll ([[Charisma]] + [[Larceny]]) against it, waiving the cost to reduce target numbers with [[Excellencies]], even if the effect normally can’t be contested. In that case, the effect’s creator makes an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll. Memories of the Sidereal’s disappearance are erased, while the memories of anyone involved in the chosen location are revised to account for the Sidereal having already been imprisoned there at the time of her confession, with a sentence dictated by her. This can be resisted with magic that specifically protects against memory-altering Psyche effects. The Sidereal can confess a violation of Heavenly law to any god or priest, imprisoning herself within any of Heaven’s gaols regardless of distance. Pursuant to the Yozi’s surrender oaths, she may travel to their prison in Malfeas without need for confession, though she must still travel five days through the Endless Desert to reach it. A record of the Sidereal’s confession appears in the inbox of Itzcalimon, God of Blackmail. 
## Reset
Once per story unless reset by violating a law that would subject the Sidereal to punishment severe enough to be a significant obstacle.
