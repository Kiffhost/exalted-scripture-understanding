*The Infernal has little patience for hesitation, wretchedly bored by enemies too slow to keep up with her.*

The Infernal can use this Charm at the beginning of a round if she’s within close range of an enemy. She takes her turn before all other characters. She must use that turn to attack him, but can flurry it with other actions. The only movement action she can take is to rush her target — or, if he’s able to move away from her, a reflexive move action to pursue him.

With Melee 5, Essence 3, the Infernal can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to add (Essence) dice of decisive or post-soak withering damage if she attacks an enemy whose Initiative is lower than hers.
## Reset
Once the Infernal uses this Charm against an enemy, she can’t use it against him for the rest of the scene unless she resets it by crashing him.
