The Sidereal spins gossamer filaments of fate into a net to bind otherworldly threat. The Sidereal rolls an unblockable (Dexterity + Lore) gambit against an enemy of fate within short range. The gambit’s difficulty is (target’s Essence). If successful, the Sidereal names a specific circumstance — “combat,” “negotiation,” “keeping secrets,” “courtship,” etc. While the bound enemy is in those circumstances, he suffers +1 target number on all rolls. Against un-Exalted targets, this lasts a year and a day; against Exalted, it lasts only one scene.
