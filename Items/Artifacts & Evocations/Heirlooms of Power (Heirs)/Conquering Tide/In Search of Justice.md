Conquering Tide yearns to carry its captain toward those who’ve thwarted justice. When the captain pursues a character whom she believes has committed a crime, the ship’s Speed Bonus increases by +1, and adds (higher of Essence or 3) non-Charm dice on rolls to navigate marine hazards between her and her quarry. If the crime she believes was committed opposes one of her Intimacies, Conquering Tide’s Speed Bonus increases by (Intimacy + 1) instead.

## Special activation rules
A Dragon-Blooded Peleps scion awakens this Evocation at no cost upon attuning to Conquering Tide.
## Resonant
Once per session, when the captain brings a criminal who’s played a significant part in the story to justice, she gains one Willpower. Additionally, when she sleeps aboard Conquering Tide, it whispers to her in dreams of foul deeds committed at sea. This information is rarely detailed, but sufficient to provide guidance on where to begin; the Storyteller should use this to provide plot hooks at whatever frequency best suits the game.
