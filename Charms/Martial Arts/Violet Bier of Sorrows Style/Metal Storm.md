*The martial artist strikes everywhere at once, leaving her victim nowhere to flee.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have Initiative 12+ and be within range to attack an enemy who has at least a −2 wound penalty. She gains Initiative equal to his wound penalty, maximum (lower of her Essence or 5). She then makes a decisive attack against him for each point of Initiative gained. If he has at least a −4 wound penalty, the attacks are undodgeable.
Successful attacks don’t reset the stylist’s Initiative.
Instead, after each attack, she loses Initiative equal to its damage roll’s successes, to a minimum of her base Initiative. Once all attacks have been completed, her Initiative resets as long as any of them hit.
### Terrestrial
The stylist can’t gain more than (lower of Essence or 3) Initiative or make more than that many attacks.
## Reset
Once per scene.
