A character can use a case scene action to search an area for anything of interest that might be hidden: an incriminating letter hidden in a vizier’s chambers, the concealed lever that disarms a First Age deathtrap, or a cache of contraband on a smuggler’s ship. The character’s player rolls (Perception + Investigation) as a dramatic action that takes fifteen minutes of searching. The base difficulty is determined by the Storyteller, and the conceal evidence action (p. 224) may be used to increase it. On a success, the character finds anything hidden.

The case scene action can also be used to uncover clues when pursuing a mystery or solving a crime. The character must actually be in a location relevant to his case in order to do so, and must have at least some idea of what he’s trying to find. A successful roll uncovers a piece of information at the site that will somehow advance the investigation, allowing him to proceed to a new scene. The Storyteller should narrate the character’s deductions, rather than just giving him the clue itself. Instead of telling a player “You find a smear of yellow mud,” tell him “You find a smear of yellow mud—whoever did this must have come from the docks!”
