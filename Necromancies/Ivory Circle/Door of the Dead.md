*The necromancer caresses a mirrored surface, looking through the reflection to the dark vistas of the Underworld beyond it.*
In a minute-long ritual, the necromancer transforms a reflective surface at least as large as she is into a passageway to the Underworld. It remains open for up to (Essence) minutes, allowing passage to and from the Underworld. The doorway opens to a safe Underworld location chosen by the Storyteller, based on where the necromancer cast the spell
- Near a shadowland, the doorway leads to an area close to the shadowland’s Underworld environs.
- Further afield in Creation, it leads to a nearby relevant afterlife — the cultural afterlife of a local people, a primal afterlife of bloody combat if cast on a battlefield, and so on.
- In other realms of existence, the location is entirely at the Storyteller’s discretion, often arriving on unfamiliar shores along the Sea of Shadows.
Once the portal closes, the reflective surface cannot be used again. Mirrors crack, water boils, and silver tarnishes irrevocably.
Alternatively, the necromancer may open a portal to a random destination within the Labyrinth without needing a mirror. She murmurs a discordant incantation to perform the ritual, slashing the air with a prepared blade. The fabric of Creation tears open to reveal a portal of shining darkness to a place of power within the Labyrinth’s confines. This portal only goes one way; she must leave the Labyrinth through her own power once she passes through.
## Control
Those who interact with the necromancer may sometimes experience disturbing visions or nightmares of their own burial thereafter. Additionally, by performing a funeral rite with the appropriate trappings, the necromancer may use this spell to cross into an afterlife she’s familiar with, disappearing to the Underworld from her tomb or pyre. Injuries sustained in this ritual, like being burned on a pyre, heal upon her arrival, though this doesn’t make the process any less painful.
## Distortion (5)
Distortion allows only a single subject to pass through the gateway before the spell ends. If one has already passed through, the spell terminates.
