This Evocation supplements a control roll when the Exalt initiates a grapple, adding ([[Essence]]) bonus dice. If [[Clutching Dragon Coil]] is used the turn after rushing an enemy with [[Wind-Rider Swiftness]], then that Evocationâ€™s bonus dice are added on both the [[Initiative]] roll and the control roll for the grapple.
