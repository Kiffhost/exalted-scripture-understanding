The Dragon-Blood lays down a line of salt or germinated grain to keep ghosts at bay (Exalted, p. 506), spanning up to a single range band. The aspect of this Charm depends onwhichsheuses—saltisEarth,whilegrainisWood.She rolls (Intelligence + Occult) to determine the power of the warding. Powerful ghosts who could normally cross the line by spending Willpower can only do so if their Resolve exceeds the Dragon-Blood’s successes on her Occult roll. Otherwise, they cannot cross the line. The line also repels other forms of undead, such as zombies or hungry ghosts.
