Stoking her audience’s passions, the Lunar incites overwhelming emotion. A successful inspire roll grants all affected characters a bonus die on all mental or social actions supported by the inspired emotion, but imposes a −3 penalty on mental or social rolls opposed by it. A warrior inspired with rage would gain a bonus on threaten rolls to intimidate foes or start fights, but suffer a penalty on influence rolls to negotiate his surrender.
