*Making the Lesser Sign of the Crow, the Sidereal calls forth a feathered spy to keep watch over a charge.*
The Sidereal creates a crow of violet stardust and sends it flying toward someone she can perceive, rolling (Perception + Awareness) against his Evasion. The Sidereal’s target is alerted by the sound of flapping wings, but the crow is otherwise imperceptible to mortal senses, inflicting the −2 surprise attack penalty on the target’s Evasion. Her target can use defensive Charms against this as though it were a decisive attack.
If the Sidereal succeeds, the crow vanishes into her target, nesting between the strands of his fate. While meditating, the Sidereal can observe the target, looking down from a perspective that’s directly above him. She can make Perception-based rolls with any Ability from this perspective and can use Charms and other magic normally to enhance such rolls.
Characters who can see the dematerialized or who are using magic like Tell-Tale Symphony (p. 277) can perceive the crow in flight when the Sidereal uses this Charm, and don’t suffer the surprise attack penalty.
The crow can’t be observed while dormant, but it can be perceived with the above magic while the Sidereal is watching through it. It has no substance, not even a dematerialized presence, rendering it impossible to harm or destroy without specialized magic. Those who see it merely know the Sidereal is watching.
