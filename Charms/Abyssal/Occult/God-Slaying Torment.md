*The Abyssal delivers a gospel of annihilation to those who think themselves beyond death.*
The Abyssal’s decisive attack deals aggravated damage to a spirit, and destroys it permanently if it incapacitates him.
If the Abyssal uses [[God-Slaying Torment]] with an [[Archery]], [[Brawl]], [[Martial Arts]], [[Melee]], or [[Thrown]] Charm that steals motes, she reduces that Charm’s cost by two [[Initiative]] and steals an additional mote.
Destroying a spirit grants (his Essence/) additional motes instead. These don’t count toward the maximum motes those [[Charms]] can steal.
