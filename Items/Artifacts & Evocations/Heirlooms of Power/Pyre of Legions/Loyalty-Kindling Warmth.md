*Pyre of Legionsâ€™ loyal soul empowers those that stand with their comrades, such that they may face a thousand foes as one.*
Withering attacks against battle groups ignore ([[Strength]]) points of soak; decisive attacks against them add ([[Strength]]) bonus dice on the attack roll. 

## Special activation rules

This Evocation awakens at no cost when attuned by a Dragon-Blooded Cathak scion. 

## Resonant

A character resonant with jade may pay an additional two motes to use this Evocation against an individual enemy with lower [[Initiative]].
