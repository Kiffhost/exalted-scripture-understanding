*The vizier can’t always be assured of her trusted disciples’ presence, but with deft improvisation and well-chosen words, she makes do.*
The stylist makes a ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Socialize) persuade roll against all bystanders and enemies, ignoring multiple target penalties, to sway them to her side. This is typically a life-changing task (Exalted, p. 216), but it may be only a serious task if the stylist and her allies seem likely to win the fight, or at least survive.
Enemies with negative Ties to their leader or cause treat them as one step stronger for this influence.
Trivial enemies and members of routed battle groups can be persuaded without needing a supporting Intimacy. Enemies who resist this influence with Willpower lose (stylist’s Essence + extra successes) Initiative, which she doesn’t gain.
Persuaded characters gain a Minor Tie of respect to the stylist and count as shadow fingers for the scene. Once the scene ends, if she’s able to take on more shadow fingers, she may choose to retain any of them who’re willing to continue on with her.
### Terrestrial
Enemies who resist with Willpower lose only (stylist’s Essence) Initiative.
## Reset
Once per scene.
