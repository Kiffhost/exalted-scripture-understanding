*Sidereals shape the future’s course through prophecies, utterances that echo through the weave of fate.*
A Sidereal prophecy can be thought of as a prediction that fate works to fulfill: 
<details><summary>Examples</summary>“The city will fall to an army bearing red banners.” “None who keep or trade slaves shall prosper here.” “You and your descendants shall have good health unto the seventh generation.” It exerts a subtle influence on fate, tweaking probabilities and nudging the odds to help make that prediction a reality.</details>

Each prophecy is based on a [[Constellations|constellation]]. [[Constellations]] whose thematic associations are clearly appropriate to the predicted outcome can always be used, but players can draw on other constellations that aren’t as directly on point if they incorporate its themes and trappings into their prophecy.
<details><summary>Example Constellation theming</summary>If a Sidereal prophesizes a city’s prosperity under the Banner’s auspices, the Sidereal might need to specify that it will be the city’s poets and their epic verse that will bring wealth.</details>
<details><summary>#advice/Storyteller</summary>These thematic associations are meant to help come up with interesting and narratively resonant prophecies, not to keep you from getting to play the game. Storytellers should be generous in giving players leeway here rather than stopping play to look up constellations. </details>

# Making a Prophecy
Making a prophecy uses the rules for [[sorcerous workings]] (Exalted, p. 483) meaning they act as an [[Action#Extended]] which [[Sorcerous Workings#^b4e125|must be attended to]] every [[Action#Extended#Interval|interval]] with the following changes:
- The [[Sidereal]] rolls ({[[Charisma]], [[Intelligence]], or [[Manipulation]]} + {[[Bureaucracy]], [[Linguistics]], [[Lore]], [[Occult]], or [[Performance]]}). 
- Instead of an [[Sorcerous Workings#Ambition|Ambition]] rating, prophecies have four [[#Ambition Factors]]: [[#Duration]], [[#Frequency]], [[#Power]], and [[#Scope]]. Their [[Action#Extended#Goal Number|goal number]] is ({total [[#Ambition Factors]]} ×5).
- The prophecy’s [[Action#Interval|interval]] depends on the rating of its highest [[#Ambition Factor]]: one hour for 1-2, one day for 3-4, or one week for 5.
- Prophecies don’t have [[Sorcerous Workings#Finesse|Finesse]]. The difficulty for each interval’s roll equals the rating of the prophecy’s highest [[#Ambition Factor]].
- Prophecies do not have Circles.
- Prophecies suffer complications on any failure, not just botches.
- Prophecies cost four [[Character Advancement#Experience Points|experience points]]. They’re refunded when the prophecy ends or becomes narratively irrelevant, [[Sorcerous Workings#^73813b|as usual]].
# Effect
A prophecy lets a Sidereal’s player impose −1 or +1 [[Dice Rolls#Target Number|target number]] (p. 154) on a roll made by a prophecy’s [[#target]] or in a targeted location if doing so helps fulfill her prediction. How often she can do so depends on the prophecy’s [[#Frequency]].
Prophecies also have narrative effects the Storyteller should take these into consideration in determining how their targets’ futures unfolded, also determined by [[#Frequency]].
# Target
Prophecies typically affect a person, group, community, or location, although the Storyteller may allow other targets if it makes sense. The number of characters or size of location a prophecy can target is determined by its [[#Scope]].
Note that prophecies may affect characters who don’t exist at the time of their utterance. If the number of targets ultimately exceeds what the prophecy’s Scope allows, any new targets beyond the limit aren’t affected.
To speak a prophecy, the Sidereal must have substantial interactions with its targets over the course of the extended action. She need not deal extensively with every target but must meaningfully engage with a group or location.
# Ambition Factors
Prophecies have four Ambition Factors: 
- [[#Duration]], how long they last; 
- [[#Frequency]], how often their effect manifests;
- [[#Power]], how strong of characters they can affect; 
- [[#Scope]], how many targets they can affect.
Ordinarily, no Ambition Factor can exceed (higher of [[Essence]] or 3), and the total can’t exceed ({[[Essence]] ×2} + 5). The Sidereal adds +1 to the maximum rating of individual Ambition Factors and +5 to the maximum total rating for prophecies of her [[Sidereal#birth sign]] or [[Sidereal#Exaltation sign]] (p. 113).
## Duration
A prophecy’s Duration determines how long it lasts. Note that when the duration elapses, its experience point cost is refunded.

| Rating | Duration      |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 1      | One month     |
| 2      | One season    |
| 3      | One year      |
| 4      | One century   |
| 5      | One millenium |
## Frequency
A prophecy’s Frequency determines how often its target number manipulation applies.

| Rating | Frequency of [[Dice Rolls#Target Number\|TN]] change | Narrative effect (changes and events that have-)                                                                                                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | Once per story                                       | Small effect without meaningful, lasting impacts.                                                                                                      |
| 2      | Once per session                                     | Meaningful, lasting impacts on individuals’ lives but only small impacts on a community or location as a whole.                                        |
| 3      | Once per day                                         | Major impact on individuals and small groups. Communities and locations are meaningfully affected, but it won’t significantly change their status quo. |
| 4      | Once per scene                                       | Massive and life-altering for individuals and small groups, significant impact on communities and locations.                                           |
| 5      | Whenever appropriate                                 | Major changes to the status quo of everything encompassed by the prophecy’s Scope, and potentially beyond it.                                          |
A prophecy’s Frequency also provides a default for how significant a prophecy’s offscreen narrative effects will be. These typically vary depending on how many people that particular narrative effect impacts. These are only suggestions, though. The Storyteller always determines the destiny’s actual consequences.
### Examples of narrative effects
#### Frequency 1
Someone chances across enough money to last them a short while. Tea sold by a merchant blessed to prosper becomes popular among the
Imperial City’s intellectuals.
#### Frequency 2
A mother miraculously survives a difficult labor. A village’s inhabitants form a superstition that snakes bring good luck, leading some to attempt domestication.
#### Frequency 3
What should have been a bad harvest yields enough to survive the winter.
The slave trade becomes much less profitable in a city, causing many merchants to prioritize other markets.
#### Frequency 4
A wandering swordsman’s string of defeats convinces him to become a pacifist. A small, vulnerable city-state successfully repels a siege from a much stronger force.
#### Frequency 5
A formerly peaceful city-state launches a campaign of aggressive expansion. A principality’s people rise in open revolution against their ruler.
## Power
The higher a prophecy’s Power, the more puissant characters it’s capable of affecting. The higher a character’s
Essence rating, the more Power is needed to target them with a prophecy.
The Exalted are harder to affect with prophecy than other supernatural beings. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this may also apply to especially powerful beings like Deathlords, behemoths, and the like.

| RATING | MAXIMUM ESSENCE (UN-EXALTED) | MAXIMUM ESSENCE (EXALTED) |
|-|-|-|
|1| Mortals and trivial characters only| —|
|2| (Sidereal’s Essence)| —|
|3| (Sidereal’s Essence + 2)| (Sidereal’s Essence)|
|4| All characters| (Sidereal’s Essence + 2)| 
|5| All characters| All characters|
## Scope
A prophecy’s Scope determines how many people or how large a region it can affect.

|Rating|Scope|
|-|-|
|1| A group of up to 10 people, a single household|
|2| A group of up to 25 people, a small hamlet, a few households|
|3| A group of up to 100 people, a village|
|4| A group of up to 1,000 people, a town, a neighborhood of a city|
|5| A group of up to 10,000 people, a small city, a district of a large city|
## Means
Prophecies use the following Means rather than those available for sorcerous workings.
### Cooperation
The assistance of fellow [[Sidereal]] or of a supernatural being whose powers are thematically related to the prophecy adds +1 [[Action#Terminus|terminus]]. A larger group of cooperating [[Sidereal|Sidereals]] — more than a single Circle — add +2 [[Action#Terminus|terminus]].
### Cosignatories
The signature of another [[Sidereal]] or a god of the [[Bureau of Destiny]] on a memorandum notifying the Bureau of the prophecy adds +1 [[Action#Terminus|terminus]]. This differs from [[#Cooperation]] in that a cosignatory lends political influence to smooth out bureaucratic complications to a prophecy rather than aiding in making the prophecy itself. An [[Essence]] 6+ cosignatory adds +2 [[Action#Terminus|terminus]].
### Extra Time
The [[Sidereal]] can increase the prophecy’s [[Action#Interval|interval]] — hours, days, weeks, months, seasons, years — by up to three steps, adding +1 [[Action#Terminus|terminus]] for each.
### Trappings
If the [[Sidereal]] wears or displays at least three of the appropriate [[Constellations|constellation]]’s trappings (p. 134) for the entirety of making the prophecy, she adds +1 [[Action#Terminus|terminus]].
## Complications
If the [[Sidereal]] fails an [[Action#Extended|interval]] roll, her prophecy suffers a complication from those below. If she fails to complete it before its [[Action#Terminus|terminus]] expires, she suffers an additional complication.
### Anomalous Backlash
A flaw in the prophecy strains and tears reality, with consequences that ripple throughout the weave of fate. These can be inoffensive and deniable, like a string of outrageously improbable coincidences, but they can also be dangerous, like loosing an unbound Second Circle demon in [[Creation]] or creating a bordermarch or shadowland that engulfs a building. Even harmless anomalies can interfere with the fulfillment of destiny; [[Sidereal|Sidereals]] responsible for creating them are expected to ensure this doesn’t happen.
### Audits
The Sidereal’s prophecy incurs political retaliation in the form of an audit. She’s haled before one of [[Yu-Shan]]’s censors and must defend herself against criminal charges, real or fabricated. This might involve [[social influence]], using [[Investigation]] to uncover exculpatory evidence, using [[Lore]] to introduce relevant loopholes, etc. If she and her Circle can’t convince the censor of her innocence, she’s assigned a burdensome mission or duty or suffers severe fines or a demotion.
### Competing Agendas
Prominent figures in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] have goals that conflict with the prophecy and take steps to thwart it. Usually, this means a member of a destiny planning committee proposing a planned destiny that conflicts with the prophecy’s outcome, forcing the [[Sidereal]] to sway the rest of the committee to avoid coming into conflict with destiny. Alternatively, another [[Sidereal]] might make a prophecy of his own that opposes her prediction.
### Paradox Spirits
Reality splinters and fractures around the [[Sidereal]], birthing a malevolent paradox spirit. Paradox spirits are alien creatures of color and shadow, intertwined with fate’s weave and with the prophecy from which they were born. A few share certain qualities of their [[Sidereal]] “parent,” drawing its colors from her anima’s hues, wearing a warped semblance of her face, speaking with her voice, or sharing her memories. Paradox spirits seek to fulfill the prophecy they were born from, but their methods are unpredictable, amoral, and likely to cause significant problems for the [[Sidereal]]. A paradox spirit’s Essence equals the [[Sidereal]]’s. It has whatever other traits the Storyteller assigns it, which can include [[Sidereal]] [[Charms]].
### Getimian Interference
This complication can only come into play if the [[Sidereal]]’s already suffered an anomalous backlash or created a [[#paradox spirit]]. A Getimian antagonist seeks to leverage this weakness in the weave of fate to empower his reality-warping magic, infecting the world with his Origin on a large scale. Other powerful adversaries might have reasons of their own for leveraging flaws in fate.
