*Virtually unknown outside of the East, each [[skycutter]] is fashioned from a single two-foot piece of metal alloyed with one of the five magical materials, hammered or carved according to precise geomantic angles that focus [[Essence]] along its cutting edge.*
Unlike conventional [[War Boomerang|boomerangs]], a thrown [[skycutter]] almost always returns to its master’s hand—only if the wielder botches her attack roll does the weapon need retrieving.
