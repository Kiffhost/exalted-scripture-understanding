Picking the perfect moment to strike, the Solar winds a killing flow of [[Essence]] around her blade and hurls it from the depths of her heart. To use this Charm, the Exalt must succeed at an ambush (p. 203) and launch a decisive attack against her target. [[Falling Icicle Strike]] doubles successes on the damage roll.
