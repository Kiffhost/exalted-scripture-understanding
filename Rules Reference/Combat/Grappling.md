Grapples are initiated through a [[Attack#Gambit#Grapple|grapple gambit]]. Upon succeeding at the [[Attack#Gambit|gambit]], the grappler makes a [[#control roll]], which determines how long she can keep the grapple locked on. These *rounds of control* are used to take further actions within the grapple.

While grappling or being grappled, both characters suffer a -2 penalty to their [[Defense]] and cannot perform [[Flurry|flurries]]. Victims caught in a grapple cannot take [[Movement]] actions, and suffer a -1 penalty to all attacks, or a -3 penalty to all attacks using [[Item Tags#Two-Handed|two-handed]] weapons.

Each time the grappler suffers an [[Attack]] and/or damage from any source, she forfeits 1 *round of control* of the grapple. Even if the attack misses, 1 *round of control* is lost. An attack which does damage causes a total of 2 *rounds of control* to be lost.

During each [[Time#Turn|turn]] in which the grappler maintains the clinch, including the turn on which she initiates it, she must choose to apply one of the following effects: she may [[#Savage]] the opponent, [[#Restrain/Drag|Restrain or Drag]] him, or [[#Throw/Slam]] him. She may also [[#Release]] him at any time. She can take no other movement or combat actions so long as the grapple persists. 
# control roll
This is an opposed ([[Strength]] + {Brawl or Martial Arts}) roll between the grappler and her target. Should the target win or [[Intimacy|tie]], then the target escapes the grapple on his next turn. Should the martial artist win, she gains control of the grapple during her current turn, and for a number of additional *rounds of control* equal to the number of successes by which she beat her target. After those turns elapse, the grappled target automatically escapes the grapple. A grapple will also immediately end if the grappler suffers [[Initiative#Crash]]. 
## Rounds of control
Rounds of control are a unique resource to [[grappling]] characters, they decrease by one each round, or can be expended to [[#Savage]], [[#Throw/Slam]] or [[#Restrain/Drag]] the grappled character.
# Savage
The grappler injures her opponent, choking him, wrenching his limbs, stretching his joints, or bashing him into nearby scenery. The savage action applies [[Attack#withering|withering]] or [[Attack#decisive|decisive]] damage to the grappled opponent without chance of failure or opportunity for defense. If the grappler chooses to inflict withering damage, she makes an [[Unarmed]] [[Attack#hit roll|hit roll]] against [[Defense]] 0 for the purpose of determining extra damage. Again, this attack hits the opponent automatically, even if the character generates 0 successes on the attack roll. With a decisive attack, no attack roll is necessary—just roll [[Initiative]], apply damage, and reset to base as usual. 
# Restrain/Drag
This action uses up 2 *rounds of control*, and can’t be used if the victim wins the [[#control roll]]. The attacker locks the victim up in an immobilizing hold. This inflicts no damage, but prevents the victim from taking any action at all on his next turn. 

While restraining her opponent, the character may take a movement action, and in doing so, drag the victim with her. This might be used for abductions, to haul a target out from behind cover, or perhaps even to drag an individual into an area that is harmful to the victim but harmless to the attacker (such as a [[Water Aspect]] Dragon-Blooded pulling an opponent into a river to drown him). 
# Throw/Slam
The grappler ends the clinch prematurely, slamming the victim into the ground or a nearby surface within close range. This inflicts damage in the same fashion as [[#Savage|savaging]] the opponent, with the following difference: 

[[Attack#withering|Withering]] [[Attack#damage roll|damage roll dice pool]] gains a +2 bonus per *round of control* forfeited by ending the clinch prematurely, to a maximum of [[Strength]] *rounds of control*.

[[Attack#decisive|Decisive]] damage roll dice pool gains a +1 bonus per *round of control* forfeited by ending the clinch prematurely, to a maximum of [[Strength]] *rounds of control*.

The opponent is left [[Prone]] by this maneuver. Any number *rounds of control* over the grappler's strength are simply lost with no benefit. Decisive slams normally inflict [[Health Track#Bashing|bashing damage]] but can inflict [[Health Track#Lethal|lethal damage]] if the chosen impact point is particularly deadly (such as into a bonfire, or onto a spike). 
# Release
The attacker simply releases the clinched victim without harming her. Release is a [[Action#Reflexive]] rather than a [[Action#Combat]], and may be performed at any time. 
# A final note
Characters cannot grapple any opponent where a grapple simply doesn’t make sense given the relative scales involved (so grapples would be inapplicable against an army of a hundred Realm legionnaires, or against the [[Mask of Winters]]’s corpse-fortress Juggernaut; likewise, a toddler can’t effectively grapple a grown man, nor could a grown man grapple an eight-ton tyrant lizard).
# Engage
[[Battle Group]]s cannot grapple. Instead they may Engage, a [[Combat Action]] in which the battle group swarms the target, encircles him, or otherwise pins him down with force of numbers. Engage works the same way as a [[Attack#Grapple|grapple]], with the following exception: no [[Initiative]] roll is required to confirm the action (the [[Attack#Gambit]] automatically succeeds, deducting an appropriate [[Initiative]] cost), [[#Savage|savaging]] and [[#control roll]]s use the group’s standard armament and combat Ability rather than [[Unarmed]] attacks, and the [[#Restrain/Drag]] and [[#Throw/Slam]] options aren’t available. Engage is primarily useful for pinning an enemy in place and preventing [[Movement]].
