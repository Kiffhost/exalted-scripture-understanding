*The signature finishing move of Mantis style is a deadly barrage of hundreds of blows in a matter of seconds.*
To use this Charm, the stylist must have Initiative 15+ while controlling a grapple. She releases the clinch, then rolls a single unblockable, undodgeable decisive attack to represent the flurry of blows. Each round of control she gave up by releasing the grapple adds +3 dice of decisive damage and increases its onslaught penalty by −1.
## Reset
This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by crashing a grappled foe whose Initiative was higher than the stylist’s. 
## Mastery
If the stylist incapacitates her victim, she adds (rounds of control expended / 2, rounded up) to her base Initiative upon resetting. 
## Terrestrial
The martial artist cannot benefit from more than (Essence) rounds of released control.
