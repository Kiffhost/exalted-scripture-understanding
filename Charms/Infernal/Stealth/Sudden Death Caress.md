*The Infernal is never farther than a blink away.*

The Infernal can use this Charm after successfully establishing concealment against all enemies with a Stealth roll. She chooses an enemy within medium range and instantly dashes into close range with him, without needing another Stealth roll to maintain concealment. This uses her movement action.

While using [[Faster Than Sight]], the Infernal can waive this Charm’s Willpower cost once per scene.
## [[Keys]]
#### Drifting Murder Wind
This Charm’s range increases to long. The Infernal dissolves into crimson wind as she moves, letting her bypass obstacles and barriers through only the slightest of openings.
#### Lurking Monster Revelation
If the Infernal has concealment against all enemies, she can use this Charm reflexively on her turn. It still uses her movement action.
#### Senseless Murder Advent
The Infernal can reflexively make a decisive attack against her target upon entering close range.
