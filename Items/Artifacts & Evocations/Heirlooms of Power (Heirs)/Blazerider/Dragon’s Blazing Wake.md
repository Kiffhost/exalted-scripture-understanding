Blazerider ignites a swath of smoldering destruction across the battlefield, raining fire down upon its master’s enemies. To use this Evocation, the wielder must be at least short range above the ground or a similar surface. She can use it to enhance either a decisive attack or a move action, igniting a trail of flames behind [[Blazerider]] that descends from the sky for five motes, plus one [[Initiative]] for each range band [[Blazerider]] moves as part of the supplemented action. This is a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 4 and Damage ([[Essence]])L. It spans the entire length of Blazerider’s movement, is wide enough to encompass only a single character, and descends all the way down to the ground, or similar surface. This always includes the target of an enhanced attack. Any flammable objects in the hazard catch fire and burn until the end of the scene, with the above hazard traits.
A Dragon-Blood with the [[Essence]] 3 repurchase of BellowsPumping Stride may use it to enhance this Evocation, paying three motes and expending her Fire Aura to increase the hazard’s traits to difficulty 5 and Damage 5L.
## Dissonant
This Evocation can’t enhance attacks beyond short range, or movement that crosses multiple range bands.
