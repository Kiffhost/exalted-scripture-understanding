As the wielder prays to Mars to sanctify her duel, shining red stars add the constellation of the Spear, governing the terms of battle, to the astrological etchings of Strife’s Crucible, charging it with the weight of destiny. She may use this Evocation to consecrate the rules of any duel or terms of engagement for a battle that she agrees to. If either she or her chosen opponent breaks the sanctified rules, the blades glow an unearthly red as destiny imposes a punishment fitting to the crime, as though they’d broken an oath sealed by the Eclipse Caste anima power (Exalted, p. 176). At the very least, the curse for breaking the oath makes it impossible for the cheater to legitimately win the duel. If the wielder wins a battle sanctified by this Evocation, she gains two points of Willpower and rolls (her opponent’s Essence), losing one point of Limit for each success. If she is defeated, she draws inspiration from the fight, gaining a Major Intimacy to reflect the lessons she learned from it, as well as a single Charm or Evocation that reflects this Intimacy. She must meet all prerequisites of the effect she learns, but need not spend experience points on it. She must maintain the Intimacy at Major intensity or stronger, or else lose that Charm. Once she’s learned a Charm using Terms of the Spear, she must pay its experience point cost to learn it permanently before she can learn another one from a defeat. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by achieving a major character or story goal (Exalted, p. 170) thanks to the help of a past opponent or an enemy’s change of heart. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset it.
