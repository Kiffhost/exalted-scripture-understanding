Under the Sidereal’s subtle ministrations, those whom she brings together are never far from each other’s hearts. The Sidereal makes a special (Charisma + Linguistics) instill roll against two or more characters, each of whom must have a positive Tie to each other target. She may do so verbally or through a written message sent to each recipient. Affected characters can only weaken these Ties voluntarily after a scene in which a Tie’s object mistreats or offends them. These Ties can be reduced to Minor intensity, but can’t be fully removed by any means. Affected characters can and must reject Psyche effect that would erase their memories of a Tie’s object or cast them in a worse light as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220). Resisting this Psyche effect requires spending three Willpower each day over (Sidereal’s Essence) days.
