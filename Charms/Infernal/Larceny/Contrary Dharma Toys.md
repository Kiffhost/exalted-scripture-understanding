*The Infernal strips away delusions of meaning and value, exposing petty trinkets and worldly pleasures for the shameful trifles there are.*

The Infernal makes a difficulty 4 (Manipulation + Larceny) roll to steal the meaning from a mundane object with a touch. If the player of the object’s owner of creator objects to this, the difficulty increases to (character’s Essence + 3). She can use Charms that enhance pickpocketing on this roll.

Success strips away the semblance of any emotions involved in the object’s creation. They’re revealed to the Infernal, including any of its creator’s relevant Intimacies. While the object’s appearance doesn’t change, any meaning that it was meant to express or convey is either muted entirely or twisted into self-parody: heartfelt artwork seems cynical, a poem seems trite, a handmade gift seems thoughtless. Any semblance of use, value, or significance is likewise stripped away, making evidence seem useless or coins seem like forgeries.

Any roll to examine or appraise the meaning, value, or use of an affected object must beat the Infernal’s successes. Otherwise, the object appears truly meaningless and worthless. For more casual examination, characters a (Perception + {Awareness, Investigation, or other appropriate Ability}) opposing half the Infernal’s successes, rounded up, to recognize that the object might have some meaning or value they haven’t noticed.

This Charm can be used on written messages or other objects that convey social influence, making their message seem thoughtless, unoriginal, or plagiarized. The Infernal’s roll must beat the influence roll’s successes if they’re higher than the roll’s base difficulty. Doing so subtracts one success from the object’s influence, plus an additional success for every two extra successes the Infernal rolls. This doesn’t apply to Psyche effects.

This Charm’s effects can be undone by magic capable of impossible repairs, like [[Crack-Mending Technique]] (Exalted, p. 295), in addition to magic that undoes Shaping effects.
