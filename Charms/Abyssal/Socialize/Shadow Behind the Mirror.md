*Captivated by an exquisite soul, the Abyssal becomes her victim’s shadow.*
The Abyssal can pay a one-mote, one-[[Willpower]] surcharge when she uses [[Passion-and-Obsession Puppet]] to warp her personality into a reflection of her target. She gains a Major Tie of fascination, not a Minor one, but all of her other Intimacies are suppressed, as if she didn’t have them.
In place of her own Intimacies, the Abyssal gains all of her target’s Intimacies of which she is aware, and the [[Storyteller]] informs her player of how many unknown Intimacies the target has. She may guess at them a number of times equal to the total number of unknown Intimacies, as if using Merciless Dissecting Stare’s repurchase.
The deathknight adds ([[Essence]]) automatic successes on [[Larceny]] rolls to disguise herself as her and influence rolls with any Ability to pass herself off as him or keep up the pretense. She also gains +([[Essence]]) [[Guile]] against effects that would contradict such impersonation.
