With a gesture, the Solar uplifts a favored follower and grants him true power. This Charm permanently empowers a character under the effect of [[Underling-Promoting Touch]], granting him a personal [[Essence]] pool of four motes plus up to five more, provided by the Solar upon using this Charm. The character becomes inured to supernatural terror, and may resist it with a +2 bonus to his [[Resolve]]. In addition, if the character has [[Integrity]] 3+, then he’s granted a Charm called [[Unhesitating Dedication]]. This Charm allows the prophet to defend a Defining Principle from being decayed by reflexively paying three motes. The Lawgiver may have ([[Essence]] x2) prophets. If a prophet is slain, the Solar recovers experience points spent in the Charm’s cost.
