The Exaltâ€™s hands flow with the Essence of a thousand craftsmen; her urge is legion and her well is bottomless. When she creates a superior or legendary slot, she may use this Charm to greatly speed her efforts to begin the project (p. 239). This may be represented as the Exalt thinking, planning, and working with impossible speed. Though it cannot dictate the speed at which she gathers materials or performs tasks not directly associated with Craft, this Charm guarantees that given all such materials are provided, and all such tasks have been completed, the design and forging work that comes before she can roll to finish takes no longer than (6 - Essence) months for N/A and five dot Artifacts, and no more than (6 Essence) weeks for all else.
