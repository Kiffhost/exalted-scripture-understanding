The full moon, the new moon, and every phase in between are all the same moon, each a different aspect of Luna’s glory lighting the night sky. It’s with this protean potential, inchoate and manifold, that Luna blesses [[Casteless]] Lunars. Theirs is the freedom to discover who they truly are, and to decide who they’ll be. 

Every Lunar is [[Casteless]] when she Exalts. Some are found swiftly by the Silver Pact and receive the moonsilver tattoos that let them define their caste. For them, Castelessness is a brief and transitory period, though still a meaningful one.

Others remain [[Casteless]] much longer, even until the end of their lives, embracing it as their true nature. Some go undiscovered by the Silver Pact or refuse its envoys’ entreaties. Others forgo the chance to take on the moonsilver tattoos, wishing to reflect fully on their innermost nature before making a decision that will be forever written on their souls. Some simply refuse the choice, dissatisfied with the threefold roles of warrior, trickster, or witch. 

The prowess of [[Casteless]] Lunars isn’t defined by any archetype; all can attain excellence in whatever endeavors they devote themselves to. Lacking the focus of a Caste, they cultivate wider breadths of talent with greater ease.

# Spirit Shapes

The [[Casteless]] show no tendency toward any spirit shape. 

# Anima Banner

[[Casteless]] Lunars’ Caste Marks are inconstant, shifting with the moon’s phases. Their anima banners are chaotic swirls of blues, purples, silvers and whites, growing more vibrant and intermingled as their intensity rises. Their iconic animas can display a wide variety of manifestations; for some, this changes after they’re tattooed and choose a Caste. 

# Anima Effects

Shifting and unconstrained, the Casteless’ animas ease their transformations. They can also call upon the Lunar Castes’ anima powers, transitioning between the moon’s phases (p. XX). 
- At dim anima, the cost of shifting into human shapes is discounted by two motes.
- At bonfire anima, the cost of shifting into animal shapes is discounted by two motes. This doesn’t apply to [[Charms]] like [[Towering Beast Form]] or [[Emerald Grasshopper Form]].
- Once per day, she may use the once-per-day power of any Lunar Caste. She can’t use it again until she’s used the powers of all three Castes, or the session ends — e.g., a [[Casteless]] who uses the [[Full Moon]] power must use the [[Changing Moon]] and [[No Moon]] powers before she can use the [[Full Moon]] power again that session.

# Caste Attributes

The [[Casteless]] lack Caste Attributes but have greater aptitude at mastering unfavored Attributes. 

# Experience Trigger

Overcoming a significant enemy or obstacle in a way that reveals something new about the character or leads her to learn something about herself; advancing or protecting a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] by completing a sacred hunt; removing a major impediment to her or her Circle’s goals through shapeshifting; protecting a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] to an institution or community in which she’s made a place for herself.
