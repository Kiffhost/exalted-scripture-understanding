The Solar imbues her chosen weapon with Essence, to feel its every angle and weight as part of her body. Its strike becomes an extension of her will. The Solar’s accuracy is calculated as if it was made from close range, regardless of the distance from which she is throwing. If Precision of the Striking Raptor is used at close range, the target’s defense is lowered by one. This Charm does not allow the Exalt to strike a target beyond the range of her weaponry.
