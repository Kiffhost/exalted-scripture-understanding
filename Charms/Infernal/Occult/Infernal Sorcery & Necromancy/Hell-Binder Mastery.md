*Demons summoned into the Infernal’s service cannot deny their rightful prince, bound by chains of brass and duty.*

The Infernal gains the following benefits:
- She doubles 9s on rolls to bind demons.
- Successfully binding a demon refunds one point of Willpower spent on the spell. The Infernal also gains this refund if she summons a Second or Third Circle demon and chooses not to bind it.
- The Infernal adds (Occult) non-Charm dice on read intentions rolls against her sorcerously-bound demons — they have no secrets from her.
- When the Infernal binds a demon, she may mark it as hers. Anyone who sees it is and is familiar with the Infernal recognizes her as its binder.
