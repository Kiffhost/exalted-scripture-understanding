*Nothing matters.*
The Abyssal makes a special instill roll against a single character, either spoken or written, to corrupt one of his Minor or Major Principles. She must leverage an Intimacy of at least the same intensity as the one targeted.
If successful, the Abyssal may rewrite the targeted Principle, warping it in a way that expresses the futility of life, the value of death, the inevitability of the end, or similar bleak beliefs. This costs three Willpower to resist.
This Charm can affect Defining Principles if their object is mortal or if the target shares a Major or Defining Principle with the Abyssal.
## Reset
This Charm can’t be used against a character more than once per story.
