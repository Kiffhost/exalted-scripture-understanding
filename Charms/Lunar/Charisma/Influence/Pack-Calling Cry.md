*The Lunar’s primal call summons wild beasts.*
She beckons to her side an animal of a species whose heart’s blood she possesses. This Charm costs an additional [[Willpower]] if used to call an animal that qualifies as a three-dot familiar (Exalted, p. 161), and requires a ([[Charisma]] + {Presence or Survival}) roll against its [[Resolve]]. It arrives with preternatural speed — in that scene, unless the Storyteller deems this implausible. If no members of that species are nearby, the Storyteller may have a similar animal answer instead. Once the animal arrives, the Lunar may instruct it to carry out one inconvenient or serious task (Exalted, p. 216) without needing an influence roll. Animals that qualify as three-dot familiars can only be given an inconvenient task without rolling. Depending on how it’s treated, the animal may remain with the Lunar or retreat into the wild after completing the task.
