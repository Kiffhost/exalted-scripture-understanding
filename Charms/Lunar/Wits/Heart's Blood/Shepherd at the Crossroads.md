A creature of boundaries and crossroads, the Lunar guides others on transformative journeys.
The Lunar guides a character through a transfiguration or metamorphosis, assigning him a quest or task that will set him on the road to change. That character’s player must consent to the transformation, although the character needn’t do so. The more extensive the transformation, the more onerous the task that must be fulfilled:  
- Transformations that could at least notionally be accomplished by mundane means and that don’t hold great personal significance to the questant require an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216). *Examples include changing hair color, repositioning a crooked tooth, or causing a character’s skin to tan.*
 - Mundane transformations that have great personal significance to the questant and supernatural transformations on the level of what a Terrestrial Circle working could accomplish (Exalted, p. 485) require a serious task. *Examples include physically transitioning genders, making someone grow significantly taller, or turning a mortal into a bear.*
 - Supernatural transformations on the level of what a Celestial Circle working could accomplish require a life-defining task. This can also include transformations that completely change the nature of a supernatural being, which normally requires a Solar Circle working. *Examples include undoing a decade or two of aging, turning a demon into a god, or turning a raksha into a human.*
Upon the quest’s completion, the questant undergoes the chosen transformation as a shaping effect. Sometimes this is sudden and spectacular; sometimes, it is subtle, the culmination of a gradual metamorphosis the questant didn’t even realize had begun. If the transformation conveys mutations, improves the questant’s Attributes, or the like, the questant incurs experience debt.
The Lunar, in turn, gains the questant’s heart’s blood upon the completion of his quest. If the quest supported one of her Major or Defining Intimacies, she also loses a point of Limit.
