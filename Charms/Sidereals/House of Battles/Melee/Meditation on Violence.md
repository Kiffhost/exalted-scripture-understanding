Calm and precision envelop the Sidereal as she strikes. The Sidereal ignores up to ([[Perception]]) in penalties on an attack roll for one mote per point of penalty. If she reduces an attackâ€™s penalty to zero (or there was no penalty to begin with), she may add up to (Perception/2) dice of post-soak withering damage or decisive damage for a further one mote each.
