*With words as subtle as shadow, the deathknight inscribes secret orders upon her victim’s heart.*
The Abyssal makes a special ({Charisma or Manipulation} + Presence) influence roll against one character, manifesting her Caste Mark as she does. The target’s Intimacies don’t modify his Resolve against this roll. If successful, the target is briefly entranced.
During this time, the Abyssal can embed instructions in his subconscious, consisting of up to (1 + extra successes) short, clear statements.
Once the Abyssal’s finished, the target’s trance ends, and he immediately begins following them unless the deathknight included an instruction to wait. He doesn’t understand why he does these things, nor does he consciously remember what his orders are.
Resisting this influence costs three Willpower. However, a character who does so forgets that the Abyssal attempted to use this Charm. A character who successfully asserts her Resolve against this influence or resists it is rendered immune for (his base Resolve) days.
