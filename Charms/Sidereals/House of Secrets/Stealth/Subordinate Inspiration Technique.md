Whispering from the shadows, the Sidereal bends those around her to her will. The Sidereal need not speak to make a Manipulation-based influence roll from concealment with any Ability from concealment against a single target. Her target hears her words as if they were his own thoughts, suffering −2 Resolve. If her roll fails, he rolls (Perception + Integrity) opposing it. Success reveals that someone’s attempting to tamper with his thoughts, but not who. The Sidereal’s never perceived as the source of this influence.
