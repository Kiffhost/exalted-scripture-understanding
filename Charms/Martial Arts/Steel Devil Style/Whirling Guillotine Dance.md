The Steel Devil enters the stance of 108 Sharp Deaths. In his mind, he sees angles of incoming attacks that havenâ€™t even been launched yet, and every jugular lies exposed. Entering this form combines the effects of both Steel Devil Form and Dual-Slaying Stance. 

## Mastery

The Steel Devil may reflexively enter this stance upon crashing someone with Double Attack Technique or one of its variants, and gains one point to his current Charge as well as his Offhand Charge capacity.
