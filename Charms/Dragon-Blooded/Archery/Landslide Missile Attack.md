*The Dragon-Blood wreathes her arrow in earthen [[Essence]], building momentous force as she aims, then releasing it to strike like a rolling boulder.*
This Charm can only enhance a decisive attack that benefits from aiming. An enemy hit by it is knocked back one range band. If this movement leaves him on an earthen surface, he also falls prone as the Dragon-Bloodâ€™s arrow seeks to return to the earth.
