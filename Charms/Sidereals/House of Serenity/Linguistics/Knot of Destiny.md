*The Sidereal speaks with a sibilance that reminds quarreling lovers or bickering siblings of all the good their bond has brought them, mending even the most tattered threads of fate.*
The Sidereal chooses a relationship — romantic, familial, business, or otherwise — between characters present in the scene. Addressing one or more characters involved in it, she subtly shifts its emotional dynamic. Those involved in the relationship count as having a Minor [[Intimacy|Tie]] of respect to each other person in it (even those not present). Any negative Ties they have to each other are treated as one step weaker. The Sidereal is never perceived as the source of this. 
The Sidereal can expand the range of emotional contexts she can impose by purchasing the below for three experience points or one bonus point each. She must apply the same emotional context to all targets. 
- Fascination, particularly for the details of a character’s history, his day-to-day doings, and his personal and business relationships. 
- Friendly competition. This competition is expressed in whatever venue best fits the relationship’s nature. 
- Infatuation. This applies only if everyone in the relationship is romantically compatible. If a player opts out via the Red Rule (Exalted, p. 222), the [[Intimacy|Tie]] is instead one of respect, both for his character and for other targets interacting with him. 
- Willingness to deal in good faith — in business transactions, legal affairs, negotiations, etc. 
With a [[Linguistics]] 5, [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Sidereal can pay one mote per character and one [[Willpower]] to selectively choose which contexts she imposes on each character, including the option to change contexts reflexively mid-scene.
