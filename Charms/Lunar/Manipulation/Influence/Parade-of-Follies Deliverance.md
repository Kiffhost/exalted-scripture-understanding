*The Lunar reveals secret paths to freedom, even if they lead through the gates of madness.*
She makes a special ([[Manipulation]] + [[Presence]]) persuade roll, which doesnâ€™t require a supporting [[Intimacy]], against a character under the influence of a Psyche effect or mind-affecting curse, using the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221). If successful, her target enters a [[Decision Points|Decision Point]] and must invoke either a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] that opposes the Psyche effect or curse, or a positive Major or Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] to the Lunar (or her current human shape) to pay one [[Willpower]]. If he does, the Lunar adds a condition to the compelled course of action, as per [[Commanded to Fly]]. If the Lunar uses this Charm on her Solar mate, she succeeds without needing a roll. He may reflexively form a positive Major [[Intimacy|Tie]] toward her in the [[Decision Points|Decision Point]]. This Charm can only be used on a character once per story. Guile
