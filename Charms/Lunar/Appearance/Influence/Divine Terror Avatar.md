Amonsterbornofnightmares,theLunarstrikesfeareven into the hearts of the enemies of the gods. Characters withTiesoffeartowardher(orhercurrentshape)aswell as trivial opponents can’t attack or make threaten rolls againsther.Incombat,theylosetwoInitiative(whichshe doesn’t gain) at the end of any turn in which they don’t move away from her. If most of a battle group’s members have a [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear toward her, it suffers a –([[Intimacy]]) penalty on rout checks made while it can see her. This can be resisted by entering a Decision Point and invoking an [[Intimacy]] of equal or greater intensity than the [[Intimacy|Tie]] of fear and spending one [[Willpower]]. Characters can’t do so while crashed. This Charm’s [[Willpower]] cost is waived if [[Perfect Fear Scent]] is active.
