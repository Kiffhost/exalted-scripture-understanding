The Dragon-Bloodâ€™s focus quells the wind that would divert her arrow, ensuring her shot flies true. She extends the range of a withering or decisive attack by one range band, maximum long (including those made with Flame weapons), and ignores penalties from wind or inclement weather. If her weapon already has long range, she instead adds an automatic success on the attack roll.
