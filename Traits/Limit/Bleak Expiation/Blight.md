A Blight taints the world with death’s Essence, corrupting natural things with the touch of rot, entropy, and decay. 
## Minor Blight
Minor Blights are eerie and unnerving, but can’t cause anything more than superficial harm. Their effects are limited to the Abyssal’s immediate presence — out to long range in combat. Ongoing effects last for one day unless otherwise specified. Examples include:
- Food spoils or crumbles to ash.
- Temperatures fall rapidly.
- Flames are snuffed out.
- Nearby vegetation wilts, and grass dies when the Abyssal walks over it.
- Standing water freezes.
- A chill wind follows in the Abyssal’s wake.
- Shadows lengthen and grow darker.
## Major Blights
Major Blights have a larger scope, capable of affecting a large town or a significant portion of a city. It can inflict meaningful harm or destruction, comparable to what mundane dangers or calamities might cause. They last one session unless otherwise specified.
- Crops wither and cattle are born stillborn in large numbers for the next season.
- A sudden thunderstorm fills the sky, raining down tears and crackling with black lighting.
- Corpses rise as ravenous zombies, remaining animated until the next sunrise.
- Insects, vermin, and other small animals die en masse. 
## Defining Blights
