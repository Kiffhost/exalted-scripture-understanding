Hardness is a static value trait gained from [[Charms]] or magical armour. It represents some degree of supernatural invulnerability.

[[Hardness]] offers protection from [[Attack#decisive|decisive attacks]]; it has no use against [[Attack#withering|withering attacks]].

If a decisive attack’s damage dice pool is equal to or lower than the target’s [[Hardness]], the decisive attack can’t inflict damage, though it is still considered a successful attack. If the dice pool is higher than the target's [[Hardness]], [[Hardness]] has no effect.

[[Hardness]] from multiple sources does not stack unless a source explicitly states otherwise. Instead, simply use the best [[Hardness]] value.
