*The Wood Dragon lives so that all may live.*
To use this Charm, the Immaculate must have [[Initiative]] 12+. 
*She lays hands on another character, activating pressure points with gentle touches as verdant [[Essence]] flows from her hands to suffuse his body and heal his wounds.* 
She rolls ([[Initiative]]), healing her ally one level of non-aggravated damage for each success, to a maximum of (his [[Stamina]] + [[Resistance]]) levels. She suffers an unpreventable level of bashing damage for every two health levels she heals this way, rounded down. Using this Charm resets the Immaculate to base [[Initiative]]. 
If she expends her Wood Aura, she only loses [[Initiative]] equal to the total levels of damage healed, to a minimum of her base [[Initiative]]. 
A character can only benefit from this Charm once per day.
