*The Dragon-Blood fires a volley of arrows skyward, each one doubling and redoubling to unleash a descending storm of death.*
They hang fixed at the apex of their arc for a moment before falling in a storm of flashing blue streaks of light. To use this Charm, she must spend two consecutive turns aiming and maintain her [[Initiative]] at 12+ throughout. She targets a point within her weapon’s range, and rolls a single undodgeable decisive attack against all characters within short range of it, even allies. Each enemy hit suffers the Dragon-Blood’s full [[Initiative]] in damage dice. Battle groups instead take levels of damage equal to her [[Initiative]]. This Charm can only be used once per scene.
