*Gnomon twists the skeins of time around those it strikes, entangling them with the past.*
This Evocation allows Gnomon’s wielder to make a decisive attack using either [[Melee]] or [[Martial Arts]] against an enemy whose [[Initiative]] is lower than hers. Every level of decisive damage she deals delays her victim’s turn this round by a single tick. Dropping an opponent to tick 0 causes him to lose this turn for the round entirely. This Evocation cannot be used against the same target twice in two consecutive turns. 

## Resonant

Waive this Evocation’s [[Willpower]] cost if used during the frozen time of [[Step Between Seconds]].
