*The necromancer taints her victim’s soul with a resonance that violently clashes with the spiritual timbre of Creation. His appearance grows shadowed, his eyes white and wide, his flesh burning under the sun’s light. Only darkness offers relief.*
The necromancer twists the soul of a target within short range, rolling (Intelligence + Occult) against the victim’s Resolve. Success renders him a creature of darkness and causes him to suffer a −1 penalty to all rolls while in Creation from the disharmony in his soul. In direct sunlight, this penalty worsens to −3, and the victim’s flesh begins to burn, inflicting a die of aggravated damage for each minute of exposure, ignoring Hardness. If his skin is concealed completely, he takes damage each hour instead. Damage caused by sunlight doesn’t heal naturally. These effects are suppressed in the Underworld and in shadowlands.
The necromancer may end this curse by reaching into the target’s chest, drawing it out as a squirming organ of shadow, and crushing it. It also ends if she’s slain.
## Control
The necromancer may sense the direction and distance to her victim, adding (his Essence) non-Charm dice on rolls to track him. She may also reflexively suppress the curse’s effects at will, allowing her to use it as leverage when threatening her target. The sun’s light feels unpleasant on the necromancer’s skin.
If she isn’t already a creature of darkness, she becomes one.
## Distortion (15)
Distortion must occur within short range of the target. Success relieves the effect for (distorting necromancer’s Essence) days.
