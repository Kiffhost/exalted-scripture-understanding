Blade in hand, the Exalt moves with Serenâ€™s cautious grace, alert to every threat. While Wise Steel Form is active, the wielder adds +1 to her Parry and adds (Essence) bonus dice on disengage actions and rolls to contest rush actions. She waives the Initiative cost for disengage actions, and gains one Initiative whenever she successfully disengages or contests a rush action. 

## Special activation rules

Whenever the wielder uses the reflexive movement granted by a successful disengage to move toward an ally toward whom she has a positive Major or Defining Tie, she may reflexively activate Wise Steel Form. 
## Terrestrial

The wielder must still pay the Initiative cost of disengaging.
