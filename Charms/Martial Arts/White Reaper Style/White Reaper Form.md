The martial artist rears up into a grim and terrifying battle posture, regarding her opponents as little more than grass to be scythed down before her. She receives double 10s on all decisive damage rolls and can easily fight large groups single-handedly, treating the Drill of any battle group she attacks as one step lower for calculating their Defense bonus. Groups that already have poor Drill instead take an additional -1 Defense against her attacks. She may also move through the space filled by a battle group without needing to spend Initiative. More spectacularly, whenever the White Reaper incapacitates or crashes a non-trivial enemy, a halo of sizzling, silver-white Essence surges around her like a second skin. Damaging a battle group also grants her a halo. The martial artist may have up to (higher of 2 or her Essence rating) in halos, up to a maximum of five, with each one adding +1 to her Resolve. 

## Special activation rules

Whenever the martial artist begins her turn in close range of three or more non-trivial opponents, or in the space filled by a battle group, she may reflexively activate White Reaper Form.
