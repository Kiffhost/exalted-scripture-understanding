*The Abyssalâ€™s phantasmal grasp reaches through the veil to seize her prize.*
The deathknight doubles 9s on a roll to pickpocket or steal an item, and can call stolen items to her hand from up to ([[Essence]] x3) feet away, or short range in combat. Such objects vanish instantly into her hand without crossing the space between them, undeterred by any obstacles.
