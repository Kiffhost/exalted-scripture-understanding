# [[Air Dragon Style]]
To practice Air Dragon style is to be the wind: elusive, intangible, omnipresent, and devastating in its fury. Its students train in acrobatics to cultivate an intuitive awareness of their body’s own movements, and master breath control to lighten the body and walk silently. Unlike the other Immaculate styles, Air Dragon stylists strike from afar, throwing [[Chakram|chakrams]] to claim their foes’ heads.
## Weapons
Air Dragon unarmed attacks are chops and spinning kicks. They also use the [[chakram]], which can either be thrown as a ranged weapon or wielded at [[Range|close range]] as a light weapon. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced by Air Dragon [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage. 
## Armour
This style is compatible with light armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Occult]] is used for battling spirits, while [[Dodge]] and [[Stealth]] are used to evade and outmaneuver foes.
