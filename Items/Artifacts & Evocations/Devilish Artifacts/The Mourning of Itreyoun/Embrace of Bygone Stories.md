*“It is our duty to share the memory as best we can with those who will never understand.”*

When attacked by an enemy within medium range who can see her, the wearer counterattacks with an (Appearance + {Performance or Presence}) inspire roll to fill her attacker with fascination or melancholy. If she succeeds, he must take a miscellaneous action on his next turn to stare at the robe’s embroidery, which may be flurried. This costs one Willpower and two Initiative to resist.

If the wearer uses [[Forgotten Woven Dreams]] and the attack misses her, that Evocation’s penalty also applies to the attacker’s Resolve against this influence.
### Resonant
The wearer can use [[Tale-Teller’s Fading Memorial]] reflexively with this Evocation, combining both Evocations’ influence in one roll.
