The Sidereal entrusts her secrets to nothingness. The Sidereal seals away her own memories. She chooses which memories to suppress, but the Storyteller may require a ([[Manipulation]] + [[Stealth]]) roll for extensive or complex manipulations, like suppressing the last twenty years or selectively editing her memories of a Circlemate to suppress anything that could reveal he’s a double agent. The Sidereal’s memory of using this Charm is always suppressed. Most magic is incapable of viewing or accessing the sealed memories, those specialized [[Charms]] like [[Soul Projection Method]] (Exalted, p. 358). The Sidereal can use this Charm after a roll against her [[Guile]] or any other roll to which its effect is relevant, letting her negate its effect if she suppresses whatever memories are necessary to do so. Alternatively, the Sidereal can use this Charm after she succumbs to a Psyche effect that creates false memories or alters existing ones, rolling ([[Manipulation]] + [[Stealth]]) opposing the Psyche effect’s roll — or an appropriate (Attribute + Ability) roll, if it’s unrolled. Success erases any implanted false memories or any alterations that add new details to existing memories. If the Sidereal’s presented with convincing evidence that her memory’s been erased, she can use this Charm a second time to unseal suppressed memories. If the only evidence is another character telling her she used this Charm, he must roll as if overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221) and the Sidereal must cite a Major or Defining [[Intimacy]] in the [[Decision Points|Decision Point]].
