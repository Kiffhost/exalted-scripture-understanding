*The Terrestrial’s attention falls on thieves and cowards like a lead weight dropping into one’s stomach. She may use this as an Earth Charm when she rolls to oppose a character’s [[Traits/Abilities/Stealth]], or as a Water Charm against a disguise.*
She subtracts one success either from the total successes of the opposing character’s concealment as the crushing weight of earth pins him down, or from his disguise successes as the pounding force of the tide washes away his facade. In Earth or Water Aura, using the appropriate elemental variant strips an additional success from the opposing character for every two threshold successes the Dragon-Blood rolls.
