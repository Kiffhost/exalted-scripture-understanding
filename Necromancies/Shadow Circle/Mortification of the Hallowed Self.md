*In an act of self-flagellation, the necromancer partially fuses with her higher and lower souls, suffusing her anima or corpus with pulsing spiritual gore.*
The necromancer’s spiritually charged flesh allows her to perceive and interact with dematerialized characters.
Magic that would already allow her to do so instead adds one non-Charm success on rolls to detect or attack them.
She may spend five motes to partially dematerialize until the start of her next turn, inflicting a −(Essence) penalty on physical actions taken against her unless they’re enhanced by appropriate magic and allowing her to pass through porous surfaces like grated gates or barred windows.
She gains further benefits depending on which half of her soul is currently in prominence and may switch between them reflexively at the start of her turn
- While her higher soul dominates, she increases the Resolve bonus of Intimacies that aren’t based on emotion by 1. When she successfully applies her Resolve against influence that leverages one of her emotion-based Intimacies, the character who attempted it falls prone to his knees, cowed by the spiritual pressure of her rebuke. Ghosts of her Essence or lower are forced into a full kowtow and can’t rise from prone until the end of her next turn.
- While her lower soul dominates, she increases the Resolve bonus from Intimacies of primal emotion (p. XX) by one. She ignores up to (Stamina) points of penalties from wounds, poison, sickness, and other bodily afflictions and converts them to nonCharm bonus dice on influence rolls involving fear, hunger, or reckless passion.
## Control
The necromancer’s scarred soul twitches inside of her, warning her when she perceives a character with Shaping magic that could reshape her body or soul. She rolls (Perception + Occult) against his Guile, learning the power’s general nature if she succeeds. She may suffer penalties if the target is purposefully disguising or veiling his powers.
## Distortion (10)
The necromancer’s souls are goaded into warring with one another. She cannot benefit from either until she centers herself with a (Wits + Integrity) roll against (distorting necromancer’s Essence), and even then suffers a −2 penalty on her next turn from sheer spiritual disequilibrium.
### Special
This spell can only be cast by a necromancer with both higher and lower souls, leaving it the provenance of the Exalted.
