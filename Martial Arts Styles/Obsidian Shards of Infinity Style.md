# [[Obsidian Shards of Infinity Style]]
One morning, as the philosopher-assassin Ei Zou trimmed his whiskers while waiting for his tea to steep, he saw himself in his mirror and was enlightened. He had no words with which to express his understanding of the infinite; rather, his teaching was shaped like a knife. This is Obsidian Shards of Infinity style. It is a contemplation of the interplay of choice and possibility, of reality and its reflections. It is thus a killer’s art, for every decision murders countless futures.
The only way to learn this style is to face one of its practitioners; no student or victim of Ei Zou has ever surpassed him in that. Students cultivate insight, imagination, and [[Essence]] by contemplating koans, navigating mirror-filled labyrinths, and undergoing prolonged sensory deprivation. They must be ever vigilant, for their teacher might attack at any time. Some Sidereals follow Ei Zou’s practice of ambushing those in whom he saw potential, conferring enlightenment with a knife’s edge. 
In battle, the Obsidian Shards stylist breathes with a steady rhythm, is constantly aware of all possible angles of attack, and makes no unnecessary movement. Every mirror is a weapon to them; thus, they keep their blades well-polished and choose the sites of their ambushes wisely.
## Weapons
This style emphasizes knifehand strikes, often delivered two handed; rapid successions of kicks; and joint locks. It’s compatible with [[Khatar|khatars]], [[sai]], and [[Knife|knives]], which are traditionally dual wielded. [[Unarmed]] attacks enhanced with this style’s [[Charms]] can be stunted to deal lethal damage 
## Armour
This style is incompatible with armor. 
## Complementary Abilities
[[Stealth]] is a significant part of this style, befitting its creator. 
## Nature
Still.
