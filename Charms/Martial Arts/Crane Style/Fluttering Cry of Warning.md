*The sheltering wings of the Crane stylist shield her allies from the aggression of their enemies.* 
[[Fluttering Cry of Warning]] adds +2 [[Defense|Parry]] whenever the martial artist parries an attack directed at an ally protected by one of her defend other actions until her next turn. Additionally, an enemy who overcomes the Crane stylistâ€™s [[Defense|Parry]] and chooses to attack her ward rather than the martial artist must pay a point of [[Initiative]] to do so. 
## Mastery
[[Fluttering Cry of Warning]] allows the martial artist to take a defend other action reflexively, even if it is not her turn.
