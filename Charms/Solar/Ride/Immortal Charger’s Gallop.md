Feeding Essence through her mount’s form, the Exalt greatly increases its speed for an instant. Convert the mount’s Speed Bonus to automatic successes on a single movement action or one interval of a race. If the mount has a negative Speed Bonus, this Charm reverts it 0. This Charm does not affect the penalty to a mount’s mobility that comes from heavy barding.
