Grasping at Mist (Essence 2; Ground-Denying
Defense): The Lunar can use Ground-Denying Defense and Foot-Trapping Counter to oppose the
movement of dematerialized enemies and magical
transportation, like the spell Travel Without Words.
Stone-Shattering Rampage (Essence 2; Ferocious Biting Tooth, Surging Thew Technique): An
attack also counts as a feat of demolition to destroy
and bypass an enemyâ€™s cover.
Dream-Devouring Monstrosity (Essence 3;
Nightmare Scar Memento, Stalking Nightmare
Hunter): The Lunar haunts the dreams of someone
affected by Nightmare Scar Memento.
Ogre's Hostage Brutality (Essence 3; Foe-Hammer Technique, Jaws of the River Dragon): While
grappling, the Lunar clashes an attack using her
clinched foe. If she succeeds, the opposing attack
is redirected to the grappled foe and becomes unblockable and undodgeable.
