*The Infernal is a living weapon of unimaginable destruction, an apotheosis of violence.*

The Infernal empowers one of her limbs, chosen when she purchases this Charm. It may undergo a monstrous transformation— scales and talons, grotesquely swollen muscle, living basalt inlaid with brass — though this isn’t necessary. This can be represented by purchasing mutations together with this Charm. The Infernal can go into experience debt for this if necessary. If the Infernal has [[Slavering Horror Maw]], she can choose to enhance her fangs instead of a limb.

The empowered limb uses the traits of a heavy artifact weapon (ACC +1, DMG +14, DEF +0, OVW 5), but only for Brawl attacks. It’s immune to any crippling effect less severe than total amputation — and even then, the limb will regrow after five days.

When the Infernal uses [[Infernal Monster Awakened]], she can pay a thirteen-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to spread spiralling whorls of emerald flame across her arm, spelling out the Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden. She gains the following benefits on attacks with the chosen limb:
- She rerolls up to (Strength) dice that roll failures on withering and decisive damage rolls.
- She adds (Strength/2, rounded up) to the Overwhelming value of her withering attacks and the Initiative bonus she receives for crashing enemies with them.
- Her decisive attacks ignore Hardness. When a successful attack resets her Initiative, she adds (Strength/2, rounded up) to her base Initiative.
- She can use [[Fists of the Old Ones]] reflexively after a decisive damage roll.
- [[Infernal Monster Awakened]] impedes all forms of divination and scrying magic, even that of the Sidereal Exalted. This extends out to (Strength) miles.

If the Infernal has bonus dots of Strength from [[Infernal Monster Awakened]], they’re included in the above calculations.
