*The Lawgiver is the embodiment of order.*
With her knowledge and will, chaos is cast asunder. Through use of this Charm, the Exalt may fix her notice on any object, structure, or character (including herself) at the moment it is first affected by the twisting power of the Wyld. The Solar’s solid knowledge flows out in a rush of [[Essence]], sluicing away the Wyld’s influence. In addition, roll ({the Solar’s Mental Attribute} + [[Lore]]) with ([[Essence]]) non-Charm bonus dice, with a difficulty based on the source of the warping, with the bordermarches being difficulty 3 and the deep Wyld being difficulty 5. Any extra successes on this roll equates to a number of turns (in combat) or minutes (out of combat) for which the target of WyldDispelling Prana becomes immune to further twisting. This Charm may affect a character at up to medium range, and requires multiple uses to protect objects or structures larger than a horse. 

## Special activation rules

After using this Charm once in a scene, the Solar does not need to pay to use it again unless she fails the subsequent [[Lore]] roll; she may continue to direct sluicing bolts of [[Essence]] at targets for free, until the subsequent [[Lore]] roll fails to produce any successes.
