*The Dragon-Blood ingratiates herself into insular cliques, foreign courts, and barbarian tribes with skillful understanding of their customs and mores.*
After spending at least an hour being exposed to any culture or social group, she may gain a temporary [[Socialize]] specialty in it. She may have up to ([[Essence]]) specialties granted by this Charm at a time. If she wishes to gain a new temporary specialty while at the maximum, she must abandon an old one.
