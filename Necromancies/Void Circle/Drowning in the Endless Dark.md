*With a single note that resonates as if from beneath the skin of the world, the necromancer sings of the Sea of Shadows as it once was and draws it forth to drown the land.*
Omens of a terrible flood surge at a point within ([[Essence]]) miles over the course of an hour before a torrent of tenebrous water erupts from the ground. This flood is a one-time environmental hazard with difficulty 5 and Damage 4L. Characters who fail to resist are swept into the riptide or drawn under and will drown unless rescued. Structures suffer far more damage at the Storyteller’s discretion, up to uncountable damage.
The waters extend for ([[Essence]]) miles in all directions, granting those farthest from the necromancer up to a few minutes to prepare for the oncoming deluge. Characters who fall beneath the surface find it magically bottomless, sinking two range bands deeper per turn unless they succeed at a difficulty 4 ([[Strength]] + [[Athletics]]) roll to tread water. When cast at sea, the dark waters extend down a full mile.
Anyone lost for more than (their [[Essence]]) rounds beneath the waters is lost to the Sea of Shadows, reappearing at a point in the Underworld of the Storyteller’s choosing.
The necromancer knows whenever a character drowns as a result, and may send their soul to Lethe directly or raise them as a ghost under her control, imposing a Defining Tie of obedience. At the spell’s end, the waters recede at last, and anything that was submerged is lost forever. Structures beneath the water line are stripped bare — houses become blasted skeletons of sea-logged driftwood, bottom floors of great towers become precarious frameworks of scoured stone, and ground is left clear of anything other than smooth pebbles and withering scrubgrass.
## Control
If she is within range of the flood, the necromancer may raise a vessel of bone and bloody silk to carry her safely upon the waves, scooping up ([[Essence]] x 20) other characters of her choice. This vessel uses the attributes for a blue-water merchant ship (Exalted, p. 246). If she knows [[Black Water Odyssey]] (p. XX), she may instead summon a ship she’s claimed from the Underworld. She is forever sodden by the tides of the Underworld; ghosts and spirits associated with water count as having a Minor Tie of fear, hopelessness, or respect to her, based on their temperament, but she also suffers a −2 penalty to disguise herself or cover her tracks on dry land.
## Distortion (15)
A rival caster may create a hollow within the spell’s effects out to long range, diverting the dark waters around and depositing any characters drowning within that range, no matter how deep they are.
