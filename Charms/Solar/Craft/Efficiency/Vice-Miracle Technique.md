The Solar crafter is constantly giving form to the wonders that live inside her mind. A Lawgiver with this Charm is particularly fecund: once per season she may produce a completely finished two dot Artifact of the player’s choosing (or design). The Solar need not pay gold points to complete the project; the Artifact is already complete; the Storyteller should treat this as a piece of work she designed and completed in the margins of all her other projects, using expertise and efficiency to complete a wonder as an unspoken side project. The Solar earns no craft points for producing Artifacts in such a manner. However, if the player produces this Artifact in response to a problem, a question, or otherwise introduces their new invention as part of a socially-driven stunt that makes their character seem like a miraculous wonder-worker, she earns five gold points. At Essence 5+, this Charm can be used to produce a two or three dot Artifact. Special Activation Rules: This Charm can only be used by a character who has already constructed at least one Artifact rated two or higher, and is in the process of building at least one other.
