The Lawgiver fires an arrow that courses with burning [[Essence]], streaking down like a falling star to explode at her enemy’s feet. This attack is a difficulty 3 gambit that requires no aim action. However, if the Exalt aims before using the Charm, she may act first on the next round, regardless of her place in the [[Initiative]] order. If another character uses magic to act first on the same round, compare their [[Initiative]] to determine order of actions. The [[Initiative]] roll on this gambit is made with double 9s. If successful, it blasts the target out of position, forcing him to act (2 + extra successes on the gambit’s [[Initiative]] roll) ticks later than he would have. If [[Searing Sunfire Interdiction]] drops the target to a tick of 0 or less, he loses his turn for the round. [[Searing Sunfire Interdiction]] cannot be used on the same target twice consecutively. An [[Essence]] 3+ repurchase of this Charm lowers the difficulty of the gambit to 2 and waives the [[Initiative]] cost upon success. An [[Essence]] 4+ repurchase of the upgraded Charm resets the Solar’s attack if she drops an opponent from a higher [[Initiative]] tick to a lower [[Initiative]] tick than her own. An [[Essence]] 5+ repurchase of the second upgrade allows the Solar to use [[Searing Sunfire Interdiction]] twice consecutively on the same target, dropping the [[Willpower]] cost from the second shot. If the Solar delays her opponent with both shots, he’s also forced backwards a range band, even if this would force him off a cliff or a rooftop. An [[Essence]] 6+ repurchase of the previous upgrade allows the Lawgiver to use this gambit repeatedly against a single target: each time she successfully hits with this gambit, she may immediately fire the gambit again, so long as she has ammunition. If she misses or forces her target to lose a turn, the Charm ends. As with the previous upgrade, waive the willpower cost from all but the first shot. If the Solar stops an opponent from acting, award her a point of [[Willpower]]. As above, for every two shots the opponent is delayed, he’s forced back a range band. An [[Essence]] 6+ repurchase of the previous upgrade allows the Solar to immediately target a new opponent with the above effect upon dropping another opponent to tick 0 or lower with [[Searing Sunfire Interdiction]].
