*The Lunar seems an unkillable monster, regrowing severed limbs and maimed organs. Can such a beast even die?*
[[Maimed But Unbroken]] can now heal [[Crippling]] effects that involve the total amputation or destruction of limbs or organs. It can also heal crippling effects that don’t inflict a penalty, doing so after one interval of (7 – [[Stamina]]) rounds or one scene outside of combat.
