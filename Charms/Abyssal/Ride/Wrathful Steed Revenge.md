*Slavering for the flesh of the fallen, the deathknightâ€™s mount turns its hunger on those who would strike its rider.*
While riding a mount rolled into battle with [[Flesh-Eating Steed Frenzy]], the Abyssal may have it makes a decisive counterattack against an enemy who attacks either it or the deathknight.
With an [[Essence]] 3 repurchase, the Abyssal may pay a one-[[Willpower]] surcharge to have her mount make a clash attack instead.
