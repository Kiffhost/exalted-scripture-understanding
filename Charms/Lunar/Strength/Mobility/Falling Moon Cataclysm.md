*Mighty Behemoth Leap The Lunar leaps across the sky with a mighty bound that craters the earth beneath her, descending on her foes with world-shattering force.*
When the Lunar uses [[Mighty Behemoth Leap]], she may use [[Behemoth’s Footprint Tread]] reflexively, waiving its [[Willpower]] cost. Rather than striking her foes with a weapon, she unleashes an earth-shaking shockwave as she leaps, rendering the attack unblockable. This doesn’t reset her [[Initiative]].
The force of the shockwave propels the Lunar an additional range band horizontally or two range bands vertically as she leaps. Upon landing, she can repeat Behemoth’s Footprint Tread’s attack, waiving its cost.
This takes the place of Mighty Behemoth Leap’s normal attack and opposed roll to knock foes prone.
Once the Lunar lands and makes any attacks, her [[Initiative]] resets, as long as she hit at least one enemy.

## Protean 
In animal shapes with Trample, the Lunar receives Mighty Behemoth Leap’s Protean benefit if she uses [[Behemoth’s Footprint Tread]].
