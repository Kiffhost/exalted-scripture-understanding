*Adapting to whatever obstacle lies before her, the Lunar taps unexpected sources of strength.*
When she stunts to add a second Attribute to the amount of bonus dice she can add on a feat of strength and applies a full Excellency, she adds that Attribute to her base [[Strength]] to determine if she may attempt the feat. 
## Protean 

In animal shapes whose effective [[Strength]] rating for attempting feats is lower than the Lunar’s, she uses her [[Strength]] instead.
