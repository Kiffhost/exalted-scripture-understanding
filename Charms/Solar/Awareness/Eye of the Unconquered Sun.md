Solars are the legacy of the Unconquered Sun. It is their destiny to see the world through this age of darkness. When this Charm is used, the Solar’s Caste Mark blazes like a tiny sun, cancelling any Essence-muting magic the Solar may be using, and removing her from stealth. Eyes blazing white, Caste Mark burning, her gaze shines a wide beam of light across everything she searches, twin lamps moving over the terrain out to long range. Everything caught in her stare is subject to the following effects: 

- All magical and mundane Stealth effects are cancelled. Solid walls and other opaque objects grow transparent as the Lawgiver’s gaze passes over them, rendering all forms of Stealth automatically unsuccessful. 
- Fog lifts, smoke parts, and clouds dissolve under the Solar’s intense focus. 
- Dematerialized spirits are forced to materialize, at full cost of the Materialize Charm, or as much of the cost as they can pay. 
- All disguise magic is stripped. Mundane disguises tatter and melt away. 
- Shapeshifters are forced back into natural form, resplendent destinies are temporarily forced into dormancy, personas (p. 400) are suppressed, and other innate or native transformative magics of the Exalted are similarly deactivated. 

The only way to avoid Eye of the Unconquered Sun is to successfully dodge the Solar’s gaze by applying Evasion against the Solar’s Awareness roll. The Solar’s Awareness roll is enhanced by (Essence) dice, and any 1s rolled are rerolled until 1s fail to appear. Every character within long range of the Solar who fails to dodge when she uses Eye of the Unconquered Sun is subject to the above effects. The range of this Charm is extended to extreme range by Unsurpassed Sight Discipline, however, this Charm does not depend on eyesight and may be learned and employed by a blind Exalt. Anyone spotted by Eye of the Unconquered Sun automatically knows it; a bright white glare piercing through a fortress wall or an airship hull is impossible to miss.
