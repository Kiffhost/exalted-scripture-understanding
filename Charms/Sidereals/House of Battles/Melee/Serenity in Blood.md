*Stirring the currents of fate with her weapon’s tip, the Sidereal severs the paths of fate that lead to her being struck.*
An attack against the Sidereal’s Parry suffers +1 target number. She can block unblockable attacks. Successfully blocking causes her attacker to lose one Initiative for each die that is a failure instead of a success because of its increased target number, maximum (Sidereal’s Essence).
With a Melee 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Sidereal may pay a one-Willpower surcharge once per scene to inflict +2 target number. Uncountable damage is negated completely; she becomes immune to a recurring source of uncountable damage for the scene. This resets once the Sidereal parries three decisive attacks from nontrivial enemies.
