The sorcerer shapes a small, six-winged messenger spirit to convey her words to another character. The spirit flies withimmensespeed,capableofcrossinghundredsofmiles in an hour or all Creation in less than a day—only the boundaries between realms of existence will stop it from delivering its missive. Upon arrival, the cherub is visible onlytoitsintendedtarget,towhomitcandeliveramessage of up to five minutes in length before dissipating. Sorcerers canconveysocialinfluencethroughtheInfallibleMessenger, but cannot normally use their Charms to enhance the roll. A sorcerer who knows Infallible Messenger as her control spell may pay an additional point of Willpower to project her senses through the cherub’s own, allowing her to use Awareness and Investigation Charms while delivering the missive. Having this spell as her control will also cause a number of tells to begin manifesting in the sorcerer’s vicinity, even when the spell has not been cast. It may appear in murals or paintings that she owns, carven amongst the gargoyles of her residence, or briefly fluttering in the periphery of a mirror’s reflection.
