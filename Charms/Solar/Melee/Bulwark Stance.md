The Solar’s mastery of defensive Essence flows guides her weapon to intercept all blows. Until her next turn, the Lawgiver ignores all penalties to her Parry Defense. The Chosen’s definitive guard dampens her foes’ strikes. Any damage roll made against the Solar takes a -1 penalty for each 1 rolled on the attack roll, up to a maximum of the Solar’s Essence rating.
