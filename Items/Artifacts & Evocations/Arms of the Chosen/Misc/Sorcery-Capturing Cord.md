Dots: 4
---
These slender, yard-long ropes are threaded with orichalcum and moonsilver, giving them wondrous strength and resilience. A sorcerer standing in a non-ritual sorcery spell’s path may bind the spell’s Essence in a knot, trapping it until the knot is released. The bearer must be initiated into the circle of the spell to be captured, and must succeed on a reflexive (Dexterity + Occult) roll against the enemy sorcerer’s spellcasting roll. If successful, the spell is swallowed by the knot like water down a drain. 

Untying a knot unleashes the stored spell as though shaping it normally, using ([the lower of Dexterity or Intelligence] + Occult). If she attempts to a shape a spell of a circle she isn’t initiated into, it is distorted or botches — Storyteller’s choice. 

A sorcery-capturing cord can hold a single spell. Looking at a pre-existing knot, one can determine the captured spell’s circle with a difficulty 3 (Intelligence + Occult) roll, and the specific spell with (Circle x 2) threshold successes. All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight and similar Charms reveal this information automatically. Destroying the cord releases a distorted or botched version of the stored spell in a random direction.
