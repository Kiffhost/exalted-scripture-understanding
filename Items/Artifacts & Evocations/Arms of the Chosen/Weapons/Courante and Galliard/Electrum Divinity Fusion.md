Celestial Union of Blades The Exalt and her sword-sibling have mastered the art of union; transcendent, they become one. To activate [[Electrum Divinity Fusion]], both characters must have unlocked this Evocation and be at 10+ [[Initiative]]. Only one character must use her action to activate this Evocation, but both must pay its cost. The characters dissolve into their animas and flow together, incarnating as a ten-foottall, four-armed, gold-and-silver warrior that physically resembles both characters. This has the following effects: 
- Each character retains her own separate [[Initiative]] total, [[Essence]] pool, and [[Willpower]]. Whenever a character’s [[Initiative]] comes up in turn order, the composite being may act, effectively allowing that charactertotakeheractionfortheround.However, any roll she makes uses the highest Attribute and Ability ratings of either character, and she may access any [[Charms]], [[Evocations]], spells, or similar effects known by her sword-sibling, even if she doesn’t meet prerequisites or minimums. 
- The wielders still treat each other as swordsiblings when they use [[Evocations]] to enhance their separate actions. Each sword-sibling can take defend other actions to interpose her own Parry rating against all withering attacks directed against the sword-sibling’s [[Initiative]] track and any decisive attacks against the composite. 
- Each character retains her own health track and all levels of damage in it, but these are temporarily put aside. The composite has its own health track, using the highest number of health levels possessed by either member of the merger plus four −1 levels and four −2 levels. If the composite is reduced to its incapacitated health level, then all damage in its health track is divided among the health tracks of the characters included in it as they separate (round down). 
- An enemy that makes a withering attack against the composite chooses which sword-sibling’s [[Initiative]] track he targets with the attack. If either character is crashed, the composite immediately dissolves, both members falling prone. Half of the damage in the composite’s health track, rounded down, is transferred to each character’s health track. 
- [[Courante and Galliard]] fuse into an enormous electrum blade, shrouded in many-colored light, that sings as it cuts through the air, with the stats of a moonsilver grand daiklave (Heavy: +1 ACC, +14 DMG, +0 DEF, OVW 6; Tags: Lethal, [[Melee]], Reaching, Two-Handed). Other artifacts wielded by either of the merged characters combine into a single composite weapon and/ or armor with the most advantageous traits of each individual artifact. These generally take the form of spectacular, exotic weapons or armor that combine the most striking features of each character’s panoply. 
- Ongoing effects such as active [[Charms]], astrological blessings, poisoning, or so forth that applied to either character apply to the composite being. 
- The Storyteller may adjudicate other effects of the merger—suchaswhetheronememberofthefusion might gain [[Limit]] from the other’s [[Limit]] trigger, or whether either member can keep secrets from the other — at his discretion, preferably choosing for whatever outcome makes for a better story. This Evocation can only be used once per story, unless reset by upholding a Defining [[Intimacy|Tie]] towards one’s swordsibling by making a significant sacrifice to protect them.
