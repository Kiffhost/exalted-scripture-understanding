Wind and steel, then only blood: this is the Storm of Flying Swords.
The stylist makes an undodgeable withering or decisive attack against all enemies within close range. This increases to short at Arsenal 3+ and medium at Arsenal 5+. A withering attack awards Initiative only for the highest damage roll. A decisive attack divides the stylist’s Initiative evenly among enemies, rounding up, for damage. Battle groups and trivial enemies suffer her full Initiative in damage instead.


## Special activation rules

The stylist can use this Charm reflexively when she uses Sword-Shrike’s Garden or Thousand Daiklave Wings, waiving its Willpower cost.

## Terrestrial
This Charm’s special activation rules can’t be used.
